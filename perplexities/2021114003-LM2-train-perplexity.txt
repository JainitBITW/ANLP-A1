<SOS> chapter i . <EOS>	53.0042122044357
<SOS> the shade of cardinal richelieu . <EOS>	50.385594307741044
<SOS> in a splendid chamber of the palais royal , formerly styled the palais cardinal , a man was sitting in deep reverie , his head supported on his hands , leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers . <EOS>	57.44057394866313
<SOS> behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames ; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room , which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights . <EOS>	71.52496395123114
<SOS> any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace , or who gazed on that pale brow , bent in anxious meditation , might , in the solitude of that apartment , combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place , have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt . <EOS>	95.84582141508362
<SOS> it was , alas ! <EOS>	67.18767587508188
<SOS> the ghost of former greatness . <EOS>	85.37029144397279
<SOS> france enfeebled , the authority of her sovereign contemned , her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence , her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence . <EOS>	72.91438336759927
<SOS> in truth , that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer , was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed , as we have observed , more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers , and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule , which , arising from the streets below , penetrated through the very casements of the room , which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister ; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off , happily , without other end or aim , except to show to the guards , the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal , that the people were possessed of arms . <EOS>	96.75907925765793
<SOS> the shade of richelieu was mazarin . <EOS>	82.94606920350036
<SOS> now mazarin was alone and defenceless , as he well knew . <EOS>	81.0022523053725
<SOS> `` foreigner ! '' <EOS>	46.700326806491375
<SOS> he ejaculated , `` italian ! <EOS>	72.39239712613336
<SOS> that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated , hanged , and made away with concini ; and if i gave them their way they would assassinate , hang , and make away with me in the same manner , although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then . <EOS>	61.493902932208925
<SOS> idiots ! <EOS>	121.36784085933621
<SOS> ignorant of their real enemies , they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly , but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent , who are their real foes . <EOS>	55.42408313322465
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' mazarin continued , whilst his wonted smile , full of subtlety , lent a strange expression to his pale lips ; `` yes , these noises prove to me , indeed , that the destiny of favorites is precarious ; but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite . <EOS>	64.4761223353431
<SOS> no ! <EOS>	93.78417582005457
<SOS> the earl of essex , 't is true , wore a splendid ring , set with diamonds , given him by his royal mistress , whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold , with a cipher on it and a date ; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal , * so they will never ruin me , as they long to do , and whilst they shout , 'down with mazarin ! ' <EOS>	116.34707499332175
<SOS> i , unknown , and unperceived by them , incite them to cry out , 'long live the duke de beaufort ' one day ; another , 'long live the prince de conde ; ' and again , 'long live the parliament ! ' '' <EOS>	80.87475176878078
<SOS> and at this word the smile on the cardinal 's lips assumed an expression of hatred , of which his mild countenance seemed incapable . <EOS>	105.19302445820206
<SOS> `` the parliament ! <EOS>	59.83379059721469
<SOS> we shall soon see how to dispose , '' he continued , `` of the parliament ! <EOS>	116.08789337466446
<SOS> both orleans and montargis are ours . <EOS>	77.89455843093388
<SOS> it will be a work of time , but those who have begun by crying out : down with mazarin ! <EOS>	52.7841488116166
<SOS> will finish by shouting out , down with all the people i have mentioned , each in his turn . <EOS>	47.3694015967755
<SOS> * it is said that mazarin , who , though a cardinal , had not taken such vows as to prevent it , was secretly married to anne of austria . <EOS>	55.39645881256328
<SOS> la porte 's memoirs . <EOS>	71.87563123613437
<SOS> `` richelieu , whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death , was even less popular than i am . <EOS>	118.70847815103443
<SOS> often he was driven away , oftener still had he a dread of being sent away . <EOS>	81.01683027325551
<SOS> the queen will never banish me , and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me ; if i fly , she will fly ; and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen . <EOS>	106.17989540321568
<SOS> `` oh , were i not a foreigner ! <EOS>	48.690217958854525

<SOS> were i but of gentle birth ! '' <EOS>	88.83575670582661
<SOS> the position of the cardinal was indeed critical , and recent events had added to his difficulties . <EOS>	57.02345137984068
<SOS> discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france . <EOS>	100.08446357775037
<SOS> crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by mazarin , whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people , as the advocate general talon described it , had nothing left to them except their souls ; and as those could not be sold by auction , they began to murmur . <EOS>	58.26601139848773
<SOS> patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france ; laurels , however , were not meat and drink , and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent . <EOS>	38.845614004150086
<SOS> had this been all , it might not , perhaps , have greatly signified ; for when the lower classes alone complained , the court of france , separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie , seldom listened to their voice ; but unluckily , mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests , at a high price ; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places , and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place , the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves , and , enraged , swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number , but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue ; and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance , to combine to indemnify him for his loss . <EOS>	65.84972877333357
<SOS> now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties . <EOS>	68.41687281390922
<SOS> on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property . <EOS>	95.43959562933586
<SOS> they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans , who , according to his custom , affected popularity . <EOS>	63.53450428863437
<SOS> the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax , even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms . <EOS>	63.77512511021554
<SOS> they were listened to with great politeness by the duke , who held out hopes of easier measures , promised to speak in their behalf to the queen , and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty , `` we will see what we can do . '' <EOS>	63.379734919345886
<SOS> two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done ; and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned . <EOS>	56.41082075574621
<SOS> this man , named emery , was the object of popular detestation , in the first place because he was superintendent of finance , and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated ; in the second place , because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred . <EOS>	80.92458823905412
<SOS> he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli , who , after becoming a bankrupt , chose to change his name to emery ; and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude , had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii . <EOS>	54.37303676431969
<SOS> under his assumed name , in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held . <EOS>	107.7222578649609
<SOS> `` you surprise me ! '' <EOS>	53.96703396078926
<SOS> exclaimed the monarch . <EOS>	108.2926803393197
<SOS> `` i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d'emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity . <EOS>	41.81730117194063
<SOS> i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me . '' <EOS>	64.36401727948892
<SOS> `` sire , '' replied richelieu , `` rest assured that particelli , the man to whom your majesty refers , has been hanged . '' <EOS>	66.34041840792737
<SOS> `` ah ; so much the better ! '' <EOS>	85.8290604309993
<SOS> exclaimed the king . <EOS>	62.88775274699187
<SOS> `` it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just , '' and he signed emery 's appointment . <EOS>	101.2281967592548
<SOS> this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance . <EOS>	57.13353882478
<SOS> he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling , declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before , near the palace . <EOS>	49.09295822517982
<SOS> the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife , whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe . <EOS>	92.3556040607033
<SOS> this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus , who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket , became secretary of state , and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself . <EOS>	80.51768082270102
<SOS> the fact was that emery 's son had run a great chance of being suffocated , one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed . <EOS>	73.09786491588625
<SOS> nothing , therefore , was settled that day , as emery 's head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence . <EOS>	89.60070567652197
<SOS> on the next day mathieu molé , the chief president , whose courage at this crisis , says the cardinal de retz , was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condé in other words , of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn . <EOS>	52.522052108521905
<SOS> the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them . <EOS>	41.99341448063738
<SOS> but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness , without betraying either disturbance or surprise , that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king 's wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them . <EOS>	95.42308561639872
<SOS> to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected ; they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people 's misery . <EOS>	112.98894285472382
<SOS> nor was this all . <EOS>	88.58088794646473
<SOS> on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame , as she always did on saturdays , was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice . <EOS>	49.29971116574497
<SOS> these poor creatures had no bad intentions . <EOS>	76.45364392036956
<SOS> they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign , and that they might move her to compassion ; but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way , haughtily disdainful of their entreaties . <EOS>	57.723923397371045
<SOS> at length parliament was convoked ; the authority of the king was to be maintained . <EOS>	75.55855995923154
<SOS> one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king , louis xiv. , then ten years of age , went in state , under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox , to notre dame . <EOS>	58.28351904883772
<SOS> he took the opportunity of calling out his guard , the swiss troops and the musketeers , and he had planted them round the palais royal , on the quays , and on the pont neuf . <EOS>	63.80845522573406
<SOS> after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house , where , upon the throne , he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed , but issued new ones , each one , according to cardinal de retz , more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president , molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes . <EOS>	86.20505458161122
<SOS> the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal . <EOS>	86.51809397785638
<SOS> all minds were uneasy , most were foreboding , many of the people used threatening language . <EOS>	52.55304141703472
<SOS> at first , indeed , they were doubtful whether the king 's visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens ; but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased , when cries of `` down with mazarin ! '' <EOS>	95.2779462229217
<SOS> `` long live broussel ! '' <EOS>	81.57357611846358
<SOS> `` long live blancmesnil ! '' <EOS>	70.26426734414764
<SOS> resounded through the city . <EOS>	108.72308159178607
<SOS> for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf , and , although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail , it had none the less won for them the people 's good will . <EOS>	78.33873859470361
<SOS> all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets , or silence their exclamations , were in vain . <EOS>	58.90912434572869
<SOS> orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards , not only to stand firm , but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin , where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous , when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal . <EOS>	76.40708687422287
<SOS> he was shown in directly ; he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued , in two hours paris would be under arms . <EOS>	81.80890423652578
<SOS> deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards , named comminges , made his appearance , with his clothes all torn , his face streaming with blood . <EOS>	79.64741336470725
<SOS> the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on . <EOS>	80.63655424405259
<SOS> as the mayor had foreseen , the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob . <EOS>	51.87252627141037
<SOS> the tocsin was sounded . <EOS>	74.23506228573856
<SOS> comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir ; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds ; the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house . <EOS>	90.95566300016662
<SOS> they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling , but in vain . <EOS>	111.18839058051152
<SOS> comminges , wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead , had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal , followed by a menacing crowd , to tell his story . <EOS>	45.48151683030708
<SOS> this account confirmed that of the mayor . <EOS>	59.3854802690358
<SOS> the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt . <EOS>	45.96444269182092
<SOS> mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf , on account of the ceremonial of the day , and that they would soon withdraw . <EOS>	66.45774078399346
<SOS> in fact , about four o'clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal , the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards , and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance . <EOS>	87.00430861050025
<SOS> such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu . <EOS>	68.9124631379826
<SOS> we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below , which even reached him in his seclusion , and to the guns , the firing of which resounded through that room . <EOS>	42.41539366106861
<SOS> all at once he raised his head ; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution ; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten , and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him , he shrilled it twice . <EOS>	85.62331121517065
<SOS> a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat . <EOS>	68.2039082003937
<SOS> `` bernouin , '' said the cardinal , not turning round , for having whistled , he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him ; `` what musketeers are now within the palace ? '' <EOS>	94.65249836433027
<SOS> `` the black musketeers , my lord . '' <EOS>	99.69311999109897
<SOS> `` what company ? '' <EOS>	64.9121144606571
<SOS> `` tréville 's company . '' <EOS>	65.45184806905989
<SOS> `` is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber ? '' <EOS>	75.79429908307664
<SOS> `` lieutenant d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	55.20198490427039
<SOS> `` a man on whom we can depend , i hope . '' <EOS>	74.13696115080901
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	94.60576445451247
<SOS> `` give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on . '' <EOS>	63.27536955903636
<SOS> the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded . <EOS>	91.90671805403211
<SOS> the cardinal , in deep thought and in silence , began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament , and to attire himself in the military coat , which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace , owing to his former campaigns in italy . <EOS>	68.89761688237067
<SOS> when he was completely dressed he said : `` send hither monsieur d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	61.520714898285
<SOS> the valet went out of the room , this time by the centre door , but still as silently as before ; one might have fancied him an apparition . <EOS>	62.87620353882434
<SOS> when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction . <EOS>	123.6228857068551
<SOS> still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height ; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful ; his glance full of expression ; his nose , though large , was well proportioned ; his forehead broad and majestic ; his hair , of a chestnut color , was curled slightly ; his beard , which was darker than his hair , was turned carefully with a curling iron , a practice that greatly improved it . <EOS>	72.46793935367565
<SOS> after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt , then looked with great complacency at his hands , which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care ; and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first , as belonging to the uniform , he put on others of silk only . <EOS>	53.34901025527471
<SOS> at this instant the door opened . <EOS>	74.26376635087198
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' said the valet de chambre . <EOS>	89.20990115416829
<SOS> an officer , as he spoke , entered the apartment . <EOS>	62.05290690743915
<SOS> he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age , of medium height but a very well proportioned figure ; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy ; his beard black , and his hair turning gray , as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad , more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion . <EOS>	97.22710865927877
<SOS> d'artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment . <EOS>	70.9830671465441
<SOS> how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room ! <EOS>	102.61916648059447
<SOS> seeing , however , no one there except a musketeer of his own troop , he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier , in whose dress , nevertheless , he recognized at the first glance the cardinal . <EOS>	118.57678086968006
<SOS> the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture , such as became a man of good birth , who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles . <EOS>	64.60906382989883
<SOS> the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance , yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said : `` you are monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	55.79666760876696
<SOS> `` i am that individual , '' replied the officer . <EOS>	73.86197247877196
<SOS> mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence , the play of which had been , nevertheless , subdued by age and experience ; and d'artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look , very different , indeed , from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant . <EOS>	114.09961812996734
<SOS> `` sir , '' resumed the cardinal , `` you are to come with me , or rather , i am to go with you . '' <EOS>	94.31734589893944
<SOS> `` i am at your command , my lord , '' returned d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.89025572735949
<SOS> `` i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal ; do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing ? '' <EOS>	109.28407456651705
<SOS> `` danger , my lord ! '' <EOS>	58.10619530225423
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan with a look of astonishment , `` what danger ? '' <EOS>	47.55752101217887
<SOS> `` i am told that there is a general insurrection . '' <EOS>	75.07651677408906
<SOS> `` the uniform of the king 's musketeers carries a certain respect with it , and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns . '' <EOS>	43.55027149042417
<SOS> `` did you witness the injury sustained by comminges ? '' <EOS>	94.30271545856453
<SOS> `` monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers `` `` which means , i suppose , that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards . '' <EOS>	48.97440744019258
<SOS> the cardinal smiled as he spoke . <EOS>	70.55435044752193
<SOS> `` every one likes his own uniform best , my lord . '' <EOS>	76.45055673517281
<SOS> `` myself excepted , '' and again mazarin smiled ; `` for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours . '' <EOS>	91.92481434474047
<SOS> `` lord bless us ! <EOS>	45.15431267433945
<SOS> this is modesty indeed ! '' <EOS>	57.127174661620515
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	58.28936495579057
<SOS> `` had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses , i protest i should be mightily content , and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume `` `` yes , but for to night 's adventure i do n't suppose my dress would have been a very safe one . <EOS>	97.99100083143853
<SOS> give me my felt hat , bernouin . '' <EOS>	75.49112173747675
<SOS> the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim . <EOS>	86.68527360131112
<SOS> the cardinal put it on in military style . <EOS>	74.02044713623191
<SOS> `` your horses are ready saddled in their stables , are they not ? '' <EOS>	70.67327691907829
<SOS> he said , turning to d'artagnan . <EOS>	54.27797068662105
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	80.122354268906
<SOS> `` well , let us set out . '' <EOS>	66.26270964984396
<SOS> `` how many men does your eminence wish to escort you ? '' <EOS>	68.10910590706654
<SOS> `` you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows ; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred , take eight `` `` as many as my lord wishes . '' <EOS>	74.50735417566428
<SOS> `` i will follow you . <EOS>	53.09331893550043
<SOS> this way light us downstairs bernouin . '' <EOS>	88.8697991623282
<SOS> the valet held a wax light ; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal . <EOS>	64.67442966696791
<SOS> chapter ii . <EOS>	76.77666681195132
<SOS> a nightly patrol . <EOS>	58.13098327614277
<SOS> in ten minutes mazarin and his party were traversing the street `` les bons enfants '' behind the theatre built by richelieu expressly for the play of `` mirame , '' and in which mazarin , who was an amateur of music , but not of literature , had introduced into france the first opera that was ever acted in that country . <EOS>	107.82131320963866
<SOS> the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation . <EOS>	53.37195282384674
<SOS> numberless groups paraded the streets and , whatever d'artagnan might think of it , it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance , in order to assume a warlike aspect . <EOS>	72.74371400821335
<SOS> from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets . <EOS>	103.52382490826548
<SOS> the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace . <EOS>	60.366048405868305
<SOS> d'artagnan , meantime , pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression . <EOS>	88.4121970393247
<SOS> when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning ; and the members of the group , whether rebels or not , as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal , at once gave place to the patrol . <EOS>	84.31993630385904
<SOS> the cardinal envied that composure , which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger ; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself , that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage . <EOS>	108.57176512596095
<SOS> on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens , the sentinel cried out , `` who 's there ? '' <EOS>	77.82289877313919
<SOS> and d'artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal `` louis and rocroy . '' <EOS>	76.78617551713016
<SOS> after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost . <EOS>	57.950445700352354
<SOS> the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing , on foot , his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat . <EOS>	90.32539246985935
<SOS> here was the officer d'artagnan was seeking . <EOS>	95.159311132861
<SOS> `` here is monsieur comminges , '' said d'artagnan , returning to the cardinal . <EOS>	84.90362259823608
<SOS> he instantly retired , from a feeling of respectful delicacy ; it was , however , evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback . <EOS>	83.29022679509214
<SOS> `` well done , guitant , '' cried the cardinal to the equestrian ; `` i see plainly that , notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head , you are still the same man , active and zealous . <EOS>	73.0832349926624
<SOS> what were you saying to this youngster ? '' <EOS>	84.0900530273985
<SOS> `` my lord , '' replied guitant , `` i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day 's events are very like those in the days of the ligue , of which i heard so much in my youth . <EOS>	56.05970688812192
<SOS> are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine ? '' <EOS>	78.28789291237291
<SOS> `` and what was comminges saying to you in reply , my good guitant ? '' <EOS>	57.56315903121236
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said comminges , `` i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wanting in my opinion an essential one a duc de guise ; moreover , no generation ever does the same thing twice . '' <EOS>	99.02516391620101
<SOS> `` no , but they mean to make a fronde , as they call it , '' said guitant . <EOS>	48.36314070723644
<SOS> `` and what is a fronde ? '' <EOS>	84.09725402698889
<SOS> inquired mazarin . <EOS>	75.3738156936812
<SOS> `` my lord , fronde is the name the discontented give to their party . '' <EOS>	81.2162408480955
<SOS> `` and what is the origin of this name ? '' <EOS>	87.43071115924124
<SOS> `` it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris , young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears , only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned . <EOS>	61.69573724654264
<SOS> so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called 'frondeurs , ' and yesterday every article sold was ' a la fronde ; ' bread ' a la fronde , ' hats ' a la fronde , ' to say nothing of gloves , pocket handkerchiefs , and fans ; but listen `` at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing : `` a tempest from the fronde did blow to day : i think 'twill blow sieur mazarin away .

<SOS> `` insolent wretch ! '' <EOS>	103.37055126194961
<SOS> cried guitant . <EOS>	44.649103306926854
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said comminges , who , irritated by his wounds , wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow , `` shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester , and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future ? '' <EOS>	55.135142925619604
<SOS> and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle 's saddle bow . <EOS>	90.22832091339004
<SOS> `` certainly not ! <EOS>	75.79343381766395

<SOS> `` diavolo ! <EOS>	112.5938890417833

<SOS> they sing let them pay the piper . <EOS>	102.93067608464108
<SOS> during the ligue , about which guitant was speaking just now , the people chanted nothing except the mass , so everything went to destruction . <EOS>	43.079518066146136
<SOS> come , guitant , come along , and let 's see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens . '' <EOS>	97.22887768741735
<SOS> and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d'artagnan , who instantly put himself at the head of his troop , followed by the cardinal , guitant and the rest of the escort . <EOS>	80.38923494164439
<SOS> `` just so , '' muttered comminges , looking after mazarin . <EOS>	113.50663438997009
<SOS> `` true , i forgot ; provided he can get money out of the people , that is all he wants . '' <EOS>	77.05632143075326
<SOS> the street of saint honore , when the cardinal and his party passed through it , was crowded by an assemblage who , standing in groups , discussed the edicts of that memorable day . <EOS>	61.602334292752744
<SOS> they pitied the young king , who was unconsciously ruining his country , and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin . <EOS>	49.97067974911883
<SOS> addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested . <EOS>	52.52646721394556
<SOS> blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor . <EOS>	70.34525430930131
<SOS> d'artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron . <EOS>	86.96204350079309
<SOS> mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers . <EOS>	78.65141983043009
<SOS> the musketeers , who had already discovered who mazarin was , followed in profound silence . <EOS>	62.31810270747539
<SOS> in the street of saint thomas du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze vingts . <EOS>	70.51706369918281
<SOS> here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns , asking how matters were progressing . <EOS>	85.59105797567395
<SOS> `` ah , captain ! '' <EOS>	75.6876076549668
<SOS> said the officer , `` everything is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house ! '' <EOS>	48.81871914536856
<SOS> and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands . <EOS>	86.29061750241617
<SOS> `` in that hotel ? <EOS>	89.63141817881717
<SOS> it is the hotel rambouillet , '' cried guitant . <EOS>	77.37186941322437
<SOS> `` i really do n't know what hotel it is ; all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there `` `` nonsense ! '' <EOS>	88.69417600030805
<SOS> exclaimed guitant , with a burst of laughter ; `` those men must be poets . '' <EOS>	51.466298757174485
<SOS> `` come , guitant , speak , if you please , respectfully of these gentlemen , '' said mazarin ; `` do n't you know that i was in my youth a poet ? <EOS>	96.41904182437642
<SOS> i wrote verses in the style of benserade `` `` you , my lord ? '' <EOS>	95.34271361476581

<SOS> `` just as you please , my lord . <EOS>	76.07421573242534
<SOS> i do not understand italian . '' <EOS>	61.56718538397512
<SOS> `` yes , but you understand french , '' and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant 's shoulder . <EOS>	77.89270989115946
<SOS> `` my good , my brave guitant , whatsoever command i may give you in that language in french whatever i may order you to do , will you not perform it ? '' <EOS>	104.84847268120154
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	62.08330504820327
<SOS> i have already answered that question in the affirmative ; but that command must come from the queen herself . '' <EOS>	54.367397345405074
<SOS> `` yes ! <EOS>	49.02909048701488
<SOS> ah yes ! '' <EOS>	80.39527061376552
<SOS> mazarin bit his lips as he spoke ; `` i know your devotion to her majesty . '' <EOS>	64.15154837092119
<SOS> `` i have been a captain in the queen 's guards for twenty years , '' was the reply . <EOS>	43.16197080397573
<SOS> `` en route , monsieur d'artagnan , '' said the cardinal ; `` all goes well in this direction . '' <EOS>	57.267471110657425
<SOS> d'artagnan , in the meantime , had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier . <EOS>	78.35154984019273
<SOS> he led the way toward the hill of saint roche . <EOS>	73.06756437440495
<SOS> the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then , owing to their vicinity to the ramparts , less frequented than any others in that direction , for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout . <EOS>	108.53614312444105
<SOS> `` who is in command here ? '' <EOS>	92.13575928938235
<SOS> asked the cardinal . <EOS>	50.62843941109815
<SOS> `` villequier , '' said guitant . <EOS>	54.13915145225401
<SOS> `` diavolo ! <EOS>	50.31408417882713
<SOS> speak to him yourself , for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort , this officer and i have been on bad terms . <EOS>	78.1176064780128
<SOS> he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards . '' <EOS>	61.371034514670626
<SOS> `` i am aware of that , and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong . <EOS>	81.16770443406523
<SOS> the king could not give that order , since at that time he was hardly four years old . '' <EOS>	85.7895737041824
<SOS> `` yes , but i could give him the order i , guitant and i preferred to give it to you . '' <EOS>	56.93142578384253
<SOS> guitant , without reply , rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier . <EOS>	69.49788667981355
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	73.07694200309241
<SOS> so you are here ! '' <EOS>	52.956427149798074
<SOS> cried the officer , in the tone of ill humor habitual to him ; `` what the devil are you doing here ? '' <EOS>	116.55155184360174
<SOS> `` i wish to know can you tell me , pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town ? '' <EOS>	81.69489276437547
<SOS> `` what do you mean ? <EOS>	48.355260209784646
<SOS> people cry out , 'long live the king ! <EOS>	77.54767177778187
<SOS> down with mazarin ! ' <EOS>	56.28537160407227
<SOS> that 's nothing new ; no , we 've been used to those acclamations for some time . '' <EOS>	93.81599900183916
<SOS> `` and you sing chorus , '' replied guitant , laughing . <EOS>	62.785313336067375
<SOS> `` faith , i 've half a mind to do it . <EOS>	44.550918583995525
<SOS> in my opinion the people are right ; and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid , by the way to make the king five years older . '' <EOS>	76.91511211618517
<SOS> `` really ! <EOS>	59.364306718775865
<SOS> and pray what would come to pass , supposing the king were five years older than he is ? '' <EOS>	118.61417275422181
<SOS> `` as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself , and 't is far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	68.79664134033953
<SOS> than the son of peter mazarin . <EOS>	89.69947711534206
<SOS> 'sdeath ! <EOS>	48.384401778730904
<SOS> i would die willingly for the king , but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin , as your nephew came near being to day , there could be nothing in paradise , however well placed i might be there , that could console me for it . '' <EOS>	98.30925031183783
<SOS> `` well , well , monsieur de villequier , '' mazarin interposed , `` i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty . <EOS>	88.0689038247144
<SOS> come , gentlemen , '' addressing the troop , `` let us return . '' <EOS>	90.2026457159698
<SOS> `` stop , '' exclaimed villequier , `` so mazarin was here ! <EOS>	39.12243990858402
<SOS> so much the better . <EOS>	71.49268572496509
<SOS> i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him . <EOS>	75.30854073361945
<SOS> i am obliged to you guitant , although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me , for such an opportunity . '' <EOS>	61.488680064427875
<SOS> he turned away and went off to his post , whistling a tune then popular among the party called the `` fronde , '' whilst mazarin returned , in a pensive mood , toward the palais royal . <EOS>	118.00681365398567
<SOS> all that he had heard from these three different men , comminges , guitant and villequier , confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen ; and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious . <EOS>	76.15584246760871
<SOS> during the whole of this nocturnal ride , during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges , guitant and villequier , mazarin was , in truth , studying more especially one man . <EOS>	84.64016838398622
<SOS> this man , who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred , either at mazarin 's witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being , who , having participated in past events similar to those now occurring , was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place . <EOS>	103.39198404236284
<SOS> the name of d'artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin , who , although he did not arrive in france before the year < num > or < num > , that is to say , about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative , * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage , address and loyalty . <EOS>	60.87728896608492
<SOS> * `` the three musketeers . '' <EOS>	92.3243897302953
<SOS> possessed by this idea , the cardinal resolved to know all about d'artagnan immediately ; of course he could not inquire from d'artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career ; he remarked , however , in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent . <EOS>	55.83382046654753
<SOS> now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself ; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal , the cardinal knocked at a little door , and after thanking d'artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal , he made a sign to guitant to follow him . <EOS>	80.28759110839187
<SOS> they both dismounted , consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door , and disappeared in the garden . <EOS>	95.81259504470202
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' said the cardinal , leaning , as they walked through the garden , on his friend 's arm , `` you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen 's service . '' <EOS>	79.14356510920312
<SOS> `` yes , it 's true . <EOS>	70.92663852380936
<SOS> i have , '' returned guitant . <EOS>	46.91636320889333
<SOS> `` now , my dear guitant , i have often remarked that in addition to your courage , which is indisputable , and your fidelity , which is invincible , you possess an admirable memory . '' <EOS>	76.92566298684764
<SOS> `` you have found that out , have you , my lord ? <EOS>	49.905223270248186
<SOS> deuce take it all the worse for me ! '' <EOS>	81.27174958308731
<SOS> `` how ? '' <EOS>	85.94356211035647
<SOS> `` there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget . '' <EOS>	55.33862808982919
<SOS> `` but you , guitant , are not a courtier . <EOS>	98.4687748028704
<SOS> you are a brave soldier , one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv . <EOS>	66.66958620193999
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	87.5643067097733
<SOS> how few to day exist ! '' <EOS>	57.18347104834817
<SOS> `` plague o n't , my lord , have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me ? '' <EOS>	85.93627254252213
<SOS> `` no ; i only brought you here to ask you , '' returned mazarin , smiling , `` if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers ? '' <EOS>	86.09784340760542
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ? <EOS>	61.048482127121126
<SOS> i have had no occasion to notice him particularly ; he 's an old acquaintance . <EOS>	70.92772880762851
<SOS> he 's a gascon . <EOS>	44.23571087039795
<SOS> de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly , and de tréville , as you know , is one of the queen 's greatest friends . <EOS>	57.88902617696195
<SOS> as a soldier the man ranks well ; he did his whole duty and even more , at the siege of rochelle as at suze and perpignan . '' <EOS>	58.225445228929736
<SOS> `` but you know , guitant , we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage ; we want men of talent . <EOS>	77.39169812092814
<SOS> pray , was not monsieur d'artagnan , in the time of the cardinal , mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out , according to report , quite cleverly ? '' <EOS>	102.12490161376525
<SOS> `` my lord , as to the report you allude to '' guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out `` i know nothing but what the public knows . <EOS>	62.81809729058331
<SOS> i never meddle in intrigues , and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret . '' <EOS>	82.75680612705601
<SOS> mazarin shook his head . <EOS>	86.57150861896083
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	98.83391575786268
<SOS> he said ; `` some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know . '' <EOS>	53.214865506430826
<SOS> `` my lord , '' replied guitant , `` such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance ; they get their information on war from warriors ; on intrigues , from intriguers . <EOS>	52.20284325051655
<SOS> consult some politician of the period of which you speak , and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want . '' <EOS>	92.75503013686352
<SOS> `` eh , pardieu ! '' <EOS>	75.94703598500158
<SOS> said mazarin , with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money . <EOS>	54.93402140383961
<SOS> `` they will be paid , if there is no way of getting out of it . '' <EOS>	62.73356865725734
<SOS> `` does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day ? '' <EOS>	71.92702494006808
<SOS> `` by bacchus ! '' <EOS>	62.644756886382545
<SOS> rejoined mazarin , impatiently , `` it 's about an hour since i asked you for that very thing , wooden head that you are . '' <EOS>	88.18322498611208
<SOS> `` there is one man for whom i can answer , if he will speak out . '' <EOS>	57.23636137982699
<SOS> `` that 's my concern ; i will make him speak . '' <EOS>	63.74806849187745
<SOS> `` ah , my lord , 't is not easy to make people say what they do n't wish to let out . '' <EOS>	113.46859942555308
<SOS> `` pooh ! <EOS>	49.7683000145789
<SOS> with patience one must succeed . <EOS>	69.61048239587093
<SOS> well , this man . <EOS>	69.18413007447471
<SOS> who is he ? '' <EOS>	74.26245944551941
<SOS> `` the comte de rochefort . '' <EOS>	77.54605093890794
<SOS> `` the comte de rochefort ! '' <EOS>	98.3812757435952
<SOS> `` unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i do n't know where he is . '' <EOS>	104.4849764474533
<SOS> `` i know , guitant , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	86.22848374856096
<SOS> `` well , then , how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information ? '' <EOS>	60.214928608606115
<SOS> `` you think , '' resumed mazarin , `` that rochefort `` `` he was cardinal richelieu 's creature , my lord . <EOS>	76.72606230239509
<SOS> i warn you , however , his services will cost you something . <EOS>	90.65238413360161
<SOS> the cardinal was lavish to his underlings . '' <EOS>	98.2126449080828
<SOS> `` yes , yes , guitant , '' said mazarin ; `` richelieu was a great man , a very great man , but he had that defect . <EOS>	78.78685692067417
<SOS> thanks , guitant ; i shall benefit by your advice this very evening . '' <EOS>	93.22354387214125
<SOS> here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal , mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure . <EOS>	80.00968193515955
<SOS> it was d'artagnan , who was waiting for him . <EOS>	95.58013774189034
<SOS> `` come hither , '' said mazarin in his softest voice ; `` i have an order to give you . '' <EOS>	75.11660930183915
<SOS> d'artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase , soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out . <EOS>	42.23966558260145
<SOS> the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it , whilst d'artagnan stood imperturbable , without showing either impatience or curiosity . <EOS>	119.08336863591836
<SOS> he was like a soldierly automaton , or rather , like a magnificent marionette . <EOS>	112.4543784730472
<SOS> the cardinal folded and sealed his letter . <EOS>	90.811817382754
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' he said , `` you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns . <EOS>	76.66488418921759
<SOS> you must take a carriage and an escort , and guard the prisoner with the greatest care . '' <EOS>	60.8233538572481
<SOS> d'artagnan took the letter , touched his hat with his hand , turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant , and a moment afterward was heard , in his dry and monotonous tone , commanding `` four men and an escort , a carriage and a horse . '' <EOS>	76.84281255664582
<SOS> five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses ' shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard . <EOS>	51.762693372863474
<SOS> chapter iii . <EOS>	61.02967339384573
<SOS> dead animosities . <EOS>	75.34574076445878
<SOS> d'artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight . <EOS>	77.04004066943735
<SOS> his visit was announced to the governor , who , on hearing that he came from the cardinal , went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door . <EOS>	80.49170426098442
<SOS> the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay , the brother of the famous capuchin , joseph , that fearful favorite of richelieu 's , who went by the name of the gray cardinal . <EOS>	98.41026443089825
<SOS> during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions , in their dreams of liberty , said to each other : `` as for me , i shall go out of the prison at such a time , '' and another , at such and such a time , the duke used to answer , `` as for me , gentlemen , i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves ; '' meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court . <EOS>	79.21759293524406
<SOS> his prediction was nearly fulfilled , but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed ; for after the death of richelieu everything went on , contrary to expectation , in the same way as before ; and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison . <EOS>	92.56718460264686
<SOS> monsieur du tremblay received d'artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper , of which he was himself about to partake . <EOS>	55.485768340530335
<SOS> `` i should be delighted to do so , '' was the reply ; `` but if i am not mistaken , the words 'in haste , ' are written on the envelope of the letter which i brought . '' <EOS>	105.03792417743327
<SOS> `` you are right , '' said du tremblay . <EOS>	74.1733323066057
<SOS> `` halloo , major ! <EOS>	78.93541350173653
<SOS> tell them to order number < num > to come downstairs . '' <EOS>	61.97086042040181
<SOS> the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased , as he crossed the threshold , to be a man he became a number . <EOS>	55.779210718135744
<SOS> d'artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys ; he remained on horseback , feeling no inclination to dismount , and sat looking at the bars , at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat , but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck . <EOS>	73.00611772047743
<SOS> a bell resounded . <EOS>	73.30662323142464
<SOS> `` i must leave you , '' said du tremblay ; `` i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner . <EOS>	40.17752509548915

<SOS> `` may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish ! '' <EOS>	50.37419898273344
<SOS> murmured d'artagnan , smiling as he pronounced the imprecation ; `` i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard . <EOS>	105.7090450729245
<SOS> go to ! <EOS>	61.18608942874332
<SOS> go to ! <EOS>	110.3355287580807
<SOS> i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile . '' <EOS>	89.8557418246348
<SOS> he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived . <EOS>	103.67062149163914
<SOS> on seeing him d'artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise . <EOS>	83.1778920327186
<SOS> the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer . <EOS>	98.58412487877253
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' thus d'artagnan addressed the four musketeers , `` i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner , and since there are no locks to the carriage , i shall sit beside him . <EOS>	60.55848114324549
<SOS> monsieur de lillebonne , lead my horse by the bridle , if you please . '' <EOS>	42.83663090707141
<SOS> as he spoke he dismounted , gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said , in a voice perfectly composed , `` to the palais royal , at full trot . '' <EOS>	50.66456762660517
<SOS> the carriage drove on and d'artagnan , availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing , threw himself into the arms of the prisoner . <EOS>	50.51711061313256
<SOS> `` rochefort ! '' <EOS>	50.745687281944235
<SOS> he exclaimed ; `` you ! <EOS>	81.44102959780005

<SOS> `` d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	62.27539159188303

<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	95.30109520861035
<SOS> my poor friend ! '' <EOS>	54.83648453599308
<SOS> resumed d'artagnan , `` not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead . '' <EOS>	74.35508593665911
<SOS> `` i'faith , '' said rochefort , `` there 's no great difference , i think , between a dead man and one who has been buried alive ; now i have been buried alive , or very nearly so . '' <EOS>	68.56221114246247

<SOS> `` no ! <EOS>	54.81288773710231

<SOS> `` what reason ? '' <EOS>	71.40624108847956
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	109.74334741971742
<SOS> `` for stealing . '' <EOS>	77.9066416402595
<SOS> `` for stealing ! <EOS>	45.68828688666092

<SOS> `` i admit it . '' <EOS>	59.9857598003909
<SOS> `` well , this is what actually took place : one evening after an orgy in reinard 's apartment at the tuileries with the duc d'harcourt , fontrailles , de rieux and others , the duc d'harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf ; that is , you know , a diversion which the duc d'orleans made quite the fashion . '' <EOS>	75.80309437082869
<SOS> `` were you crazy , rochefort ? <EOS>	97.80253838099634
<SOS> at your age ! '' <EOS>	65.45011802758778
<SOS> `` no , i was drunk . <EOS>	46.479537454880955
<SOS> and yet , since the amusement seemed to me rather tame , i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors , and , in order to see to advantage , that we should mount the bronze horse . <EOS>	101.95687537810511
<SOS> no sooner said than done . <EOS>	98.71561881332673
<SOS> thanks to the spurs , which served as stirrups , in a moment we were perched upon the croupe ; we were well placed and saw everything . <EOS>	86.84142812024731
<SOS> four or five cloaks had already been lifted , with a dexterity without parallel , and not one of the victims had dared to say a word , when some fool of a fellow , less patient than the others , took it into his head to cry out , 'guard ! ' <EOS>	71.69178223182652
<SOS> and drew upon us a patrol of archers . <EOS>	102.29562808438091
<SOS> duc d'harcourt , fontrailles , and the others escaped ; de rieux was inclined to do likewise , but i told him they would n't look for us where we were . <EOS>	118.32982936643147
<SOS> he would n't listen , put his foot on the spur to get down , the spur broke , he fell with a broken leg , and , instead of keeping quiet , took to crying out like a gallows bird . <EOS>	75.83930786143648
<SOS> i then was ready to dismount , but it was too late ; i descended into the arms of the archers . <EOS>	77.28721679684497
<SOS> they conducted me to the chatelet , where i slept soundly , being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free . <EOS>	50.98738095332922
<SOS> the next day came and passed , the day after , a week ; i then wrote to the cardinal . <EOS>	69.36053881227001
<SOS> the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile . <EOS>	51.259587836984984
<SOS> that was five years ago . <EOS>	65.52367628086253
<SOS> do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv. ? '' <EOS>	71.07104198750753
<SOS> `` no ; you are right , my dear rochefort , it could n't be for that ; but you will probably learn the reason soon . '' <EOS>	94.35072443864348
<SOS> `` ah , indeed ! <EOS>	61.09072615635881
<SOS> i forgot to ask you where are you taking me ? '' <EOS>	59.222416193085714

<SOS> `` ah , my poor friend ! <EOS>	57.55348426177064
<SOS> i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung , twenty two years ago , you know ; alas ! '' <EOS>	68.80532584857954
<SOS> and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh . <EOS>	91.7327480368665
<SOS> `` nevertheless , you come as one in authority . '' <EOS>	71.03540844303876

<SOS> `` you are probably nearer freedom than he is , so it will be your business to get him out . '' <EOS>	79.14667221093895
<SOS> `` and , '' said the prisoner , `` what talk is there of war with spain ? '' <EOS>	55.69129278808095

<SOS> `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	64.46973213757536

<SOS> in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d'artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante chamber . <EOS>	85.88497294951296
<SOS> as they stopped at the door of the cardinal 's study , d'artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder . <EOS>	83.36344607147812
<SOS> `` d'artagnan , let me confess to you what i 've been thinking about during the whole of my drive , as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes . '' <EOS>	76.38048099325862
<SOS> `` speak out , '' answered d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.85173636943873
<SOS> `` i had only to cry out 'help ! ' <EOS>	85.96310650278234

<SOS> `` why did n't you do it ? '' <EOS>	68.65831795925807
<SOS> asked the lieutenant . <EOS>	49.62810525668279
<SOS> `` come , come ! '' <EOS>	91.8477155670025
<SOS> cried rochefort . <EOS>	82.03734373725106
<SOS> `` did we not swear friendship ? <EOS>	77.97019600789172
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	67.8505658964463
<SOS> had any one but you been there , i do n't say `` d'artagnan bowed . <EOS>	53.608587216957694
<SOS> `` is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am ? '' <EOS>	91.43649175653321
<SOS> he said to himself . <EOS>	51.70140709899507
<SOS> and he caused himself to be announced to the minister . <EOS>	69.89472919502322
<SOS> `` let m. de rochefort enter , '' said mazarin , eagerly , on hearing their names pronounced ; `` and beg m. d'artagnan to wait ; i shall have further need of him . '' <EOS>	93.50328427708813
<SOS> these words gave great joy to d'artagnan . <EOS>	96.78954408339753
<SOS> as he had said , it had been a long time since any one had needed him ; and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign . <EOS>	99.85554294570525
<SOS> rochefort , rendered suspicious and cautious by these words , entered the apartment , where he found mazarin sitting at the table , dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church , his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day , excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet . <EOS>	76.88785117095091
<SOS> as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin , which was answered by one , equally furtive , from the minister . <EOS>	78.76126770439376
<SOS> there was little change in the cardinal ; still dressed with sedulous care , his hair well arranged and curled , his person perfumed , he looked , owing to his extreme taste in dress , only half his age . <EOS>	74.79069613534138
<SOS> but rochefort , who had passed five years in prison , had become old in the lapse of a few years ; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white ; the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility . <EOS>	107.38310470002021
<SOS> as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly , as much as to say , `` this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much . '' <EOS>	107.46338739311852
<SOS> after a pause , which appeared an age to rochefort , mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter , and showing it to the count , he said : `` i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty , monsieur de rochefort . <EOS>	90.36022484934824
<SOS> you are in prison , then ? '' <EOS>	67.02893057210548
<SOS> rochefort trembled in every limb at this question . <EOS>	82.52867423080379
<SOS> `` but i thought , '' he said , `` that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one `` `` i ? <EOS>	77.08176483204757
<SOS> oh no ! <EOS>	112.03404037245485

<SOS> `` yes , but in regard to myself , my lord , it can not be so , for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence . '' <EOS>	84.94833807815783

<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	104.64546185030807
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	59.92253465948158
<SOS> exclaimed rochefort . <EOS>	65.65677791247448
<SOS> `` there is the true reason ! <EOS>	88.94017551669353

<SOS> `` but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment . <EOS>	92.31231941390618
<SOS> i merely ask you , did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen , whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal ? '' <EOS>	88.92742538413204
<SOS> `` that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels . <EOS>	66.07653776893987

<SOS> i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke , and even then , when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces . <EOS>	94.40449580085132
<SOS> how could i , then , return to brussels ? <EOS>	71.29993776603176
<SOS> i should injure the queen instead of serving her . '' <EOS>	53.121754628450276
<SOS> `` well , since the best motives are liable to misconstruction , the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal ; yes , her majesty the queen `` rochefort smiled contemptuously . <EOS>	52.561413167584156

<SOS> `` why do you doubt it ? '' <EOS>	50.65575709759871

<SOS> `` pray do so , i delight in stories , '' cried the cardinal . <EOS>	65.20843524912954
<SOS> `` listen , then , '' returned rochefort , as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal 's motive . <EOS>	78.47722509120688
<SOS> `` once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe ; and a minister ; and this minister wished much to injure the queen , whom once he had loved too well . <EOS>	80.26967791351106
<SOS> ( do not try , my lord , you can not guess who it is ; all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned . ) <EOS>	74.9708768234621
<SOS> there came to the court an ambassador so brave , so magnificent , so elegant , that every woman lost her heart to him ; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them . <EOS>	74.20596427540656
<SOS> `` as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen 's appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place . <EOS>	110.33240263108148

<SOS> `` well , my lord , four men resolved to save her . <EOS>	77.39465302758745
<SOS> these four men were not princes , neither were they dukes , neither were they men in power ; they were not even rich . <EOS>	59.98418887303426
<SOS> they were four honest soldiers , each with a good heart , a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it . <EOS>	77.02332452362741
<SOS> they set out . <EOS>	67.94517387200827
<SOS> the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination . <EOS>	79.23070351686641
<SOS> three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants ; one of them alone arrived at the port , having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him . <EOS>	64.96803606325923
<SOS> he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen , who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day ; and this very nearly ruined the minister . <EOS>	93.42166860769149

<SOS> `` well , i know of ten such men . '' <EOS>	40.87159480934086
<SOS> mazarin made no reply ; he reflected . <EOS>	76.93758923714209

<SOS> `` and then , my lord , '' continued rochefort , `` you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one 's prison . '' <EOS>	92.20365973056933
<SOS> `` say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort ; that will be the most sincere line of conduct , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	87.47229516654168

<SOS> bernouin came into the room . <EOS>	48.6537752869481
<SOS> `` call an officer of justice , '' he said ; `` and stay close to me , '' he added , in a low tone . <EOS>	88.65487052205698
<SOS> the officer entered . <EOS>	62.07658163295545
<SOS> mazarin wrote a few words , which he gave to this man ; then he bowed . <EOS>	61.98414688990575
<SOS> `` adieu , monsieur de rochefort , '' he said . <EOS>	61.560291999095305
<SOS> rochefort bent low . <EOS>	89.77270674882612
<SOS> `` i see , my lord , i am to be taken back to the bastile . '' <EOS>	79.08807468282016

<SOS> i shall find many men as able as you are . '' <EOS>	59.88402565507145
<SOS> `` i wish you may , my lord , '' replied de rochefort . <EOS>	66.81234935871333
<SOS> he was then reconducted by the little staircase , instead of passing through the ante chamber where d'artagnan was waiting . <EOS>	106.45708452479221
<SOS> in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready , but he looked around in vain for his friend . <EOS>	77.17100523738047
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	85.04143044976311
<SOS> he muttered to himself , `` this changes the situation , and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still , thank god , good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner ; '' and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty . <EOS>	78.4821009905859

<SOS> anne of austria at the age of forty six . <EOS>	67.50367659782856
<SOS> when left alone with bernouin , mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought . <EOS>	64.17178635604908
<SOS> he had gained much information , but not enough . <EOS>	109.1210491005416
<SOS> mazarin was a cheat at the card table . <EOS>	58.533504271859506
<SOS> this is a detail preserved to us by brienne . <EOS>	96.56189609515629
<SOS> he called it using his advantages . <EOS>	53.535211123206814
<SOS> he now determined not to begin the game with d'artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary 's cards . <EOS>	65.44237406217192
<SOS> `` my lord , have you any commands ? '' <EOS>	95.79665547386247
<SOS> asked bernouin . <EOS>	44.85965506897791
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' replied mazarin . <EOS>	86.10277817905825
<SOS> `` light me ; i am going to the queen . '' <EOS>	98.29461088037331
<SOS> bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way . <EOS>	78.29608773232871
<SOS> there was a secret communication between the cardinal 's apartments and those of the queen ; and through this corridor * mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria . <EOS>	63.45359891958006
<SOS> * this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal . <EOS>	56.90678057208933
<SOS> in the bedroom in which this passage ended , bernouin encountered madame de beauvais , like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs ; and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria , who was in her oratory with the young king , louis xiv. , to receive the cardinal . <EOS>	76.28923518162452
<SOS> anne , reclining in a large easy chair , her head supported by her hand , her elbow resting on a table , was looking at her son , who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures . <EOS>	88.73479134592395
<SOS> this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity . <EOS>	95.4054522937338
<SOS> it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room , without either reading or praying . <EOS>	60.108064775236706
<SOS> when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal , the child , who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius , enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander 's feats of arms , frowned and looked at his mother . <EOS>	80.4167941972047
<SOS> `` why , '' he said , `` does he enter without first asking for an audience ? '' <EOS>	101.78762346851182
<SOS> anne colored slightly . <EOS>	43.97696030829935
<SOS> `` the prime minister , '' she said , `` is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time , without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court . '' <EOS>	51.4727632903235
<SOS> `` but richelieu never came in this manner , '' said the pertinacious boy . <EOS>	62.570369138342784
<SOS> `` how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did ? <EOS>	57.809457791562885
<SOS> you were too young to know about such things . '' <EOS>	64.70400922327808
<SOS> `` i do not remember what he did , but i have inquired and i have been told all about it . '' <EOS>	56.76728159639727
<SOS> `` and who told you about it ? '' <EOS>	68.9062168810172
<SOS> asked anne of austria , with a movement of impatience . <EOS>	48.0961429539766
<SOS> `` i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions , '' answered the child , `` for if i do i shall learn nothing further . '' <EOS>	87.05006913710326
<SOS> at this very moment mazarin entered . <EOS>	71.23314386478138
<SOS> the king rose immediately , took his book , closed it and went to lay it down on the table , near which he continued standing , in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also . <EOS>	58.449603821035836
<SOS> mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance . <EOS>	64.79011951550744
<SOS> they explained what had occurred that evening . <EOS>	89.07519451012217
<SOS> he bowed respectfully to the king , who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception , but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which , from his infancy , louis xiv . <EOS>	52.98324975839509
<SOS> had entertained toward mazarin , and he endeavored to receive the minister 's homage with civility . <EOS>	52.193004614719584
<SOS> anne of austria sought to read in mazarin 's face the occasion of this unexpected visit , since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired . <EOS>	86.93317107947816
<SOS> the minister made a slight sign with his head , whereupon the queen said to madame beauvais : `` it is time for the king to go to bed ; call laporte . '' <EOS>	78.32971754414797
<SOS> the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed , and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was ; but now he made no reply , but turned pale and bit his lips with anger . <EOS>	78.75414028987646
<SOS> in a few minutes laporte came into the room . <EOS>	68.43366836735325
<SOS> the child went directly to him without kissing his mother . <EOS>	68.76702981321556
<SOS> `` well , louis , '' said anne , `` why do you not kiss me ? '' <EOS>	73.85606178421602
<SOS> `` i thought you were angry with me , madame ; you sent me away . '' <EOS>	57.776687783767564
<SOS> `` i do not send you away , but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you . '' <EOS>	80.44823072361018
<SOS> `` you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion . '' <EOS>	89.5574144076075
<SOS> `` sire ! '' <EOS>	84.90389253087383
<SOS> interposed laporte , in order to turn the subject , `` to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle ? '' <EOS>	85.20105693182127
<SOS> `` to any one , laporte , '' the child said ; and then added in a loud voice , `` to any one except mancini . '' <EOS>	85.8398516157608
<SOS> now mancini was a nephew of mazarin 's and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself , although placed near his person by the minister . <EOS>	72.09088282987146
<SOS> and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal . <EOS>	75.24876579655614
<SOS> `` good , '' said mazarin , `` i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation . '' <EOS>	53.87695663678545
<SOS> `` why do you say that ? '' <EOS>	87.07734832227685
<SOS> asked the queen , almost timidly . <EOS>	72.63976340136084
<SOS> `` why , it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation . <EOS>	107.85908762013752
<SOS> besides , his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me . <EOS>	50.16890798678923
<SOS> that , however , does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service , as i am to that of your majesty . '' <EOS>	50.94142420189863
<SOS> `` i ask your pardon for him , cardinal , '' said the queen ; `` he is a child , not yet able to understand his obligations to you . '' <EOS>	53.843493068226536
<SOS> the cardinal smiled . <EOS>	45.293887765440566
<SOS> `` but , '' continued the queen , `` you have doubtless come for some important purpose . <EOS>	80.37029480960035
<SOS> what is it , then ? '' <EOS>	67.55145347673698
<SOS> mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance . <EOS>	95.96141600206539
<SOS> `` it is likely , '' he replied , `` that we shall soon be obliged to separate , unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy . '' <EOS>	77.51949149778369
<SOS> `` why , '' cried the queen ; `` how is that ? '' <EOS>	43.07085769376958
<SOS> `` because , as they say in the opera of 'thisbe , ' 'the whole world conspires to break our bonds . ' '' <EOS>	67.92125209820395
<SOS> `` you jest , sir ! '' <EOS>	70.73200141875299
<SOS> answered the queen , endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity . <EOS>	59.146899766094606
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	119.95315529276897
<SOS> i do not , madame , '' rejoined mazarin . <EOS>	46.21388085060451
<SOS> `` mark well what i say . <EOS>	94.96302921823322
<SOS> the whole world conspires to break our bonds . <EOS>	45.98660473729374
<SOS> now as you are one of the whole world , i mean to say that you also are deserting me . '' <EOS>	59.24860372530801
<SOS> `` cardinal ! '' <EOS>	60.957143543823456
<SOS> `` heavens ! <EOS>	51.809928428721214
<SOS> did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans ? <EOS>	68.05871364778044
<SOS> or rather at what he said ? '' <EOS>	73.51096648647463
<SOS> `` and what was he saying ? '' <EOS>	62.93305731303504
<SOS> `` he said this , madame : 'mazarin is a stumbling block . <EOS>	60.401020675538796

<SOS> `` what do you wish me to do ? '' <EOS>	100.76564387253228
<SOS> `` oh , madame ! <EOS>	64.8164939880511

<SOS> `` queen , forsooth ! <EOS>	42.37238946204043

<SOS> `` nevertheless , you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like ! '' <EOS>	44.045805826655226
<SOS> `` that is to say , whom you do not like , '' returned the queen . <EOS>	60.339320127181225
<SOS> `` i ! <EOS>	70.44444191591691

<SOS> `` a woman of intrigue , who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m. de richelieu . '' <EOS>	100.38965617405415
<SOS> `` who dismissed madame de hautefort , that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine ? '' <EOS>	91.88948591492499
<SOS> `` a prude , who told you every night , as she undressed you , that it was a sin to love a priest , just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal . '' <EOS>	90.6421469659169
<SOS> `` who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested ? '' <EOS>	57.594706900098146
<SOS> `` an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me . '' <EOS>	69.05374595020993
<SOS> `` you see , cardinal , '' replied the queen , `` that your enemies are mine . '' <EOS>	75.11282116050255
<SOS> `` that is not enough madame , it is necessary that your friends should be also mine . '' <EOS>	72.7792345666819
<SOS> `` my friends , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	46.45673699856286
<SOS> the queen shook her head . <EOS>	60.170474185460066
<SOS> `` alas , i have them no longer ! '' <EOS>	91.46325929044947
<SOS> `` how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity ? '' <EOS>	57.353274845347926
<SOS> `` it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends , monsieur ; because i have acted like queen marie de medicis , who , returning from her first exile , treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and , being proscribed a second time , died at cologne abandoned by every one , even by her own son . '' <EOS>	59.59747504281711
<SOS> `` well , let us see , '' said mazarin ; `` is n't there still time to repair the evil ? <EOS>	58.808912411642545

<SOS> `` yes , among your friends of other times ; among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him . '' <EOS>	76.84265216557336
<SOS> `` what is he aiming at ? '' <EOS>	102.86595593506621
<SOS> murmured the queen , looking uneasily at the cardinal . <EOS>	70.81692805895707
<SOS> `` yes , '' continued his eminence ; `` under certain circumstances , with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses , aided by your friends , you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary . '' <EOS>	80.19436058399913
<SOS> `` i ! '' <EOS>	100.50572331782791

<SOS> `` one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu . '' <EOS>	91.80504521883182

<SOS> `` no ; still there , but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man . <EOS>	62.43558301372828
<SOS> do you know monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	64.00123567895983
<SOS> he added , looking steadfastly at the queen . <EOS>	53.613366887059016
<SOS> anne of austria received the blow with a beating heart . <EOS>	87.95086915438743
<SOS> `` has the gascon been indiscreet ? '' <EOS>	76.8501021551988
<SOS> she murmured to herself , then said aloud : `` d'artagnan ! <EOS>	54.22969541135365

<SOS> `` that 's all you know of him ? '' <EOS>	63.0812638239161
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	81.28208294726923
<SOS> the queen looked at him , surprised . <EOS>	101.42064711933713
<SOS> `` you seem , sir , '' she remarked , `` to be making me undergo a course of cross examination . '' <EOS>	110.99084268574254
<SOS> `` which you answer according to your fancy , '' replied mazarin . <EOS>	66.32825360826847
<SOS> `` tell me your wishes and i will comply with them . '' <EOS>	73.54446994490979
<SOS> the queen spoke with some impatience . <EOS>	105.00964037515011
<SOS> `` well , madame , '' said mazarin , bowing , `` i desire that you give me a share in your friends , as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me . <EOS>	91.7312310336309

<SOS> `` yes , you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water . <EOS>	45.477654235260225
<SOS> there is , however , a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet . '' <EOS>	71.90312749105301
<SOS> `` continue , '' said the queen . <EOS>	93.05184330269228
<SOS> `` well , then , madame , not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants , all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move , nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured , irritated man , who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days . <EOS>	73.39678197739396
<SOS> we have arrested monsieur de beaufort , but he is the least dangerous among them . <EOS>	53.01230153132709
<SOS> there is the prince de condé `` `` the hero of rocroy . <EOS>	70.65200953929204

<SOS> but he is mistaken ; i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point . '' <EOS>	72.31142359981823
<SOS> anne blushed and buried her face in her hands . <EOS>	77.50623639708488
<SOS> `` what am i to do ? '' <EOS>	58.00320286451525

<SOS> `` endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel , in spite of monsieur de richelieu , tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood , to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham . '' <EOS>	80.59633750169525
<SOS> anne arose , full of majesty , and as if touched by a spring , and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful : `` you are insulting me ! '' <EOS>	74.96474962707518
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	76.18930778742933
<SOS> `` i wish , '' continued mazarin , finishing , as it were , the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut ; `` i wish , in fact , that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover . '' <EOS>	80.28368112334293
<SOS> `` again that accusation ! '' <EOS>	42.576137063922324

<SOS> `` i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct ; you have spared me till now , but since you speak of it , once for all , i tell you `` `` madame , i do not ask you to tell me , '' said mazarin , astounded by this returning courage . <EOS>	97.6657337888651
<SOS> `` i will tell you all , '' replied anne . <EOS>	61.85501316990812
<SOS> `` listen : there were in truth , at that epoch , four devoted hearts , four loyal spirits , four faithful swords , who saved more than my life my honor `` `` ah ! <EOS>	56.78290102251696

<SOS> yes , appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor . <EOS>	70.50956959534506
<SOS> however , i swear i was not guilty , i swear it by `` the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear , and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry , a small coffer of rosewood set in silver , and laying it on the altar : `` i swear , '' she said , `` by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover . '' <EOS>	94.17341152556241
<SOS> `` what relics are those by which you swear ? '' <EOS>	114.65773729192523
<SOS> asked mazarin , smiling . <EOS>	104.52008265706836
<SOS> `` i am incredulous . '' <EOS>	96.495581322795
<SOS> the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there , and presented it to the cardinal . <EOS>	86.27346480776069
<SOS> `` open , sir , '' she said , `` and look for yourself . '' <EOS>	76.43429742669412
<SOS> mazarin opened the coffer ; a knife , covered with rust , and two letters , one of which was stained with blood , alone met his gaze . <EOS>	80.09174683626846
<SOS> `` what are these things ? '' <EOS>	81.67630687929531
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	76.66359134020935
<SOS> `` what are these things ? '' <EOS>	69.67030678084488

<SOS> `` these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him . <EOS>	65.70330113909638

<SOS> read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth . '' <EOS>	73.26539709684127
<SOS> but mazarin , notwithstanding this permission , instead of reading the letters , took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen . <EOS>	59.79421827636292
<SOS> the blade was red , for the blood had become rust ; after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning , he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder . <EOS>	57.325542263233594
<SOS> `` it is well , madame , i believe your oath . '' <EOS>	77.44112054443026
<SOS> `` no , no , read , '' exclaimed the queen , indignantly ; `` read , i command you , for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again . <EOS>	69.94692435549885
<SOS> do you think , '' she said , with a ghastly smile , `` that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations ? '' <EOS>	93.63975417510449
<SOS> mazarin , overcome by this determination , read the two letters . <EOS>	101.47019010667073
<SOS> in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again . <EOS>	99.43962867966384
<SOS> this letter had been conveyed by d'artagnan and had arrived in time . <EOS>	61.7613089016573
<SOS> the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham , warning him that he was about to be assassinated ; that communication had arrived too late . <EOS>	98.92241258954189
<SOS> `` it is well , madame , '' said mazarin ; `` nothing can gainsay such testimony . '' <EOS>	109.19772797264346
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied the queen , closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it , `` if there is anything to be said , it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer , d'artagnan , you were speaking of just now , but my hand to kiss and this diamond .

<SOS> as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger . <EOS>	96.7104890608053
<SOS> `` it appears , '' she resumed , `` that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts , on whose finger i remarked it . <EOS>	106.15109992989301
<SOS> i bought it from him , but it belongs to d'artagnan . <EOS>	73.07862626710892

<SOS> `` i will profit by the advice . '' <EOS>	49.04232819507131
<SOS> `` and now , '' added the queen , her voice broken by her emotion , `` have you any other question to ask me ? '' <EOS>	79.45772395297887
<SOS> `` nothing , '' the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner `` except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions . <EOS>	92.97494353280884
<SOS> i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous , even of the past . '' <EOS>	77.40161450250575
<SOS> a smile , which was indefinable , passed over the lips of the queen . <EOS>	75.31206498136409
<SOS> `` since you have no further interrogations to make , leave me , i beseech you , '' she said . <EOS>	71.4335749765963
<SOS> `` i wish , after such a scene , to be alone . '' <EOS>	107.321626016493

<SOS> `` yes , to morrow . '' <EOS>	38.664358793353244
<SOS> the cardinal took the queen 's hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips . <EOS>	72.4094862036649
<SOS> scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son 's room , and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed . <EOS>	64.48196866838268
<SOS> laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep . <EOS>	80.17310888053201
<SOS> anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son ; then she retired as silently as she had come , merely saying to laporte : `` try , my dear laporte , to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal , to whom both he and i are under such important obligations .

<SOS> meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room ; and after asking bernouin , who stood at the door , whether anything had occurred during his absence , and being answered in the negative , he desired that he might be left alone . <EOS>	44.44544971300144
<SOS> when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber . <EOS>	96.22802973367752
<SOS> there d'artagnan was asleep upon a bench . <EOS>	94.29192936904266
<SOS> the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder . <EOS>	57.5624916521696
<SOS> d'artagnan started , awakened himself , and as he awoke , stood up exactly like a soldier under arms . <EOS>	52.798161280868186
<SOS> `` here i am , '' said he . <EOS>	81.18968672786048
<SOS> `` who calls me ? '' <EOS>	54.759958472245486

<SOS> `` i ask pardon of your eminence , '' said d'artagnan , `` but i was so fatigued `` `` do n't ask my pardon , monsieur , '' said mazarin , `` for you fatigued yourself in my service . '' <EOS>	55.30549119384514
<SOS> d'artagnan admired mazarin 's gracious manner . <EOS>	57.53869498163682
<SOS> `` ah , '' said he , between his teeth , `` is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps ? '' <EOS>	86.05809129875632
<SOS> `` follow me , monsieur , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	51.37772876729074
<SOS> `` come , come , '' murmured d'artagnan , `` rochefort has kept his promise , but where in the devil is he ? '' <EOS>	69.71546727946647
<SOS> and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses , but there was no sign of rochefort . <EOS>	75.80102997389956
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' said the cardinal , sitting down on a fauteuil , `` you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man . '' <EOS>	66.57251148525997
<SOS> `` possibly , '' thought d'artagnan , `` but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts ; '' nevertheless , he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin 's compliment . <EOS>	57.248861543966434
<SOS> `` well , '' continued mazarin , `` the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor . '' <EOS>	69.33970068903503
<SOS> there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer 's eyes , which vanished immediately , for he knew nothing of mazarin 's purpose . <EOS>	63.716569935619894
<SOS> `` order , my lord , '' he said ; `` i am ready to obey your eminence . '' <EOS>	61.701504194186356
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' continued the cardinal , `` you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign . '' <EOS>	78.488244677795

<SOS> `` i do n't speak of your warlike exploits , monsieur , '' said mazarin ; `` although they gained you much reputation , they were surpassed by others . '' <EOS>	77.2203633171457
<SOS> d'artagnan pretended astonishment . <EOS>	85.93918170816819
<SOS> `` well , you do not reply ? '' <EOS>	79.72942491489273
<SOS> resumed mazarin . <EOS>	74.08570090554824

<SOS> `` alas , no , my lord ! '' <EOS>	76.93091462312714

<SOS> thought the gascon ; `` is this a snare or not ? <EOS>	108.44140590620015
<SOS> let me be on my guard . '' <EOS>	60.192418555214196
<SOS> and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose , two of the first actors of the day , might have envied . <EOS>	109.4526093766485
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	103.91155536127987

<SOS> `` you will do for me what you have done for the queen ? '' <EOS>	76.6650513918339

<SOS> `` which of my friends , my lord ? '' <EOS>	74.23049317849402

<SOS> `` well , sir , '' returned mazarin , `` prudence is a fine thing , but to day you might regret having been too prudent . '' <EOS>	98.82082300471397
<SOS> `` my lord , pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues . '' <EOS>	76.22616543311068
<SOS> `` but you have been silent for twenty years , sir . <EOS>	58.54317265567652

<SOS> `` the queen ! '' <EOS>	99.60247110926423

<SOS> `` yes , the queen ! <EOS>	76.46430996890184
<SOS> and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond , which she thinks you know . '' <EOS>	61.34221153181234
<SOS> and so saying , mazarin extended his hand to the officer , who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts . <EOS>	60.72493799467064
<SOS> `` 't is true . <EOS>	55.04534443561441

<SOS> it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey . <EOS>	66.55569745696297
<SOS> i am only a lieutenant of musketeers , very poor , and journeys cost money . <EOS>	100.74483952412903
<SOS> `` my intention , '' said mazarin , `` is not that you go with a great following ; my plans require secrecy , and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment . '' <EOS>	49.451631911067935

<SOS> mazarin remained some moments in deep thought , as if he were fighting with himself ; then , going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock , he took from it a bag of silver , and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d'artagnan : `` take this , '' he said with a sigh , `` 't is merely for your journey . '' <EOS>	102.32160298906423
<SOS> `` if these are spanish doubloons , or even gold crowns , '' thought d'artagnan , `` we shall yet be able to do business together . '' <EOS>	81.79673156150184
<SOS> he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket . <EOS>	102.52866412711546
<SOS> `` well , then , all is settled ; you are to set off , '' said the cardinal . <EOS>	44.550950293961776

<SOS> `` the count de la fere , formerly styled athos ; monsieur du vallon , whom we used to call porthos ; the chevalier d'herblay , now the abbé d'herblay , whom we styled aramis `` the cardinal smiled . <EOS>	80.42739812347078
<SOS> `` younger sons , '' he said , `` who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names . <EOS>	45.67031998998039

<SOS> was that it ? '' <EOS>	66.01587892640198
<SOS> `` if , god willing , these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence , '' said d'artagnan , `` i shall venture to express a wish , which is , that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like . '' <EOS>	56.776775293788695
<SOS> `` these gascons , '' said the cardinal , laughing , `` almost beat the italians in effrontery . '' <EOS>	63.23449917088351
<SOS> `` at all events , '' answered d'artagnan , with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal 's , `` they beat them when they draw their swords . '' <EOS>	61.68188065888921
<SOS> he then withdrew , and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money . <EOS>	43.3247594540468

<SOS> `` a hundred pistoles ! <EOS>	79.3974598214038
<SOS> a hundred pistoles ! <EOS>	59.02898126987312
<SOS> for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns ; without reckoning the value of that diamond '' he cast a complacent look at the ring , which he had kept , instead of restoring to d'artagnan `` which is worth , at least , ten thousand francs . '' <EOS>	90.46521149063585
<SOS> he returned to his room , and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort , for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones , he called to bernouin to undress him , regardless of the noises of gun fire that , though it was now near midnight , continued to resound through paris . <EOS>	56.14563614764083
<SOS> in the meantime d'artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne , where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette . <EOS>	68.7968642511674
<SOS> we will explain in a few words how d'artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence . <EOS>	78.45861408896282
<SOS> chapter vi . <EOS>	56.72778914302626
<SOS> d'artagnan in his fortieth year . <EOS>	82.09357115279415
<SOS> years have elapsed , many events have happened , alas ! <EOS>	47.92212647372339
<SOS> since , in our romance of `` the three musketeers , '' we took leave of d'artagnan at no . <EOS>	82.41560421394314
<SOS> < num > rue des fossoyeurs . <EOS>	54.97474269887302
<SOS> d'artagnan had not failed in his career , but circumstances had been adverse to him . <EOS>	52.06251278105787
<SOS> so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character . <EOS>	61.82927696935128
<SOS> he was one of those fine , ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others . <EOS>	71.51931776868085
<SOS> athos imparted to him his greatness of soul , porthos his enthusiasm , aramis his elegance . <EOS>	104.87966166459422
<SOS> had d'artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character . <EOS>	87.12769828299822
<SOS> athos was the first to leave him , in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois ; porthos , the second , to marry an attorney 's wife ; and lastly , aramis , the third , to take orders and become an abbé . <EOS>	50.03502463084545
<SOS> from that day d'artagnan felt lonely and powerless , without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven . <EOS>	83.0608553961122
<SOS> notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers , d'artagnan felt completely solitary . <EOS>	71.833018713222
<SOS> for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge , perishable indeed ; for like all other recollections in this world , these impressions were , by degrees , effaced . <EOS>	72.91563277243979
<SOS> a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization ; and imperceptibly , d'artagnan , always in the camp , always on horseback , always in garrison , became ( i know not how in the present age one would express it ) a typical trooper . <EOS>	71.94675508946982
<SOS> his early refinement of character was not only not lost , it grew even greater than ever ; but it was now applied to the little , instead of to the great things of life to the martial condition of the soldier comprised under the head of a good lodging , a rich table , a congenial hostess . <EOS>	62.9794187051687
<SOS> these important advantages d'artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe . <EOS>	91.40590316769917
<SOS> from the time d'artagnan took quarters in that hotel , the mistress of the house , a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman , twenty five or twenty six years old , had been singularly interested in him ; and after certain love passages , much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d'artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body , that husband had disappeared one fine morning , after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine , carrying away with him money and jewels . <EOS>	84.26478807251624
<SOS> he was thought to be dead ; his wife , especially , who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow , stoutly maintained that death had taken him . <EOS>	66.17475343139819
<SOS> therefore , after the connection had continued three years , carefully fostered by d'artagnan , who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year , each doing credit to the other , the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d'artagnan that he should marry her . <EOS>	51.25115509989321
<SOS> `` ah , fie ! '' <EOS>	59.13387355517698
<SOS> d'artagnan replied . <EOS>	64.07688544234254
<SOS> `` bigamy , my dear ! <EOS>	62.65143275809185
<SOS> come now , you do n't really wish it ? '' <EOS>	93.25210185259972
<SOS> `` but he is dead ; i am sure of it . '' <EOS>	56.93915066182545
<SOS> `` he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged . '' <EOS>	62.258275633040256
<SOS> `` all right ; if he comes back you will kill him , you are so skillful and so brave . '' <EOS>	59.26861392771242
<SOS> `` peste ! <EOS>	89.60993140520848
<SOS> my darling ! <EOS>	90.62939123265318
<SOS> another way of getting hanged . '' <EOS>	45.71181964237802
<SOS> `` so you refuse my request ? '' <EOS>	61.327209245126255
<SOS> `` to be sure i do furiously ! '' <EOS>	72.87280297748615
<SOS> the pretty landlady was desolate . <EOS>	58.627524061341184
<SOS> she would have taken d'artagnan not only as her husband , but as her god , he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache . <EOS>	116.0299217507862
<SOS> then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte . <EOS>	68.7041365354237
<SOS> d'artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart . <EOS>	60.66718396655252
<SOS> there were then great griefs , tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess . <EOS>	109.90230869558827
<SOS> d'artagnan was too grand to promise anything ; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name . <EOS>	61.85541686008566
<SOS> as to that , we know d'artagnan 's courage ; he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle . <EOS>	67.2843341443608
<SOS> he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise ; every one , therefore , believed him to be dead , especially those to whom his death would give promotion . <EOS>	60.52660394849664
<SOS> one believes readily what he wishes to believe . <EOS>	46.39181506916746
<SOS> now in the army , from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief , to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals , all desire some one 's death . <EOS>	70.01905334290528
<SOS> but d'artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that . <EOS>	77.1339580527173
<SOS> after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself . <EOS>	86.62612851951698
<SOS> he gained a village , knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france . <EOS>	79.47607620058608
<SOS> he was petted , tended , cured ; and one fine morning , in better health than ever before , he set out for france . <EOS>	56.018454847180884
<SOS> once in france he turned his course toward paris , and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne . <EOS>	66.24207204255552
<SOS> but d'artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man , complete , except for the sword , arranged along the wall . <EOS>	88.00906858719972
<SOS> `` he has returned , '' said he . <EOS>	85.83032004790059
<SOS> `` so much the worse , and so much the better ! '' <EOS>	61.06508312231089
<SOS> it need not be said that d'artagnan was still thinking of the husband . <EOS>	48.57622946920525
<SOS> he made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk . <EOS>	76.02788260171044
<SOS> `` alone ? '' <EOS>	63.07300693942277
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	72.00598201116595
<SOS> `` with monsieur . '' <EOS>	74.65450707283571
<SOS> `` monsieur has returned , then ? '' <EOS>	63.12036485526292
<SOS> `` of course , '' naively replied the servant . <EOS>	49.154318946968885
<SOS> `` if i had any money , '' said d'artagnan to himself , `` i would go away ; but i have none . <EOS>	88.4243532838962
<SOS> i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess , while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition . '' <EOS>	86.22774488325557
<SOS> he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid , watching at the door , suddenly cried out : `` ah ! <EOS>	68.7901601693671
<SOS> see ! <EOS>	50.211388892569275
<SOS> here is madame returning with monsieur . '' <EOS>	111.63437854138564
<SOS> d'artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss , who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos . <EOS>	89.04540911028069
<SOS> `` is that monsieur ? '' <EOS>	84.03440334268775
<SOS> said d'artagnan to himself . <EOS>	47.40722037884623
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	99.80292206238171
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	82.64624371889431
<SOS> he has grown a good deal , it seems to me . '' <EOS>	67.76769350413156
<SOS> and he sat down in the hall , choosing a conspicuous place . <EOS>	75.03233827537095
<SOS> the hostess , as she entered , saw d'artagnan and uttered a little cry , whereupon d'artagnan , judging that he had been recognized , rose , ran to her and embraced her tenderly . <EOS>	88.89684840407605
<SOS> the swiss , with an air of stupefaction , looked at the hostess , who turned pale . <EOS>	69.4956805703738
<SOS> `` ah , it is you , monsieur ! <EOS>	100.98976320900793
<SOS> what do you want of me ? '' <EOS>	73.13611595884478
<SOS> she asked , in great distress . <EOS>	75.2925539808688
<SOS> `` is monsieur your cousin ? <EOS>	105.11901149272454
<SOS> is monsieur your brother ? '' <EOS>	68.53691051893999
<SOS> said d'artagnan , not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing . <EOS>	57.41056681631743
<SOS> and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian , who received him with great coldness . <EOS>	54.94175643445458
<SOS> `` who is that man ? '' <EOS>	78.37263830098179
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	102.13330573783644
<SOS> the hostess replied only by gasps . <EOS>	73.68488221856092
<SOS> `` who is that swiss ? '' <EOS>	44.006023986991664
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	60.526872046642275
<SOS> `` monsieur is going to marry me , '' replied the hostess , between two gasps . <EOS>	87.92514322150154
<SOS> `` your husband , then , is at last dead ? '' <EOS>	107.19142328925673
<SOS> `` how does that concern you ? '' <EOS>	95.61511916177862
<SOS> replied the swiss . <EOS>	66.26904745183437
<SOS> `` it concerns me much , '' said d'artagnan , `` since you can not marry madame without my consent and since `` `` and since ? '' <EOS>	75.72877126839904
<SOS> asked the swiss . <EOS>	87.50929822433932
<SOS> `` and since i do not give it , '' said the musketeer . <EOS>	63.510329224740374
<SOS> the swiss became as purple as a peony . <EOS>	103.12537606075485
<SOS> he wore his elegant uniform , d'artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak ; the swiss was six feet high , d'artagnan was hardly more than five ; the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d'artagnan as an intruder . <EOS>	94.05202846676649
<SOS> `` will you go away from here ? '' <EOS>	95.16390672291234
<SOS> demanded the swiss , stamping violently , like a man who begins to be seriously angry . <EOS>	70.51152178172683
<SOS> `` i ? <EOS>	73.97801699500869
<SOS> by no means ! '' <EOS>	104.92376354029889
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	47.75725065663647
<SOS> `` some one must go for help , '' said a lad , who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man , who was so large . <EOS>	109.43368549284942
<SOS> d'artagnan , with a sudden accession of wrath , seized the lad by the ear and led him apart , with the injunction : `` stay you where you are and do n't you stir , or i will pull this ear off . <EOS>	119.03262397284318
<SOS> as for you , illustrious descendant of william tell , you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me , and go out quickly to another lodging . '' <EOS>	60.44641288395904
<SOS> the swiss began to laugh boisterously . <EOS>	82.98561871709109
<SOS> `` i go out ? '' <EOS>	52.03670040293797
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	56.38624293705207
<SOS> `` and why ? '' <EOS>	62.8280924568513
<SOS> `` ah , very well ! '' <EOS>	99.24967731633338
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` i see that you understand french . <EOS>	88.2320159987184
<SOS> come then , and take a turn with me and i will explain . '' <EOS>	76.10746121143904
<SOS> the hostess , who knew d'artagnan 's skill with the sword , began to weep and tear her hair . <EOS>	59.167164438473606
<SOS> d'artagnan turned toward her , saying , `` then send him away , madame . '' <EOS>	93.04668877183641
<SOS> `` pooh ! '' <EOS>	43.00951358439976
<SOS> said the swiss , who had needed a little time to take in d'artagnan 's proposal , `` pooh ! <EOS>	104.51295285710005
<SOS> who are you , in the first place , to ask me to take a turn with you ? '' <EOS>	45.75010907265529
<SOS> `` i am lieutenant in his majesty 's musketeers , '' said d'artagnan , `` and consequently your superior in everything ; only , as the question now is not of rank , but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours ; the first to return will recover his chamber . '' <EOS>	83.31408409878614
<SOS> d'artagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess , who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover , though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand . <EOS>	90.02177518003083
<SOS> it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle . <EOS>	75.57451015767731
<SOS> d'artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber ; the swiss refused by shaking his head , and drew his sword . <EOS>	66.02159609430628
<SOS> `` then you will lie here , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	102.30361049585953
<SOS> `` it is a wretched bed , but that is not my fault , and it is you who have chosen it . '' <EOS>	53.48247930884909
<SOS> with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary . <EOS>	117.26396777222035
<SOS> he had to contend against a strong wrist , but his agility was superior to all force . <EOS>	81.41438886922509
<SOS> the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it , by reason of the cold ; but suddenly feebleness , occasioned by loss of blood , obliged him to sit down . <EOS>	84.45753610373943
<SOS> `` there ! '' <EOS>	96.57551335284201
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` what did i tell you ? <EOS>	55.73023977944382
<SOS> fortunately , you wo n't be laid up more than a fortnight . <EOS>	60.9695715918215
<SOS> remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy . <EOS>	56.72427320542579
<SOS> good by ! <EOS>	94.3181198992018
<SOS> oh , by the way , you 'd better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote . <EOS>	57.021189782349964
<SOS> you will be well fed there , if the hostess remains the same . <EOS>	83.16390917574851
<SOS> adieu . '' <EOS>	94.17045648382626
<SOS> thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him . <EOS>	42.687670354292955
<SOS> the boy found him sitting where d'artagnan had left him , still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary . <EOS>	72.01997328638925
<SOS> the boy , the hostess , and all the house had the same regard for d'artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors . <EOS>	45.75052872858414
<SOS> but when he was alone with the hostess he said : `` now , pretty madeleine , you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman . <EOS>	65.61140060934244
<SOS> as for you , you have acted like a barmaid . <EOS>	84.8722144425298
<SOS> so much the worse for you , for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage . <EOS>	71.53729990027321
<SOS> i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you , but i shall lodge here no longer . <EOS>	96.73991767006365
<SOS> i will not sleep where i must scorn . <EOS>	58.88728749237455
<SOS> ho , there , boy ! <EOS>	82.05055551416996
<SOS> have my valise carried to the muid d'amour , rue des bourdonnais . <EOS>	60.950338146162224
<SOS> adieu , madame . '' <EOS>	72.40569672081875
<SOS> in saying these words d'artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved . <EOS>	80.4209821849468
<SOS> the hostess threw herself at his feet , asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence . <EOS>	77.92637396907924
<SOS> what more need be said ? <EOS>	57.307787171337864
<SOS> the spit turned , the stove roared , the pretty madeleine wept ; d'artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger , cold and love . <EOS>	81.2537871505305
<SOS> he pardoned , and having pardoned he remained . <EOS>	105.20974094351196
<SOS> and this explains how d'artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne , at the hotel de la chevrette . <EOS>	67.02595372857449
<SOS> d'artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood , finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin 's bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister 's finger that night . <EOS>	68.04834137290042
<SOS> `` should that diamond ever fall into my hands again , '' he reflected , `` i would turn it at once into money ; i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father 's chateau , which is a pretty place , well enough , but with no land to it at all , except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents ; and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress , attracted by my good looks , rode along to marry me . <EOS>	117.87453315749177
<SOS> then i should like to have three sons ; i should make the first a nobleman , like athos ; the second a good soldier , like porthos ; the third an excellent abbé , like aramis . <EOS>	53.72323970874114
<SOS> faith ! <EOS>	49.492568936920556
<SOS> that would be a far better life than i lead now ; but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch , who wo n't dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor . '' <EOS>	64.05345588690687
<SOS> on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house . <EOS>	65.50699420010345
<SOS> `` oho ! '' <EOS>	89.89245567318902
<SOS> said he , `` is the hotel on fire ? '' <EOS>	109.73959854192105
<SOS> on approaching the hotel of the roe he found , however , that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected . <EOS>	83.90171768035657
<SOS> the people were shouting and running about with torches . <EOS>	85.12516374937508
<SOS> by the light of one of these torches d'artagnan perceived men in uniform . <EOS>	66.47080847865386
<SOS> he asked what was going on . <EOS>	82.70964516947284
<SOS> he was told that twenty citizens , headed by one man , had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal 's bodyguard ; but a reinforcement having come up , the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings ; the house was now being searched . <EOS>	51.47093842173993
<SOS> in his youth d'artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military , but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities ; besides , he had the cardinal 's hundred pistoles in his pocket , so he went into the hotel without a word . <EOS>	86.43640659490389
<SOS> there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening , but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy . <EOS>	63.768924903244915
<SOS> he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom . <EOS>	67.53311299515846
<SOS> he had been contented , for the convenience of the house , to lodge in the fourth story ; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof . <EOS>	62.191868346226066
<SOS> his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money , and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table . <EOS>	63.562720012929624
<SOS> not to reflect on what had passed , as one might fancy . <EOS>	103.03263296176789
<SOS> no , d'artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time . <EOS>	62.39358201018869
<SOS> he was hungry ; he supped , he went to bed . <EOS>	51.12783135007073
<SOS> neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it . <EOS>	76.13463991211606
<SOS> in the night he slept , but in the morning , refreshed and calm , he was inspired with his clearest views of everything . <EOS>	58.53033524432051
<SOS> it was long since he had any reason for his morning 's inspiration , but he always slept all night long . <EOS>	72.12873945970404
<SOS> at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room . <EOS>	48.09228290587909
<SOS> `` in ' < num > , '' he said , `` just before the death of the late cardinal , i received a letter from athos . <EOS>	72.25464836357528
<SOS> where was i then ? <EOS>	102.43475280380792
<SOS> let me see . <EOS>	90.14244792190819
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	53.41974885662641
<SOS> at the siege of besancon i was in the trenches . <EOS>	40.09761855446233
<SOS> he told me let me think what was it ? <EOS>	95.99145705827594
<SOS> that he was living on a small estate but where ? <EOS>	59.11748629026204
<SOS> i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away , i suppose to the spaniards ; there 's no use in thinking any more about athos . <EOS>	87.99247264775474
<SOS> let me see : with regard to porthos , i received a letter from him , too . <EOS>	83.26024293361534
<SOS> he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september , < num > . <EOS>	76.46510228836716
<SOS> unluckily , as i was then in bearn , on account of my father 's death , the letter followed me there . <EOS>	69.090409989895
<SOS> i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of april , < num > ; and as the invitation was for september , < num > , i could n't accept it . <EOS>	72.49451306350703
<SOS> let me look for this letter ; it must be with my title deeds . '' <EOS>	74.56782573720274
<SOS> d'artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room , and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family . <EOS>	111.0483555620214
<SOS> he uttered an exclamation of delight , for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible , and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse . <EOS>	80.74500846131639
<SOS> d'artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter ; it was dated from the chateau du vallon . <EOS>	99.85629921852791
<SOS> porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary ; in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon . <EOS>	82.31446500871904
<SOS> `` devil take the vain fellow , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.23888790731789
<SOS> `` however , i had better find him out first , since he ca n't want money . <EOS>	93.31440991180912
<SOS> athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking . <EOS>	84.75557282455333
<SOS> aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion . '' <EOS>	56.54916084901728
<SOS> he cast his eyes again on the letter . <EOS>	78.26448998443396
<SOS> there was a postscript : `` i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent . '' <EOS>	78.43653184773248
<SOS> `` in his convent ! <EOS>	56.243246853102306
<SOS> what convent ? <EOS>	47.59250714815564
<SOS> there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france ; and then , perhaps , on entering the convent he changed his name . <EOS>	62.32893044089853
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	91.76603788287046
<SOS> if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits , when we were at crevecoeur ; i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron . <EOS>	105.73242489718312
<SOS> `` well , suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find , even into the nunneries ? <EOS>	79.93943134926874
<SOS> it would be a curious idea , and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles . <EOS>	69.28081895151617

<SOS> yes , yes ; but now what did i do with that letter ? '' <EOS>	75.49231945761193
<SOS> d'artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes . <EOS>	62.07603627137657
<SOS> he looked for his doublet of the year < num > and as he had orderly habits , he found it hanging on its nail . <EOS>	90.0639605995805
<SOS> he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper ; it was the letter of aramis : `` monsieur d'artagnan : you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman , who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale . <EOS>	43.82645202620343
<SOS> as i am of the church , and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you , i write to beg that you will serve me as second . <EOS>	114.25456886596847

<SOS> `` wholly yours , `` aramis . '' <EOS>	66.01000954329653
<SOS> d'artagnan tried to recall his remembrances . <EOS>	74.26439648063592
<SOS> he had gone to the rendezvous , had encountered there the adversary indicated , whose name he had never known , had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm , then had gone toward aramis , who at the same time came to meet him , having already finished his affair . <EOS>	79.91195646068907
<SOS> `` it is over , '' aramis had said . <EOS>	95.48989394788391
<SOS> `` i think i have killed the insolent fellow . <EOS>	83.11858802185488
<SOS> but , dear friend , if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you . '' <EOS>	79.54499046461537
<SOS> thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades . <EOS>	88.41670483341426
<SOS> so , then , he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were , and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity , when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window . <EOS>	55.842248444206106
<SOS> he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping . <EOS>	78.34965766134113
<SOS> he was not mistaken ; as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window . <EOS>	59.334262461655655
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	81.12494621048373

<SOS> `` perhaps so , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	54.854383887194494
<SOS> `` but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o'clock of the morning in the month of january ? '' <EOS>	83.14176254554421
<SOS> `` sir , '' said planchet , `` you must know ; but , perhaps you ought not to know `` `` tell us what , '' returned d'artagnan , `` but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains . '' <EOS>	95.8717446114196
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the prudent planchet , `` in the first place , are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort ? '' <EOS>	78.13641859576408

<SOS> `` ah , sir ! <EOS>	114.87380419588584
<SOS> i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is `` planchet hesitated . <EOS>	84.53263025054132
<SOS> `` egad , i know where he is , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	97.68663784478684
<SOS> `` he 's in the bastile . '' <EOS>	67.68854815417596
<SOS> `` that is to say , he was there , '' replied planchet . <EOS>	59.10233606451826
<SOS> `` but in returning thither last night , when fortunately you did not accompany him , as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people , who began to abuse them . <EOS>	67.79732640163893
<SOS> the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape ; he called out his name and cried for help . <EOS>	44.6040254218529
<SOS> i was there . <EOS>	53.18427719808304
<SOS> i heard the name of rochefort . <EOS>	47.028363214446415
<SOS> i remembered him well . <EOS>	110.27062443677599
<SOS> i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner , a friend of the duc de beaufort , who called for help . <EOS>	75.56333503751168
<SOS> the people were infuriated ; they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces , whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd . <EOS>	104.95367212617857
<SOS> at this moment a patrol passed by . <EOS>	81.53070718512606
<SOS> i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne ; i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this , where i have been concealed between two mattresses . <EOS>	105.82450102976726

<SOS> `` poor fellow ! '' <EOS>	101.54474141497519

<SOS> `` ah , sir , you are going to save my life a second time ! '' <EOS>	67.92842602956925
<SOS> cried planchet . <EOS>	60.5766080468703
<SOS> and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs , whilst d'artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances . <EOS>	66.96606253595951
<SOS> while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table . <EOS>	68.06439109481681
<SOS> at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused , as if he had partially appeased his hunger . <EOS>	40.71807643962827
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan , who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations , `` dost thou know where athos is ? '' <EOS>	49.36821579240925

<SOS> `` without a doubt he must . '' <EOS>	76.4889528703784
<SOS> d'artagnan thought for a moment , then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out . <EOS>	100.57319792446975
<SOS> `` sir , '' said planchet , in a mournful tone , `` do you abandon me thus to my fate ? <EOS>	110.17850096014948

<SOS> d'artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs . <EOS>	86.05113297715141
<SOS> when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet . <EOS>	89.55241269439384
<SOS> `` my dear landlady , '' said d'artagnan , `` i beg to introduce to you your brother , who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service . '' <EOS>	63.55360334500411

<SOS> `` goeden day , broder , '' replied the astonished landlady . <EOS>	84.25411252597158
<SOS> `` this is the case , '' said d'artagnan ; `` this is your brother , madeleine ; you do n't know him perhaps , but i know him ; he has arrived from amsterdam . <EOS>	91.75207878404655
<SOS> you must dress him up during my absence . <EOS>	61.91964520898482
<SOS> when i return , which will be in about an hour , you must offer him to me as a servant , and upon your recommendation , though he does n't speak a word of french , i take him into my service . <EOS>	83.71193940754807
<SOS> you understand ? '' <EOS>	68.12089308618673
<SOS> `` that is to say , i guess your wishes , and that is all that 's necessary , '' said madeleine . <EOS>	76.54117944666805
<SOS> `` you are a precious creature , my pretty hostess , and i am much obliged to you . '' <EOS>	74.38447051570006
<SOS> the next moment d'artagnan was on his way to notre dame . <EOS>	72.53489899681284
<SOS> chapter vii . <EOS>	89.47342272947822
<SOS> touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have . <EOS>	64.70121765717575
<SOS> d'artagnan , as he crossed the pont neuf , congratulated himself on having found planchet again , for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him ; nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards , a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced , at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party . <EOS>	72.26576209338307
<SOS> it was like having a spy in the enemy 's camp . <EOS>	79.6922386954795
<SOS> in this frame of mind , grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet , pleased with himself , d'artagnan reached notre dame . <EOS>	86.48780176131804
<SOS> he ran up the steps , entered the church , and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel , asked him if he knew monsieur bazin . <EOS>	68.55297196851663
<SOS> `` monsieur bazin , the beadle ? '' <EOS>	54.61278410453452
<SOS> said the verger . <EOS>	46.588839573845384
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	89.75149742029782
<SOS> there he is , attending mass , in the chapel of the virgin . '' <EOS>	61.31658832273987
<SOS> d'artagnan nearly jumped for joy ; he had despaired of finding bazin , but now , he thought , since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end . <EOS>	109.27136270186588
<SOS> he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man ; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him , he made use of his time in gazing at bazin . <EOS>	63.70394312624053
<SOS> bazin wore his dress , it may be observed , with equal dignity and saintly propriety . <EOS>	85.75594334672019
<SOS> it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal 's baton which condé threw , or did not throw , into the enemy 's line of battle at fribourg . <EOS>	71.65922847494706
<SOS> his person had undergone a change , analogous to the change in his dress ; his figure had grown rotund and , as it were , canonical . <EOS>	66.16273038804914
<SOS> the striking points of his face were effaced ; he had still a nose , but his cheeks , fattened out , each took a portion of it unto themselves ; his chin had joined his throat ; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks ; his hair , cut straight in holy guise , covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows . <EOS>	107.90029258884277
<SOS> the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d'artagnan was looking at bazin ; he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired , giving the benediction , which was received by the kneeling communicants , to the astonishment of d'artagnan , who recognized in the priest the coadjutor * himself , the famous jean francois gondy , who at that time , having a presentiment of the part he was to play , was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving . <EOS>	103.42283726501378
<SOS> it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people , generally , alone attended . <EOS>	80.62249383209483
<SOS> * a sacerdotal officer . <EOS>	52.0794721986577
<SOS> d'artagnan knelt as well as the rest , received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross ; but when bazin passed in his turn , with his eyes raised to heaven and walking , in all humility , the very last , d'artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe . <EOS>	81.13163287884976
<SOS> bazin looked down and started , as if he had seen a serpent . <EOS>	73.32436980991399
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	49.99458098863604
<SOS> he cried ; `` vade retro satanas ! '' <EOS>	49.98683672908493
<SOS> `` so , my dear bazin ! '' <EOS>	56.51254273812182
<SOS> said the officer , laughing , `` this is the way you receive an old friend . '' <EOS>	44.348409057738664
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied bazin , `` the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation , not those who hinder him in doing so . '' <EOS>	49.57337580945896
<SOS> `` i do n't understand you , bazin ; nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	71.68464200437866
<SOS> `` you forget , sir , that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master ; and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer , whilst all the time his true vocation was the church . '' <EOS>	44.617386161943756
<SOS> `` my dear bazin , you ought to perceive , '' said d'artagnan , `` from the place in which you find me , that i am greatly changed in everything . <EOS>	78.87304391191267
<SOS> age produces good sense , and , as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation , i want you to tell me where he is , that he may help me to mine . '' <EOS>	77.68542491815401
<SOS> `` rather say , to take him back with you into the world . <EOS>	112.53966957734478
<SOS> fortunately , i do n't know where he is . '' <EOS>	82.97799344147018
<SOS> `` how ! '' <EOS>	87.99017266525
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` you do n't know where aramis is ? '' <EOS>	55.68542899809123
<SOS> `` formerly , '' replied bazin , `` aramis was his name of perdition . <EOS>	74.7821280370165
<SOS> by aramis is meant simara , which is the name of a demon . <EOS>	84.71602446833522
<SOS> happily for him he has ceased to bear that name . '' <EOS>	57.39799691380661
<SOS> `` and therefore , '' said d'artagnan , resolved to be patient to the end , `` it is not aramis i seek , but the abbé d'herblay . <EOS>	87.92641950763478
<SOS> come , my dear bazin , tell me where he is . '' <EOS>	75.29828721471952
<SOS> `` did n't you hear me tell you , monsieur d'artagnan , that i do n't know where he is ? '' <EOS>	68.52493658344548
<SOS> `` yes , certainly ; but to that i answer that it is impossible . '' <EOS>	62.22874217876009
<SOS> `` it is , nevertheless , the truth , monsieur the pure truth , the truth of the good god . '' <EOS>	108.82034846162144
<SOS> d'artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man , who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis , but whose lies were bold and decided . <EOS>	46.67392763514713
<SOS> `` well , bazin , '' said d'artagnan , `` since you do not know where your master lives , let us speak of it no more ; let us part good friends . <EOS>	113.95207003024915
<SOS> accept this half pistole to drink to my health . '' <EOS>	52.117610397041716
<SOS> `` i do not drink '' bazin pushed away with dignity the officer 's hand `` 't is good only for the laity . '' <EOS>	68.12143593738153
<SOS> `` incorruptible ! '' <EOS>	100.8377401138476
<SOS> murmured d'artagnan ; `` i am unlucky ; '' and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy , and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him . <EOS>	75.5669974654041
<SOS> d'artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder . <EOS>	83.03533213845759
<SOS> he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence . <EOS>	49.71347470174908
<SOS> `` you here , rochefort ? '' <EOS>	71.42766988138784
<SOS> he said , in a low voice . <EOS>	64.45631704536125
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	74.34880649855153
<SOS> returned rochefort . <EOS>	52.360087917368084

<SOS> and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d'artagnan shudder , but d'artagnan could now see it without alarm , and smiling in his turn , with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could , perhaps , alone give to his countenance , he said : `` go , demon , do what thou wilt ! <EOS>	80.65440615357626
<SOS> it matters little now to me . <EOS>	76.28289551998037
<SOS> there 's no second constance in the world . '' <EOS>	72.87345389092131
<SOS> on his return to the cathedral , d'artagnan saw bazin , who was conversing with the sacristan . <EOS>	45.48098930593184
<SOS> bazin was making , with his spare little short arms , ridiculous gestures . <EOS>	65.55474092125459
<SOS> d'artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself . <EOS>	65.1863429605373
<SOS> d'artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes ; it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him . <EOS>	95.1929865301981
<SOS> in five minutes bazin made his appearance , looking in every direction to see if he were observed , but he saw no one . <EOS>	78.78646311675719
<SOS> calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame . <EOS>	40.96690401274004
<SOS> then d'artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter , in the rue de la calandre , a respectable looking house ; and this d'artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle . <EOS>	92.88179519993582
<SOS> afraid of making any inquiries at this house , d'artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras . <EOS>	86.00955156851383
<SOS> this beverage required a good half hour to prepare . <EOS>	66.64780530083118
<SOS> and d'artagnan had time , therefore , to watch bazin unsuspected . <EOS>	62.45437476040303
<SOS> he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister . <EOS>	77.00120852844783
<SOS> he questioned him , and as the boy had no interest in deceiving , d'artagnan learned that he exercised , from six o'clock in the morning until nine , the office of chorister , and from nine o'clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern . <EOS>	56.06172566718828
<SOS> whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin 's house . <EOS>	106.89026299289901
<SOS> it was saddled and bridled . <EOS>	73.91873262249707
<SOS> almost immediately bazin came downstairs . <EOS>	118.01445929764965
<SOS> `` look ! '' <EOS>	115.87694495928322
<SOS> said the boy , `` there 's our beadle , who is going a journey . '' <EOS>	63.82600779018164
<SOS> `` and where is he going ? '' <EOS>	109.1774660555872
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	77.95570389378958
<SOS> `` forsooth , i do n't know . '' <EOS>	96.28942697814331
<SOS> `` half a pistole if you can find out , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	74.17441955045223
<SOS> `` for me ? '' <EOS>	89.49596483031692
<SOS> cried the boy , his eyes sparkling with joy , `` if i can find out where bazin is going ? <EOS>	86.75431970306552
<SOS> that is not difficult . <EOS>	60.48942142764709
<SOS> you are not joking , are you ? '' <EOS>	84.67009013467363
<SOS> `` no , on the honor of an officer ; there is the half pistole ; '' and he showed him the seductive coin , but did not give it him . <EOS>	68.17909154178298
<SOS> `` i shall ask him . '' <EOS>	86.37216852415682
<SOS> `` just the very way not to know . <EOS>	60.16651073377544
<SOS> wait till he is set out and then , marry , come up , ask , and find out . <EOS>	85.89422801518265
<SOS> the half pistole is ready , '' and he put it back again into his pocket . <EOS>	68.92699124412805
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said the child , with that jeering smile which marks especially the `` gamin de paris . '' <EOS>	96.25174410072015
<SOS> `` well , we must wait . '' <EOS>	74.2400580174516
<SOS> they had not long to wait . <EOS>	105.38398456060428
<SOS> five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot , urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie , which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip . <EOS>	62.9121899938243
<SOS> scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent . <EOS>	96.75173667592203
<SOS> before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned . <EOS>	52.304754472119676
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	71.37994989175567
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	64.2979747709631
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	105.31471873919305
<SOS> answered the boy , `` the thing is done . '' <EOS>	69.06826645834454
<SOS> `` where is he gone ? '' <EOS>	56.85209875291665
<SOS> `` the half pistole is for me ? '' <EOS>	115.99697640241752
<SOS> `` doubtless , answer me . '' <EOS>	81.25568213223917
<SOS> `` i want to see it . <EOS>	81.39888185760762
<SOS> give it me , that i may see it is not false . '' <EOS>	94.88935734519303
<SOS> `` there it is . '' <EOS>	99.39379715271154
<SOS> the child put the piece of money into his pocket . <EOS>	73.62855889897656
<SOS> `` and now , where is he gone ? '' <EOS>	40.73631192656591
<SOS> inquired d'artagnan . <EOS>	98.05239983729915
<SOS> `` he is gone to noisy . '' <EOS>	80.86361799271118
<SOS> `` how dost thou know ? '' <EOS>	85.95398233244464
<SOS> `` ah , faith ! <EOS>	58.465179185881134
<SOS> there was no great cunning necessary . <EOS>	75.65491321959534
<SOS> i knew the horse he rode ; it belonged to the butcher , who lets it out now and then to m. bazin . <EOS>	62.446537389316205
<SOS> now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going . <EOS>	58.518928372270175
<SOS> and he answered 'that monsieur bazin went to noisy . ' <EOS>	82.53068321422664
<SOS> 't is his custom . <EOS>	98.32997853139987
<SOS> he goes two or three times a week . '' <EOS>	66.32807906971028
<SOS> `` dost thou know noisy well ? '' <EOS>	94.98739674070121
<SOS> `` i think so , truly ; my nurse lives there . '' <EOS>	64.47684061514438
<SOS> `` is there a convent at noisy ? '' <EOS>	59.6119633061289
<SOS> `` is n't there a great and grand one the convent of jesuits ? '' <EOS>	54.403042568349946
<SOS> `` what is thy name ? '' <EOS>	71.06308903762952
<SOS> `` friquet . '' <EOS>	108.43324930081302
<SOS> d'artagnan wrote the child 's name in his tablets . <EOS>	54.23692819708946
<SOS> `` please , sir , '' said the boy , `` do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way ? '' <EOS>	114.67983836329351
<SOS> `` perhaps , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	73.90818598435361
<SOS> and having got out all he wanted , he paid for the hypocras , which he did not drink , and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne . <EOS>	86.84716018902338
<SOS> chapter viii . <EOS>	76.3689589715123
<SOS> d'artagnan , going to a distance to discover aramis . <EOS>	90.10739314694837
<SOS> on entering the hotel d'artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire . <EOS>	69.43804763922836
<SOS> it was planchet , but so completely transformed , thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind , that d'artagnan himself could hardly recognize him . <EOS>	76.3710797349757
<SOS> madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants . <EOS>	72.57655048888506
<SOS> planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase ; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all , and the bargain was concluded ; madeleine 's brother entered d'artagnan 's service . <EOS>	68.07415007036381
<SOS> the plan adopted by d'artagnan was soon perfected . <EOS>	103.42492556717369
<SOS> he resolved not to reach noisy in the day , for fear of being recognized ; he had therefore plenty of time before him , for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris , on the road to meaux . <EOS>	113.3349079272175
<SOS> he began his day by breakfasting substantially a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head , but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body ; and about two o'clock he had his two horses saddled , and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la villete . <EOS>	83.25880234995951
<SOS> a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet . <EOS>	79.21018529671038
<SOS> at about a league and a half from the city , d'artagnan , finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon , stopped to give the horses breathing time . <EOS>	74.53010613791825
<SOS> the inn was full of disreputable looking people , who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition . <EOS>	109.13405228274424
<SOS> a man , wrapped in a cloak , appeared at the door , but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions , and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him . <EOS>	93.06296108687029
<SOS> d'artagnan , on his side , went up to the landlady , praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village ; one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris , and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville ; the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers . <EOS>	78.17607811562428
<SOS> at four o'clock d'artagnan recommenced his journey . <EOS>	110.66188663867459
<SOS> he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie . <EOS>	62.010042904303795
<SOS> planchet also was lost in thought , but the subject of their reflections was not the same . <EOS>	61.23227922398221
<SOS> one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d'artagnan 's deliberations ; this was the name of madame de longueville . <EOS>	61.837426805945796
<SOS> that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought . <EOS>	86.08121755544752
<SOS> madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm ; she was also one of the greatest beauties at court . <EOS>	97.61508910048441
<SOS> she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny , who , for her sake , had been killed in a duel , in the place royale , by the duc de guise . <EOS>	108.63052039115627
<SOS> she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac , the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld , whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé , her brother in law , whom she now hated mortally . <EOS>	107.54079865590496
<SOS> d'artagnan thought of all these matters . <EOS>	61.058991302217834
<SOS> he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen , as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms , the beautiful madame de longueville . <EOS>	71.84093751457566
<SOS> he thought of aramis , who , without possessing any greater advantages than himself , had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse , who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day ; and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish , some in ambition , others in love , whilst others , either from chance , or from ill luck , or from some natural defect or impediment , remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations . <EOS>	55.392835947832225
<SOS> he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class , when planchet approached and said : `` i will lay a wager , your honor , that you and i are thinking of the same thing . '' <EOS>	62.218502762452246
<SOS> `` i doubt it , planchet , '' replied d'artagnan , `` but what are you thinking of ? '' <EOS>	84.46339970749885
<SOS> `` i am thinking , sir , of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested . '' <EOS>	70.28038239475659
<SOS> `` always cautious , planchet . '' <EOS>	85.78637722612874
<SOS> `` 't is instinct , your honor . '' <EOS>	93.36269587293651
<SOS> `` well , what does your instinct tell you now ? '' <EOS>	52.35082262344104
<SOS> `` sir , my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose ; and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me , in the darkest corner of the stable , when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men , came in . '' <EOS>	90.00880174485677
<SOS> `` ah ah ! '' <EOS>	71.76236733462726
<SOS> said d'artagnan , planchet 's recital agreeing with his own observations . <EOS>	70.38783545052536
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	82.0433326748743
<SOS> `` one of these two men said , 'he must certainly be at noisy , or be coming there this evening , for i have seen his servant . ' <EOS>	102.57187451063885
<SOS> `` 'art thou sure ? ' <EOS>	96.19211936678067
<SOS> said the man in the cloak . <EOS>	48.512618492485004
<SOS> `` 'yes , my prince . ' '' <EOS>	65.82867471483442
<SOS> `` my prince ! '' <EOS>	55.85027381942553
<SOS> interrupted d'artagnan . <EOS>	54.56441867064108
<SOS> `` yes , 'my prince ; ' but listen . <EOS>	98.74227894783144
<SOS> 'if he is here ' this is what the other man said 'let 's see decidedly what to do with him . ' <EOS>	74.61624074771022
<SOS> `` 'what to do with him ? ' <EOS>	64.29439418454837
<SOS> answered the prince . <EOS>	74.68743037393271
<SOS> `` 'yes , he 's not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow ; he 'll defend himself . ' <EOS>	84.77034967317009
<SOS> `` 'well , we must try to take him alive . <EOS>	73.04094427038532
<SOS> have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth ? ' <EOS>	66.4806324035062
<SOS> `` 'we have . ' <EOS>	60.72943434110197
<SOS> `` 'remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman . ' <EOS>	67.79953238846427
<SOS> `` 'yes , yes , my lord ; do n't be uneasy . ' <EOS>	101.00655487156692
<SOS> `` 'besides , i shall be there . ' <EOS>	119.71731314002152
<SOS> `` 'you will assure us that justice ' `` 'yes , yes ! <EOS>	107.24053361044668
<SOS> i answer for all that , ' the prince said . <EOS>	60.30920677585259
<SOS> `` 'well , then , we 'll do our best . ' <EOS>	83.157891647624
<SOS> having said that , they went out of the stable . '' <EOS>	81.12027723104306
<SOS> `` well , what matters all that to us ? '' <EOS>	72.21855800374838
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	57.811657850289684
<SOS> `` this is one of those attempts that happen every day . '' <EOS>	66.39801954095408
<SOS> `` are you sure that we are not its objects ? '' <EOS>	101.22474546834613
<SOS> `` we ? <EOS>	96.98417484182265
<SOS> why ? '' <EOS>	55.22223597547531
<SOS> `` just remember what they said . <EOS>	72.41551808318563
<SOS> ' i have seen his servant , ' said one , and that applies very well to me . '' <EOS>	71.50180189874182
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	65.83027499624727
<SOS> `` 'he must certainly be at noisy , or be coming there this evening , ' said the other ; and that applies very well to you . '' <EOS>	79.65689355983012
<SOS> `` what else ? '' <EOS>	69.35920224128358
<SOS> `` then the prince said : 'take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier ; ' which seems to me to leave no room for doubt , since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers . <EOS>	78.11480896075318
<SOS> now then , what do you say to that ? '' <EOS>	99.91270655774838
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	68.16412444181798
<SOS> my dear planchet , '' said d'artagnan , sighing , `` we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me . <EOS>	47.58861927584926
<SOS> those were good old days ; never fear these people owe us no grudge . '' <EOS>	105.97763168093407
<SOS> `` is your honor sure ? '' <EOS>	81.38690387070108
<SOS> `` i can answer for it they do not . '' <EOS>	73.41017277125337
<SOS> `` well , we wo n't speak of it any more , then ; '' and planchet took his place in d'artagnan 's suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master , which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed . <EOS>	72.96767947501719
<SOS> they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d'artagnan . <EOS>	85.4245777025758
<SOS> `` stop , sir , look yonder , '' he whispered ; `` do n't you see in the darkness something pass by , like shadows ? <EOS>	75.46435056638619
<SOS> i fancy i hear horses ' feet . '' <EOS>	79.47193680719131
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	70.20703720213119
<SOS> returned d'artagnan . <EOS>	110.43989337870387
<SOS> `` the ground is soaking wet ; yet i fancy , as thou sayest , that i see something . '' <EOS>	102.04932632984666
<SOS> at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear , coming through darkness and space . <EOS>	88.2206069264893
<SOS> `` there are men somewhere about , but that 's of no consequence to us , '' said d'artagnan ; `` let us ride onward . '' <EOS>	58.416390041475104
<SOS> at about half past eight o'clock they reached the first houses in noisy ; every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village . <EOS>	117.40939762311231
<SOS> the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses . <EOS>	92.44817022264621
<SOS> here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots , from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores . <EOS>	103.2216558927813
<SOS> these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village . <EOS>	86.42635540008082
<SOS> toward the middle of the town , commanding the principal open space , rose a dark mass , separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees . <EOS>	68.55866989345625
<SOS> d'artagnan looked attentively at the building . <EOS>	94.11796343552702
<SOS> `` this , '' he said to planchet , `` must be the archbishop 's chateau , the abode of the fair madame de longueville ; but the convent , where is that ? '' <EOS>	81.39607037774995
<SOS> `` the convent , your honor , is at the other end of the village ; i know it well . '' <EOS>	79.37151879171797
<SOS> `` well , then , planchet , gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horse 's girth , and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits ' windows . '' <EOS>	103.95554899323709
<SOS> in about five minutes planchet returned . <EOS>	110.02904441714722
<SOS> `` sir , '' he said , `` there is one window of the convent lighted up . '' <EOS>	56.747780404647465
<SOS> `` hem ! <EOS>	70.31252250994497
<SOS> if i were a 'frondeur , ' '' said d'artagnan , `` i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper . <EOS>	111.83645459807481
<SOS> if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there , too ; whereas , 't is very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds , dying with hunger and thirst . '' <EOS>	52.878113784721485
<SOS> `` yes , '' added planchet , `` like the famous ass of buridan . <EOS>	79.93952002656275
<SOS> shall i knock ? '' <EOS>	87.8000677841567
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	89.59234868757478
<SOS> replied d'artagnan ; `` the light no longer burns in yonder window . '' <EOS>	66.20384482534948
<SOS> `` do you hear nothing ? '' <EOS>	72.55491937887265
<SOS> whispered planchet . <EOS>	110.17206984751533
<SOS> `` what is that noise ? '' <EOS>	66.5727126717483
<SOS> there came a sound like a whirlwind , at the same time two troops of horsemen , each composed of ten men , sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded d'artagnan and planchet . <EOS>	55.12716205466883
<SOS> `` heyday ! '' <EOS>	63.531849329668454
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse ; `` are you not mistaken ? <EOS>	55.06630358227636
<SOS> is it really for us that you mean your attack ? '' <EOS>	58.91460446297205
<SOS> `` here he is ! <EOS>	70.21217988039737
<SOS> we have him ! '' <EOS>	57.98471618936569
<SOS> cried the horsemen , rushing on d'artagnan with naked swords . <EOS>	62.18428936568017
<SOS> `` do n't let him escape ! '' <EOS>	108.46236078711938
<SOS> said a loud voice . <EOS>	44.854973541144034
<SOS> `` no , my lord ; be assured we shall not . '' <EOS>	59.01353892965203
<SOS> d'artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation . <EOS>	59.78715471485102
<SOS> `` halloo , gentlemen ! '' <EOS>	109.27642831647317
<SOS> he called out in his gascon accent , `` what do you want ? <EOS>	74.76491442955302
<SOS> what do you demand ? '' <EOS>	73.51581571137672
<SOS> `` that thou shalt soon know , '' shouted a chorus of horsemen . <EOS>	62.89580400739677
<SOS> `` stop , stop ! '' <EOS>	105.74254880980831
<SOS> cried he whom they had addressed as `` my lord ; '' `` 't is not his voice . '' <EOS>	52.34060004484292
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	78.25075947040187
<SOS> just so , gentlemen ! <EOS>	112.13125560814954
<SOS> pray , do people get into a passion at random at noisy ? <EOS>	72.51522920377913
<SOS> take care , for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up . '' <EOS>	59.72606887722755
<SOS> the chieftain of the party drew near . <EOS>	114.53252757279982
<SOS> `` what are you doing here ? '' <EOS>	57.163425056678605
<SOS> he asked in a lofty tone , as that of one accustomed to command . <EOS>	96.60618077268616
<SOS> `` and you what are you doing here ? '' <EOS>	83.15098479917695
<SOS> replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	91.6008312357649
<SOS> `` be civil , or i shall beat you ; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself , one insists on respect suitable to one 's rank . '' <EOS>	48.72415193604001
<SOS> `` you do n't choose to discover yourself , because you are the leader of an ambuscade , '' returned d'artagnan ; `` but with regard to myself , who am traveling quietly with my own servant , i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name . '' <EOS>	55.465911342968674
<SOS> `` enough ! <EOS>	83.92639486409308
<SOS> enough ! <EOS>	57.80490749777595
<SOS> what is your name ? '' <EOS>	73.60494624602882
<SOS> `` i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me , my lord , or my prince , as it may suit you best to be called , '' said our gascon , who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat . <EOS>	92.49800418329374
<SOS> `` do you know monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	74.68071020724729
<SOS> `` lieutenant in the king 's musketeers ? '' <EOS>	54.54028996817949
<SOS> said the voice ; `` you are monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	90.90047677794418
<SOS> `` i am . '' <EOS>	60.641271861346205
<SOS> `` then you came here to defend him ? '' <EOS>	56.32665895734263
<SOS> `` him ? <EOS>	57.2216104318604
<SOS> whom ? '' <EOS>	82.55223778131625
<SOS> `` the man we are seeking . '' <EOS>	102.57774103966773
<SOS> `` it seems , '' said d'artagnan , `` that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered , without suspecting it , into the kingdom of mysteries . '' <EOS>	79.16305438152719
<SOS> `` come , '' replied the same lofty tone , `` answer ! <EOS>	78.94474681532655
<SOS> are you waiting for him underneath these windows ? <EOS>	63.87146771638646
<SOS> did you come to noisy to defend him ? '' <EOS>	60.74411694218896
<SOS> `` i am waiting for no one , '' replied d'artagnan , who was beginning to be angry . <EOS>	83.6643326015268
<SOS> `` i propose to defend no one but myself , and i shall defend myself vigorously , i give you warning . '' <EOS>	55.35108534712319
<SOS> `` very well , '' said the voice ; `` go away from here and leave the place to us . '' <EOS>	86.5460770713424
<SOS> `` go away from here ! '' <EOS>	47.96994407113148
<SOS> said d'artagnan , whose purposes were in conflict with that order , `` that is not so easy , since i am on the point of falling , and my horse , too , through fatigue ; unless , indeed , you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood . '' <EOS>	86.80018876467597
<SOS> `` rascal ! '' <EOS>	69.94068179899214
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	94.0273771658524
<SOS> monsieur ! '' <EOS>	51.36085940749745
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` i beg you will have a care what you say ; for if you utter another word like that , be you marquis , duke , prince or king , i will thrust it down your throat ! <EOS>	107.60894162302196
<SOS> do you hear ? '' <EOS>	103.35120804550988
<SOS> `` well , well , '' rejoined the leader , `` there 's no doubt 't is a gascon who is speaking , and therefore not the man we are looking for . <EOS>	52.1555338796667
<SOS> our blow has failed for to night ; let us withdraw . <EOS>	89.34951304502059
<SOS> we shall meet again , master d'artagnan , '' continued the leader , raising his voice . <EOS>	77.45049202473169
<SOS> `` yes , but never with the same advantages , '' said d'artagnan , in a tone of raillery ; `` for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight . '' <EOS>	47.380191320461954
<SOS> `` very good , very good , '' said the voice . <EOS>	85.23527336861275
<SOS> `` en route , gentlemen . '' <EOS>	74.01017593505229
<SOS> and the troop , grumbling angrily , disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris . <EOS>	81.38031645571522
<SOS> d'artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive ; then , as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant , they sheathed their swords . <EOS>	72.07727767876678
<SOS> `` thou seest , simpleton , '' said d'artagnan to his servant , `` that they wished no harm to us . '' <EOS>	70.460339063944
<SOS> `` but to whom , then ? '' <EOS>	49.81870646654684
<SOS> `` i'faith ! <EOS>	58.97724170400827
<SOS> i neither know nor care . <EOS>	103.135918818216
<SOS> what i do care for now , is to make my way into the jesuits ' convent ; so to horse and let us knock at their door . <EOS>	89.42535502948897
<SOS> happen what will , the devil take them , they ca n't eat us . '' <EOS>	83.1905885367955
<SOS> and he mounted his horse . <EOS>	47.50666978114269
<SOS> planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse , which sank down . <EOS>	61.67909925398136
<SOS> `` hey ! <EOS>	91.98313156517477
<SOS> your honor ! '' <EOS>	117.05551777398381
<SOS> cried planchet , `` i 've a man behind me . '' <EOS>	83.77351269777301
<SOS> d'artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet 's horse . <EOS>	58.77060686812471
<SOS> `` 't is then the devil that pursues ! '' <EOS>	84.22481270509526
<SOS> he cried ; drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe . <EOS>	84.49710729263587
<SOS> `` no , no , dear d'artagnan , '' said the figure , `` 't is not the devil , 't is aramis ; gallop fast , planchet , and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left . '' <EOS>	115.01117758543832
<SOS> and planchet , with aramis behind him , set off at full gallop , followed by d'artagnan , who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream . <EOS>	64.28227784183368
<SOS> chapter ix . <EOS>	44.84801798890761
<SOS> the abbé d'herblay . <EOS>	61.69512804700921
<SOS> at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis , and stopped underneath the window which had light in it . <EOS>	117.60785373311481
<SOS> aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times . <EOS>	55.6003646090539
<SOS> immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it . <EOS>	66.37381129743788
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said aramis , `` if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you . '' <EOS>	61.08721953960339
<SOS> `` ah , '' said d'artagnan , `` is that the way you return to your apartment ? '' <EOS>	83.25666778805713
<SOS> `` after nine at night , pardieu ! '' <EOS>	57.731262799706975
<SOS> said aramis , `` the rule of the convent is very severe . '' <EOS>	90.16901940108836
<SOS> `` pardon me , my dear friend , '' said d'artagnan , `` i think you said 'pardieu ! ' '' <EOS>	78.56204144168778
<SOS> `` do you think so ? '' <EOS>	70.54774105813004
<SOS> said aramis , smiling ; `` it is possible . <EOS>	66.54295743812524
<SOS> you have no idea , my dear fellow , how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents , or what evil ways all these men of the church have , with whom i am obliged to live . <EOS>	41.32449482264379
<SOS> but will you not go up ? '' <EOS>	95.36170118449627
<SOS> `` pass on before me , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	39.488959709449134
<SOS> `` as the late cardinal used to say to the late king , 'only to show you the way , sire . ' '' <EOS>	82.69137120598484
<SOS> and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant . <EOS>	71.30769175674037
<SOS> d'artagnan followed , but less nimbly , showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed . <EOS>	91.41431329848723
<SOS> `` i beg your pardon , '' said aramis , noticing his awkwardness ; `` if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener 's ladder ; but for me alone this is good enough . '' <EOS>	68.9705696636314
<SOS> `` sir , '' said planchet when he saw d'artagnan on the summit of the ladder , `` this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you ; in case of necessity i might also climb up , but my two horses can not mount the ladder . '' <EOS>	113.90636462977207
<SOS> `` take them to yonder shed , my friend , '' said aramis , pointing to a low building on the plain ; `` there you will find hay and straw for them ; then come back here and clap your hands three times , and we will give you wine and food . <EOS>	58.54802516746939
<SOS> marry , forsooth , people do n't die of hunger here . '' <EOS>	87.10651646929072
<SOS> and aramis , drawing in the ladder , closed the window . <EOS>	95.00601078272582
<SOS> d'artagnan then looked around attentively . <EOS>	80.03510658467256
<SOS> never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant . <EOS>	112.61108881953606
<SOS> at each corner were arranged trophies , presenting to view swords of all sorts , and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine , the cardinal de richelieu , the cardinal de la valette , and the archbishop of bordeaux . <EOS>	55.13574044298987
<SOS> exteriorly , nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé . <EOS>	77.31360338753535
<SOS> the hangings were of damask , the carpets from alencon , and the bed , especially , had more the look of a fine lady 's couch , with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane , than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification . <EOS>	92.09209332819457
<SOS> `` you are examining my den , '' said aramis . <EOS>	38.81680757923055
<SOS> `` ah , my dear fellow , excuse me ; i am lodged like a chartreux . <EOS>	67.02013143619241
<SOS> but what are you looking for ? '' <EOS>	106.51991332388438
<SOS> `` i am looking for the person who let down the ladder . <EOS>	69.54043059394965
<SOS> i see no one and yet the ladder did n't come down of itself . '' <EOS>	68.41051687441775
<SOS> `` no , it is bazin . '' <EOS>	62.87201118600817
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	58.63138200497972
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	110.18265777306199
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.29808653757163
<SOS> `` but , '' continued aramis , `` bazin is a well trained servant , and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired . <EOS>	70.82713129641031
<SOS> sit down , my dear friend , and let us talk . '' <EOS>	44.39212813037503
<SOS> and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair , in which d'artagnan stretched himself out . <EOS>	60.50134299062891
<SOS> `` in the first place , you will sup with me , will you not ? '' <EOS>	56.54406677787229
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	80.20197484181628
<SOS> `` yes , if you really wish it , '' said d'artagnan , `` and even with great pleasure , i confess ; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite . '' <EOS>	70.9100374287064
<SOS> `` ah , my poor friend ! '' <EOS>	72.04513984835707
<SOS> said aramis , `` you will find meagre fare ; you were not expected . '' <EOS>	52.2877005445431
<SOS> `` am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur ? '' <EOS>	52.50867858935886
<SOS> `` oh , let us hope , '' said aramis , `` that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers . <EOS>	62.299078330534684
<SOS> bazin , my friend , come here . '' <EOS>	69.54163948903225
<SOS> the door opened and bazin entered ; on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair . <EOS>	48.344597389534684
<SOS> `` my dear bazin , '' said d'artagnan , `` i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church ! '' <EOS>	100.00747743759649
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied bazin , `` i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause . '' <EOS>	68.81787396697578
<SOS> `` so far well , '' said aramis ; `` we are dying of hunger . <EOS>	73.95106963689338
<SOS> serve us up the best supper you can , and especially give us some good wine . '' <EOS>	119.74990616846861
<SOS> bazin bowed low , sighed , and left the room . <EOS>	80.03305733483971
<SOS> `` now we are alone , dear aramis , '' said d'artagnan , `` tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet 's horse . '' <EOS>	96.41799178909731
<SOS> `` i'faith ! '' <EOS>	102.86559677862742
<SOS> answered aramis , `` as you see , from heaven . '' <EOS>	84.98009113057674
<SOS> `` from heaven , '' replied d'artagnan , shaking his head ; `` you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there . '' <EOS>	104.0601591133979
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said aramis , with a look of imbecility on his face which d'artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers , `` if i did not come from heaven , at least i was leaving paradise , which is almost the same . '' <EOS>	82.6842146020988
<SOS> `` here , then , is a puzzle for the learned , '' observed d'artagnan , `` until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise ; some place it on mount ararat , others between the rivers tigris and euphrates ; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it , while it was actually very near . <EOS>	73.92845460771456
<SOS> paradise is at noisy le sec , upon the site of the archbishop 's chateau . <EOS>	80.16010220996414
<SOS> people do not go out from it by the door , but by the window ; one does n't descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle , but by the branches of a lime tree ; and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac . '' <EOS>	116.46534870503736
<SOS> aramis burst into a fit of laughter . <EOS>	50.578852402497404
<SOS> `` you were always a merry companion , my dear d'artagnan , '' he said , `` and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you . <EOS>	66.75160215565916
<SOS> yes , there is something in what you say ; nevertheless , do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love . '' <EOS>	66.4350123174012
<SOS> `` a plague o n't ! <EOS>	57.76244539348326
<SOS> i shall not do so . <EOS>	96.79317293163332
<SOS> after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse , you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy ! '' <EOS>	81.9717717740156
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied aramis , with an absent air ; `` yes , that poor duchess ! <EOS>	60.203271467190746
<SOS> i once loved her much , and to do her justice , she was very useful to us . <EOS>	66.54221795197238
<SOS> eventually she was obliged to leave france . <EOS>	61.894225018100535
<SOS> he was a relentless enemy , that damned cardinal , '' continued aramis , glancing at the portrait of the old minister . <EOS>	82.83885877190178
<SOS> `` he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty ! <EOS>	77.86848539476989
<SOS> i have heard that she met with a strange adventure in i do n't know what village , with i do n't know what curé , of whom she asked hospitality and who , having but one chamber , and taking her for a cavalier , offered to share it with her . <EOS>	44.23202310604357
<SOS> for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man , that dear marie ; i know only one other woman who can do it as well . <EOS>	58.317371723937725
<SOS> so they made this song about her : ' laboissiere , dis moi . ' <EOS>	70.5501805169054
<SOS> you know it , do n't you ? '' <EOS>	59.27795068014366
<SOS> `` no , sing it , please . '' <EOS>	91.60184411188894
<SOS> aramis immediately complied , and sang the song in a very lively manner . <EOS>	72.6419149154395
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	61.272411531426044
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` you sing charmingly , dear aramis . <EOS>	80.27527053714235
<SOS> i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice . '' <EOS>	73.46647411862801
<SOS> `` my dear d'artagnan , '' replied aramis , `` you understand , when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could ; now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can . <EOS>	77.46238125618319

<SOS> `` which the duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville ? '' <EOS>	63.6712320537545
<SOS> `` have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville ? <EOS>	82.22876989914018
<SOS> little flirtations , perhaps , and that 's all . <EOS>	81.88626195029462
<SOS> no , i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse ; did you see her after her return from brussels , after the king 's death ? '' <EOS>	59.076495612992055
<SOS> `` yes , she is still beautiful . '' <EOS>	66.41856194231728
<SOS> `` yes , '' said aramis , `` i saw her also at that time . <EOS>	74.04508737288378
<SOS> i gave her good advice , by which she did not profit . <EOS>	41.46151245802719
<SOS> i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria . <EOS>	73.33438862023061
<SOS> she would n't believe me , saying that she knew anne of austria , who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb . <EOS>	60.55266690376893
<SOS> after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort ; and the 'coxcomb ' arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse . '' <EOS>	71.30727948283982
<SOS> `` you know , '' resumed d'artagnan , `` that she has had leave to return to france ? '' <EOS>	57.0467905397817
<SOS> `` yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another . '' <EOS>	65.27489167652597
<SOS> `` oh , but this time perhaps she will follow your advice . '' <EOS>	85.10958578343548
<SOS> `` oh , this time , '' returned aramis , `` i have n't seen her ; she is much changed . '' <EOS>	72.62273726129645
<SOS> `` in that respect unlike you , my dear aramis , for you are still the same ; you have still your beautiful dark hair , still your elegant figure , still your feminine hands , which are admirably suited to a prelate . '' <EOS>	99.885422671933
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied aramis , `` i am extremely careful of my appearance . <EOS>	93.64199514798288
<SOS> do you know that i am growing old ? <EOS>	46.160297205554734
<SOS> i am nearly thirty seven . '' <EOS>	91.45711995602899
<SOS> `` mind , aramis '' d'artagnan smiled as he spoke `` since we are together again , let us agree on one point : what age shall we be in future ? '' <EOS>	70.71682389666499
<SOS> `` how ? '' <EOS>	47.13343499713141
<SOS> `` formerly i was your junior by two or three years , and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old . '' <EOS>	74.38903986016658
<SOS> `` indeed ! <EOS>	79.94513817290647
<SOS> then 't is i who am mistaken , for you have always been a good chronologist . <EOS>	93.28557164102895
<SOS> by your reckoning i must be forty three at least . <EOS>	86.46092129452839
<SOS> the devil i am ! <EOS>	62.182697768278764
<SOS> do n't let it out at the hotel rambouillet ; it would ruin me , '' replied the abbé . <EOS>	46.2370633035301
<SOS> `` do n't be afraid , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	64.99494839918853
<SOS> `` i never go there . '' <EOS>	59.19166155957847
<SOS> `` why , what in the world , '' cried aramis , `` is that animal bazin doing ? <EOS>	88.68836932501496
<SOS> bazin ! <EOS>	49.29148008540591
<SOS> hurry up there , you rascal ; we are mad with hunger and thirst ! '' <EOS>	102.98926788702029
<SOS> bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand . <EOS>	47.344753234500814
<SOS> `` at last , '' said aramis , `` we are ready , are we ? '' <EOS>	72.80670919935443
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , quite ready , '' said bazin ; `` but it took me some time to bring up all the `` `` because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle 's robe , and spend all your time reading your breviary . <EOS>	46.79033063216504
<SOS> but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword , i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it . '' <EOS>	40.94672378920931
<SOS> bazin , scandalized , made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand . <EOS>	99.76097522915727
<SOS> d'artagnan , more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d'herblay , which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis , remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend . <EOS>	86.41496325275638
<SOS> bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things , gilded , perfumed , appetizing , that d'artagnan was quite overcome . <EOS>	82.63763056911463
<SOS> `` but you expected some one then ? '' <EOS>	85.38871473801082
<SOS> asked the officer . <EOS>	64.83309077623261
<SOS> `` oh , '' said aramis , `` i always try to be prepared ; and then i knew you were seeking me . '' <EOS>	62.21288637616982
<SOS> `` from whom ? '' <EOS>	69.05194540665036
<SOS> `` from master bazin , to be sure ; he took you for the devil , my dear fellow , and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers . '' <EOS>	65.47989262841247
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur ! '' <EOS>	79.82596436264657
<SOS> said bazin , clasping his hands supplicatingly . <EOS>	92.32949765288032
<SOS> `` come , no hypocrisy ! <EOS>	43.452094825315115
<SOS> you know that i do n't like it . <EOS>	57.53228304908104
<SOS> you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread , a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet , who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands . '' <EOS>	77.38772966221498
<SOS> planchet , in fact , had bedded and fed his horses , and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon . <EOS>	53.81320990918524
<SOS> bazin obeyed , fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet , who then went satisfied to his shed . <EOS>	62.79025301392686
<SOS> `` now to supper , '' said aramis . <EOS>	54.597446129108135
<SOS> the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls , partridges and hams with admirable skill . <EOS>	97.45320020178144
<SOS> `` the deuce ! '' <EOS>	46.346689849570794
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` do you live in this way always ? '' <EOS>	50.02663886188897
<SOS> `` yes , pretty well . <EOS>	50.18631396277512
<SOS> the coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres , on account of my health ; then i have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with lafollone you know the man i mean ? <EOS>	96.82648499594882
<SOS> the friend of the cardinal , and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be , 'good lord , do me the favor to cause me to digest what i have eaten . ' '' <EOS>	90.89986922549072
<SOS> `` nevertheless he died of indigestion , in spite of his grace , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	77.05224080408003
<SOS> `` what can you expect ? '' <EOS>	81.23782577998166
<SOS> replied aramis , in a tone of resignation . <EOS>	96.58084724013317
<SOS> `` every man that 's born must fulfil his destiny . '' <EOS>	58.74546914897816
<SOS> `` if it be not an indelicate question , '' resumed d'artagnan , `` have you grown rich ? '' <EOS>	91.05890622686294
<SOS> `` oh , heaven ! <EOS>	84.974935001274
<SOS> no . <EOS>	62.916902508363734
<SOS> i make about twelve thousand francs a year , without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me . '' <EOS>	77.87511336294027
<SOS> `` and how do you make your twelve thousand francs ? <EOS>	54.158836930587775
<SOS> by your poems ? '' <EOS>	96.43676810146756
<SOS> `` no , i have given up poetry , except now and then to write a drinking song , some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram ; i compose sermons , my friend . '' <EOS>	45.83861023141163
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	100.76944868074456
<SOS> sermons ? <EOS>	101.19969149870123
<SOS> do you preach them ? '' <EOS>	91.16748686525574
<SOS> `` no ; i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators . '' <EOS>	113.1151191552169
<SOS> `` ah , indeed ! <EOS>	75.07985035254525
<SOS> and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself ? '' <EOS>	70.14167228665838
<SOS> `` i should , my dear d'artagnan , have been so , but nature said 'no . ' <EOS>	61.49585312718691
<SOS> when i am in the pulpit , if by chance a pretty woman looks at me , i look at her again : if she smiles , i smile too . <EOS>	97.49546838782518
<SOS> then i speak at random ; instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise . <EOS>	70.37724080633517
<SOS> an event took place in the church of st. louis au marais . <EOS>	74.06135350853818
<SOS> a gentleman laughed in my face . <EOS>	63.5957182256004
<SOS> i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool ; the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with , but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present , so that my foe was pelted instead of me . <EOS>	49.267746245730855
<SOS> 't is true that he came the next morning to my house , thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés . '' <EOS>	108.0103323793792
<SOS> `` and what was the end of the affair ? '' <EOS>	43.333629935715365
<SOS> `` we met in the place royale egad ! <EOS>	60.722444227833705

<SOS> `` was i not your second ? '' <EOS>	82.13421953209445

<SOS> `` you were ; you know how i settled the matter . '' <EOS>	60.0899635375208

<SOS> 't is enough to kill the body , without killing the soul . '' <EOS>	56.891980269084776
<SOS> bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered . <EOS>	64.06290947942362
<SOS> `` bazin , my friend , '' said aramis , `` you do n't seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror , and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation . <EOS>	69.86435844938903
<SOS> you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw . <EOS>	50.959055949101646
<SOS> besides , my friend d'artagnan has something to say to me privately , have you not , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	110.21052559381239
<SOS> d'artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired , after placing on the table the spanish wine . <EOS>	54.38725194514185
<SOS> the two friends , left alone , remained silent , face to face . <EOS>	49.26780261710497
<SOS> aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion ; d'artagnan , to be preparing his exordium . <EOS>	92.61320462969726
<SOS> each of them , when the other was not looking , hazarded a sly glance . <EOS>	62.87049709537512
<SOS> it was aramis who broke the silence . <EOS>	56.49709400598963
<SOS> `` what are you thinking of , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	54.01559945896198
<SOS> he began . <EOS>	81.69051053874605
<SOS> `` i was thinking , my dear old friend , that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church , and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer . '' <EOS>	84.97068526167418
<SOS> `` 't is true ; man , as you know , '' said aramis , `` is a strange animal , made up of contradictions . <EOS>	77.58135003680243
<SOS> since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles . '' <EOS>	42.20548333331099
<SOS> `` that is apparent in your surroundings ; you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste . <EOS>	120.66660927121809

<SOS> `` i i fence as well as you did in the old time better still , perhaps ; i do nothing else all day . '' <EOS>	91.45811151923522
<SOS> `` and with whom ? '' <EOS>	46.67276756470545
<SOS> `` with an excellent master at arms that we have here . '' <EOS>	59.91580518854635
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	68.12799416037015

<SOS> `` yes , here , in this convent , my dear fellow . <EOS>	50.5135405601072
<SOS> there is everything in a jesuit convent . '' <EOS>	57.65396837223157
<SOS> `` then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you , instead of at the head of twenty men ? '' <EOS>	54.54730805687383
<SOS> `` undoubtedly , '' said aramis , `` and even at the head of his twenty men , if i could have drawn without being recognized . '' <EOS>	87.82240781374165
<SOS> `` god pardon me ! '' <EOS>	73.02375860774868
<SOS> said d'artagnan to himself , `` i believe he has become more gascon than i am ! '' <EOS>	61.08506435090653
<SOS> then aloud : `` well , my dear aramis , do you ask me why i came to seek you ? '' <EOS>	67.48816885930177
<SOS> `` no , i have not asked you that , '' said aramis , with his subtle manner ; `` but i have expected you to tell me . '' <EOS>	106.46514722344816
<SOS> `` well , i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please , prince though he is . '' <EOS>	80.6994981332457

<SOS> `` of which i invite you to take advantage , my friend . <EOS>	56.6027143168924

<SOS> `` well , my friend , i bring you the means of becoming rich , powerful , and free to do whatever you wish . '' <EOS>	68.88288266464066
<SOS> the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis 's face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain ; but quick as it was , it did not escape d'artagnan 's observation . <EOS>	70.50746903592523
<SOS> `` speak on , '' said aramis . <EOS>	116.27780181308262

<SOS> `` no , '' aramis replied . <EOS>	39.933639657455096

<SOS> `` my first impressions were favorable to the minister ; i said to myself that a minister is never loved , but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared , which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved `` d'artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim . <EOS>	84.90465828205595
<SOS> `` this , then , '' continued aramis , `` was my first opinion ; but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment , but to ask the opinion of others , i have inquired eh ! <EOS>	69.93083970006309

<SOS> `` to which he adds that of bracieux , an estate which has been a barony , by my troth . '' <EOS>	70.8376917785055

<SOS> `` so , '' d'artagnan resumed , `` you will not become a partisan of mazarin 's ? '' <EOS>	44.023308364611694

<SOS> and d'artagnan poured out a glass of wine . <EOS>	55.50341609076225
<SOS> `` to old times , '' he said . <EOS>	54.74431115027516

<SOS> `` oh , i ca n't let you go so ! <EOS>	70.80763911810466
<SOS> i will go with you . '' <EOS>	82.55955552634236
<SOS> and he took his sword and cloak . <EOS>	76.84184248897733
<SOS> `` he wants to be sure that i go away , '' said d'artagnan to himself . <EOS>	109.7249075083911
<SOS> aramis whistled for bazin , but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber , and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him . <EOS>	82.39730787046726
<SOS> bazin stretched his arms , rubbed his eyes , and tried to go to sleep again . <EOS>	75.25287282263837
<SOS> `` come , come , sleepy head ; quick , the ladder ! '' <EOS>	70.02453761418346

<SOS> `` the other one , the gardener 's . <EOS>	55.24275601781772
<SOS> did n't you see that monsieur d'artagnan mounted with difficulty ? <EOS>	55.80093252892718
<SOS> it will be even more difficult to descend . '' <EOS>	79.11619088929754
<SOS> d'artagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily , when an idea came into his head which silenced him . <EOS>	59.892642228895646
<SOS> bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder . <EOS>	111.77588684544428
<SOS> presently a good , solid , wooden ladder was placed against the window . <EOS>	101.50375490803087
<SOS> `` now then , '' said d'artagnan , `` this is something like ; this is a means of communication . <EOS>	77.62314214812952
<SOS> a woman could go up a ladder like that . '' <EOS>	104.33551980616366
<SOS> aramis 's searching look seemed to seek his friend 's thought even at the bottom of his heart , but d'artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity . <EOS>	69.7734617929001
<SOS> besides , at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent . <EOS>	42.897262647123014
<SOS> in a moment he was on the ground . <EOS>	78.01147575757487
<SOS> bazin remained at the window . <EOS>	94.20860389417466
<SOS> `` stay there , '' said aramis ; `` i shall return immediately . '' <EOS>	56.968864563261015
<SOS> the two friends went toward the shed . <EOS>	62.03367674964969
<SOS> at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses . <EOS>	103.32701110985955
<SOS> `` that is good to see , '' said aramis . <EOS>	106.23687920941657
<SOS> `` there is a servant active and vigilant , not like that lazy fellow bazin , who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church . <EOS>	75.49252343303546
<SOS> follow us , planchet ; we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village . '' <EOS>	55.82345870359844
<SOS> they traversed the width of the village , talking of indifferent things , then as they reached the last houses : `` go , then , dear friend , '' said aramis , `` follow your own career . <EOS>	86.902868885109
<SOS> fortune lavishes her smiles upon you ; do not let her flee from your embrace . <EOS>	92.44774569132822
<SOS> as for me , i remain in my humility and indolence . <EOS>	63.06744264718291
<SOS> adieu ! '' <EOS>	117.21390326115736
<SOS> `` thus 't is quite decided , '' said d'artagnan , `` that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you ? '' <EOS>	103.63331564152189
<SOS> `` on the contrary , it would tempt me were i any other man , '' rejoined aramis ; `` but i repeat , i am made up of contradictions . <EOS>	60.254529321451855
<SOS> what i hate to day i adore to morrow , and vice versa . <EOS>	52.348883301848765
<SOS> you see that i can not , like you , for instance , settle on any fixed plan . '' <EOS>	57.91303787572574
<SOS> `` thou liest , subtile one , '' said d'artagnan to himself . <EOS>	89.59487420628547
<SOS> `` thou alone , on the contrary , knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily . '' <EOS>	98.65577621670035
<SOS> the friends embraced . <EOS>	65.8747717364041
<SOS> they descended into the plain by the ladder . <EOS>	72.33763535370423
<SOS> planchet met them hard by the shed . <EOS>	58.36436680526422
<SOS> d'artagnan jumped into the saddle , then the old companions in arms again shook hands . <EOS>	56.273022986201475
<SOS> d'artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris . <EOS>	51.33991043730084
<SOS> but after he had gone about two hundred steps d'artagnan stopped short , alighted , threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle . <EOS>	85.24934572150116
<SOS> `` what 's the matter ? '' <EOS>	56.72182595629358
<SOS> asked planchet . <EOS>	66.79225335965288
<SOS> `` this is the matter : be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe . <EOS>	57.96446838120313
<SOS> stand here , do n't stir , turn your back to the road and wait for me . '' <EOS>	112.55636704131638
<SOS> having thus spoken , d'artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village . <EOS>	81.14305513405233
<SOS> he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits , an open space surrounded by a hedge . <EOS>	95.9278301302343
<SOS> the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road . <EOS>	87.98630716477919
<SOS> he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it ; in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place , he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone . <EOS>	81.66542412494752
<SOS> in truth , in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers . <EOS>	62.62437489697801
<SOS> close to the hedge the steps stopped . <EOS>	69.0329622798294
<SOS> d'artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge . <EOS>	73.87066186125274
<SOS> two men , to the astonishment of d'artagnan , appeared shortly ; soon , however , his surprise vanished , for he heard the murmurs of a soft , harmonious voice ; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier . <EOS>	58.28919476836223
<SOS> `` calm yourself , dear rene , '' said the soft voice , `` the same thing will never happen again . <EOS>	65.70721018407032
<SOS> i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet . '' <EOS>	92.40133909480414
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	88.44109143882193
<SOS> answered another voice , which d'artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis . <EOS>	65.01289166878409
<SOS> `` i swear to you , princess , that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized `` `` yes , yes ! <EOS>	66.86498215612438
<SOS> i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world , but you do not belong to me alone ; you belong to all our party . <EOS>	75.67591554194713
<SOS> be prudent ! <EOS>	77.60674176217918
<SOS> sensible ! '' <EOS>	81.40549018246008
<SOS> `` i always obey , madame , when i am commanded by so gentle a voice . '' <EOS>	88.8601355807499
<SOS> he kissed her hand tenderly . <EOS>	48.95498236568343
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	88.71247450609238
<SOS> exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice . <EOS>	47.83623807764683
<SOS> `` what 's the matter ? '' <EOS>	47.902879271662755
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	44.70495562037629
<SOS> `` do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat ? '' <EOS>	69.42163286843538
<SOS> aramis rushed after the fugitive hat . <EOS>	120.06573117063778
<SOS> d'artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick , where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier . <EOS>	95.10925279845657
<SOS> at that instant , the moon , inquisitive , perhaps , like d'artagnan , came from behind a cloud and by her light d'artagnan recognized the large blue eyes , the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville . <EOS>	95.26811307016935
<SOS> aramis returned , laughing , one hat on his head and the other in his hand ; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent . <EOS>	47.993552874882546
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	90.71698532232973
<SOS> said d'artagnan , rising and brushing his knees ; `` now i have thee thou art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville . '' <EOS>	48.43434993670525
<SOS> chapter x. monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds . <EOS>	56.61451519990572
<SOS> thanks to what aramis had told him , d'artagnan , who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon , was now aware that he styled himself , from his estate , de bracieux ; and that he was , on account of this estate , engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon . <EOS>	59.4220753674929
<SOS> it was , then , in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate . <EOS>	58.64264465836492
<SOS> his itinerary was promptly determined : he would go to dammartin , from which place two roads diverge , one toward soissons , the other toward compiegne ; there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained . <EOS>	68.3542104654743
<SOS> planchet , who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade , declared that he would follow d'artagnan even to the end of the world , either by the road to the right or by that to the left ; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening , for greater security to himself . <EOS>	80.9740236535571
<SOS> d'artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife , so that she might not be anxious about him , but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was , while he , planchet , remembering her incontinence of tongue , would die of anxiety if she did know . <EOS>	46.9029386604846
<SOS> this reasoning seemed to d'artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted ; and about eight o'clock in the evening , the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets , he left the hotel de la chevrette , and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate . <EOS>	70.9814474616209
<SOS> at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin , but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed . <EOS>	52.64980894944682
<SOS> the next morning d'artagnan summoned the host , one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer . <EOS>	92.40726421432636
<SOS> d'artagnan , however , gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take , and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey . <EOS>	61.953594795805635
<SOS> at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast . <EOS>	52.38206818172416
<SOS> his host here was a good fellow from picardy , who gave him all the information he needed . <EOS>	67.9081372775223
<SOS> the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets . <EOS>	56.310638309061076
<SOS> d'artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets , having gone thither with the court on several occasions ; for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence . <EOS>	71.6459579185961
<SOS> he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d'or . <EOS>	85.82392264080553
<SOS> there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant , but that porthos was not at bracieux . <EOS>	70.52361529677567
<SOS> porthos had , in fact , been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property , which adjoined his own , and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension , he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others . <EOS>	72.88687898660375
<SOS> he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds , and resided on his new estate . <EOS>	46.33951884723547
<SOS> the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day ; the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest . <EOS>	61.06092285728743
<SOS> it is true they might have taken others , but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet , as we have seen , had no liking for forests after dark . <EOS>	52.77937709935969
<SOS> there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach . <EOS>	97.13069217857036
<SOS> accordingly , d'artagnan , on awaking , found his breakfast waiting for him . <EOS>	51.00005943193707
<SOS> it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d'artagnan . <EOS>	60.3495580227463
<SOS> it was nearly eight o'clock when they set out again . <EOS>	86.53553832722578
<SOS> their course was clearly defined : they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right . <EOS>	89.67401380378239
<SOS> the morning was beautiful , and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades , like curtains of golden gauze . <EOS>	61.69388479714769
<SOS> in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage , and the stems of two old oak trees , the refuge of the squirrel , startled by the travelers , were in deep shadow . <EOS>	85.46102572937076
<SOS> there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs , flowers and leaves , which delighted the heart . <EOS>	58.105359977047144
<SOS> d'artagnan , sick of the closeness of paris , thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another , he ought to be very happy in such a paradise ; then he shook his head , saying , `` if i were porthos and d'artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him , i know what i should say to it . '' <EOS>	52.95058274373899
<SOS> as to planchet , he thought of little or nothing , but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master 's company . <EOS>	51.14606015125251
<SOS> at the extremity of the wood d'artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him , and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle . <EOS>	122.18637605200185
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	67.92768745996833
<SOS> oh ! '' <EOS>	108.0966064351739
<SOS> he said , `` i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans . <EOS>	58.60523995485863
<SOS> can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville ? '' <EOS>	47.21144513266834
<SOS> `` faith ! '' <EOS>	112.34330206556803
<SOS> exclaimed planchet , `` here 's land in good condition ; if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy . '' <EOS>	54.9427619154844
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	65.60042172761437
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` do n't call him porthos , nor even vallon ; call him de bracieux or de pierrefonds ; thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise . '' <EOS>	55.35574644472423
<SOS> as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye , d'artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt ; the towers , though solid and as if built yesterday , were open and broken . <EOS>	62.10389992611718
<SOS> one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet . <EOS>	95.51877370753681
<SOS> on arriving at the extremity of the castle d'artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley , in which , at the foot of a charming little lake , stood several scattered houses , which , humble in their aspect , and covered , some with tiles , others with thatch , seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau , built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv. , and surmounted by four stately , gilded weather cocks . <EOS>	62.11833988948378
<SOS> d'artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos 's pleasant dwelling place . <EOS>	109.77593056356386
<SOS> the road led straight up to the chateau which , compared to its ancestor on the hill , was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the duc d'enghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of charles vii . <EOS>	93.96458096928906
<SOS> d'artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road , followed by planchet at the same pace . <EOS>	93.27441110650959
<SOS> in ten minutes d'artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate , the points and crossed bars of which were gilt . <EOS>	58.07619912832759
<SOS> in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman , dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate , riding on a tall horse . <EOS>	111.54414716384164
<SOS> on his right hand and his left were two footmen , with the seams of their dresses laced . <EOS>	45.30156887553293
<SOS> a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord . <EOS>	51.69173561947674
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	58.53002644139901
<SOS> said d'artagnan to himself , `` can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds ? <EOS>	57.66515806446789
<SOS> well a day ! <EOS>	95.17978142295263
<SOS> how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos ! '' <EOS>	96.07615307689353
<SOS> `` this can not be monsieur porthos , '' observed planchet replying , as it were , to his master 's thoughts . <EOS>	56.058240295311926
<SOS> `` monsieur porthos was six feet high ; this man is scarcely five . '' <EOS>	46.62524602178378
<SOS> `` nevertheless , '' said d'artagnan , `` the people are bowing very low to this person . '' <EOS>	114.14999121508528
<SOS> as he spoke , he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets . <EOS>	71.60411803641036
<SOS> as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual . <EOS>	62.022574201627435
<SOS> `` jesu ! '' <EOS>	86.72887410785358
<SOS> cried planchet , `` can it be ? '' <EOS>	43.320599051343414
<SOS> at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air , and the two travelers could see , displayed in all their brilliancy , the large eyes , the vermilion visage , and the eloquent smile of mousqueton . <EOS>	80.60409067287098
<SOS> it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton , as fat as a pig , rolling about with rude health , puffed out with good living , who , recognizing d'artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin , slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off , so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun , which eclipsed the former luminary . <EOS>	80.04138205299593
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! <EOS>	62.45177890197719
<SOS> monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	91.30842008626125
<SOS> cried mousqueton , his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy ; `` monsieur d'artagnan ! <EOS>	75.54934468366636
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	71.82978233010263
<SOS> what joy for my lord and master , du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds ! '' <EOS>	52.62748558414174
<SOS> `` thou good mousqueton ! <EOS>	79.70781404638204
<SOS> where is thy master ? '' <EOS>	93.74024159367393
<SOS> `` you stand upon his property ! '' <EOS>	50.21768366862805
<SOS> `` but how handsome thou art how fat ! <EOS>	56.88313215342651
<SOS> thou hast prospered and grown stout ! '' <EOS>	98.21412053441023
<SOS> and d'artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one . <EOS>	67.5843415001469
<SOS> `` hey , yes , thank god , i am pretty well , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	78.38394200053764
<SOS> `` but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet ? '' <EOS>	69.59189410175655
<SOS> `` how , my friend planchet ? <EOS>	99.4388237091053
<SOS> planchet art thou there ? '' <EOS>	80.00930224773455
<SOS> cried mousqueton , with open arms and eyes full of tears . <EOS>	53.8107917305215
<SOS> `` my very self , '' replied planchet ; `` but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud . '' <EOS>	66.86800450535736
<SOS> `` proud toward an old friend ? <EOS>	57.66514106996275
<SOS> never , planchet ! <EOS>	92.55386648890298
<SOS> thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well . '' <EOS>	46.179811887370555
<SOS> `` so far so well , '' answered planchet , alighting , and extending his arms to mousqueton , the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise , so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton . <EOS>	69.40622345897978
<SOS> `` and now , sir , '' resumed mousqueton , when he had rid himself of planchet , who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend 's fat back , `` now , sir , allow me to leave you , for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself ; he would never forgive me for not having preceded you . '' <EOS>	44.59979446988334
<SOS> `` this dear friend , '' said d'artagnan , carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one , `` then he has not forgotten me ? '' <EOS>	90.77363583477953
<SOS> `` forgotten he ! '' <EOS>	89.71922663730955
<SOS> cried mousqueton ; `` there 's not a day , sir , that we do n't expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion , or of monsieur de bassompierre . '' <EOS>	91.14246459226999
<SOS> on d'artagnan 's lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life 's disillusions . <EOS>	69.30249389456287
<SOS> `` and you fellows , '' resumed mousqueton , `` stay near monsieur le comte d'artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit . '' <EOS>	75.91380746322002
<SOS> and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop . <EOS>	84.67826796792677
<SOS> `` ah , there ! <EOS>	108.571049925184
<SOS> there 's something promising , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	85.11928741441793
<SOS> `` no mysteries , no cloak to hide one 's self in , no cunning policy here ; people laugh outright , they weep for joy here . <EOS>	66.30682566387748
<SOS> i see nothing but faces a yard broad ; in short , it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb , and that the trees , instead of leaves and flowers , are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days . '' <EOS>	89.54475777273949
<SOS> `` as for me , '' said planchet , `` i seem to smell , from this place , even , a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat , and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge , hailing our approach . <EOS>	83.05161398985149
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	78.7449578310253
<SOS> sir , what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have , when he was so fond of eating and drinking , even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos ! '' <EOS>	95.67675988768069
<SOS> `` say no more ! '' <EOS>	52.40803208250155
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	112.66585364418039
<SOS> `` if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost ; for a man so well off will never change his happy condition , and i shall fail with him , as i have already done with aramis . '' <EOS>	87.77117717445991
<SOS> chapter xi . <EOS>	65.88751298773714
<SOS> wealth does not necessarily produce happiness . <EOS>	113.25308437159454
<SOS> d'artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau . <EOS>	55.508277864002956
<SOS> he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps . <EOS>	61.91590136662161
<SOS> let us do justice to d'artagnan . <EOS>	86.9979086439229
<SOS> independently of every selfish wish , his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor , which recalled to him a good and brave man . <EOS>	45.58712938080166
<SOS> he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms ; the whole body of servants , arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance , looked on with humble curiosity . <EOS>	78.6574591150384
<SOS> mousqueton , at the head of them , wiped his eyes . <EOS>	75.28984847282035
<SOS> porthos linked his arm in that of his friend . <EOS>	68.836180881075
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	83.03074084585626
<SOS> how delightful to see you again , dear friend ! '' <EOS>	65.15689727109961
<SOS> he cried , in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass , `` you 've not then forgotten me ? '' <EOS>	106.35166429504275
<SOS> `` forget you ! <EOS>	48.40036726575789
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	52.66069006691421
<SOS> dear du vallon , does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth , one 's dearest friends , the dangers we have dared together ? <EOS>	54.99445786013042
<SOS> on the contrary , there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory . '' <EOS>	80.2786900272091
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said porthos , trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone . <EOS>	76.49704883640135
<SOS> `` yes , we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel . '' <EOS>	89.34259364815388
<SOS> and he heaved a sigh . <EOS>	49.266969851080376
<SOS> `` under any circumstances , '' he resumed , `` you are welcome , my dear friend ; you will help me to recover my spirits ; to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain , which is a superb tract of land , or pursue the deer in my woods , which are magnificent . <EOS>	82.15177926907077
<SOS> i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county , and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around . '' <EOS>	111.35044975236278
<SOS> and porthos heaved another sigh . <EOS>	77.3148135548348
<SOS> `` but , first , '' interposed d'artagnan , `` you must present me to madame du vallon . '' <EOS>	71.5581360966538
<SOS> a third sigh from porthos . <EOS>	92.16154910280181
<SOS> `` i lost madame du vallon two years ago , '' he said , `` and you find me still in affliction on that account . <EOS>	89.7329725856098
<SOS> that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil , and came to my estate , bracieux . <EOS>	52.53700481455026
<SOS> poor madame du vallon ! <EOS>	52.02934555696143
<SOS> her temper was uncertain , but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes . '' <EOS>	92.04038792468128
<SOS> `` so you are free now , and rich ? '' <EOS>	73.94824665064996
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	53.75869607674018
<SOS> groaned porthos , `` i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year . <EOS>	95.15615201720429
<SOS> let us go to breakfast . '' <EOS>	91.59567950554637
<SOS> `` i shall be happy to do so ; the morning air has made me hungry . '' <EOS>	42.32359219054023
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos ; `` my air is excellent . '' <EOS>	119.36076230736542
<SOS> they went into the chateau ; there was nothing but gilding , high and low ; the cornices were gilt , the mouldings were gilt , the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt . <EOS>	102.9369268881132
<SOS> a table , ready set out , awaited them . <EOS>	103.05174561571542
<SOS> `` you see , '' said porthos , `` this is my usual style . '' <EOS>	112.57496724764763
<SOS> `` devil take me ! '' <EOS>	64.10553786484368
<SOS> answered d'artagnan , `` i wish you joy of it . <EOS>	60.27522092879104
<SOS> the king has nothing like it . '' <EOS>	64.71762047747133
<SOS> `` no , '' answered porthos , `` i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal , monsieur de mazarin . <EOS>	99.53237583910631

<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` ah ! <EOS>	43.88658442090604
<SOS> they are fed on thyme only , your hares . '' <EOS>	88.99321331489375
<SOS> `` and how do you like my wine ? '' <EOS>	58.63806600392873
<SOS> asked porthos ; `` it is pleasant , is n't it ? '' <EOS>	101.32576564211985
<SOS> `` capital ! '' <EOS>	107.89984005393109
<SOS> `` it is nothing , however , but a wine of the country . '' <EOS>	49.753393975311205
<SOS> `` really ? '' <EOS>	57.84975375478245
<SOS> `` yes , a small declivity to the south , yonder on my hill , gives me twenty hogsheads . '' <EOS>	71.50931689100759
<SOS> `` quite a vineyard , hey ? '' <EOS>	72.60234973278834
<SOS> porthos sighed for the fifth time d'artagnan had counted his sighs . <EOS>	101.65200858127338
<SOS> he became curious to solve the problem . <EOS>	76.80512286442318
<SOS> `` well now , '' he said , `` it seems , my dear friend , that something vexes you ; you are ill , perhaps ? <EOS>	97.29416155941635
<SOS> that health , which `` `` excellent , my dear friend ; better than ever . <EOS>	107.25953037199432

<SOS> porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine . <EOS>	43.38685581203797
<SOS> `` no ; but just think , there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne , or at least to hugh capet . <EOS>	78.81938595161769

<SOS> `` well , my friend , i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much . '' <EOS>	84.81168141413595
<SOS> porthos gave a start that shook the room ; two or three bottles fell and were broken . <EOS>	60.44260325368705
<SOS> mousqueton ran thither , hearing the noise . <EOS>	112.5566994598928
<SOS> porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles . <EOS>	67.22165276270522
<SOS> `` i am glad to see , '' said d'artagnan , `` that you have still that honest lad with you . '' <EOS>	58.630770355564366

<SOS> `` devil take them ; let us walk in the park , '' answered porthos , `` for the sake of digestion . '' <EOS>	79.72037230961594
<SOS> `` egad , '' said d'artagnan , `` the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren ; you are a happy man , my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase , but acquired that of fishing . '' <EOS>	78.55051989181028
<SOS> `` my friend , '' replied porthos , `` i leave fishing to mousqueton , it is a vulgar pleasure , but i shoot sometimes ; that is to say , when i am dull , and i sit on one of those marble seats , have my gun brought to me , my favorite dog , and i shoot rabbits . '' <EOS>	89.57987507199286

<SOS> `` but you know he is now our friend ? '' <EOS>	61.43364821528106

<SOS> `` you are mistaken , porthos , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.51676514842304
<SOS> `` it is i who cherish no resentment . '' <EOS>	66.66093909552309
<SOS> porthos did n't understand any too clearly ; but then we know that understanding was not his strong point . <EOS>	54.50452166350631
<SOS> `` you say , then , '' he continued , `` that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal ? '' <EOS>	84.46610456756038
<SOS> `` yes , and the queen , too . '' <EOS>	74.47898235669952
<SOS> `` the queen , do you say ? '' <EOS>	80.3119629648143
<SOS> `` to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarin 's hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which , i do n't know how , she has regained possession . '' <EOS>	72.23684226650332
<SOS> `` but it seems to me , '' said porthos , `` that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you . '' <EOS>	90.7708338796701
<SOS> `` so i think , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies ; nevertheless , since they are the ones who have riches and honors , we are devoted to them . '' <EOS>	50.049943337470964
<SOS> `` yes , we are devoted to them , '' repeated porthos ; `` and you to whom are you devoted now ? '' <EOS>	109.95092904055593

<SOS> my friend , '' said he , `` one never has too much money . <EOS>	64.90458219653965
<SOS> madame du vallon left things in much disorder ; i am not much of a hand at figures , so that i live almost from hand to mouth . '' <EOS>	108.52097450904478
<SOS> `` he is afraid i have come to borrow money , '' thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.96602758024261
<SOS> `` ah , my friend , '' said he , `` it is all the better if you are in difficulties . '' <EOS>	91.47224616692606
<SOS> `` how is it all the better ? '' <EOS>	78.48917815129542

<SOS> said porthos , opening his eyes at that last word . <EOS>	46.805351103081065
<SOS> `` under the other cardinal , '' continued d'artagnan , `` we did n't know enough to make our profits ; this , however , does n't concern you , with your forty thousand francs income , the happiest man in the world , it seems to me . '' <EOS>	44.09829686114352
<SOS> porthos sighed . <EOS>	61.51441110973248
<SOS> `` at the same time , '' continued d'artagnan , `` notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year , and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year , it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage , hey ? '' <EOS>	93.61526722137775
<SOS> `` yes indeed , '' said porthos . <EOS>	45.25956353433356

<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` that 's settled already ; i will be responsible for the barony . '' <EOS>	58.808200785067555
<SOS> on this promise being given , porthos , who had never doubted his friend 's assurance , turned back with him toward the castle . <EOS>	74.88537468841312
<SOS> chapter xii . <EOS>	60.34451692807552
<SOS> porthos was discontented with his condition . <EOS>	112.99234581539662
<SOS> as they returned toward the castle , d'artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature , always dissatisfied with what it has , ever desirous of what it has not . <EOS>	50.91714192648004
<SOS> in the position of porthos , d'artagnan would have been perfectly happy ; and to make porthos contented there was wanting what ? <EOS>	51.37206017097227
<SOS> five letters to put before his three names , a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage ! <EOS>	79.8801942955391
<SOS> `` i shall pass all my life , '' thought d'artagnan , `` in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot . '' <EOS>	70.01310382949977
<SOS> whilst making this reflection , chance seemed , as it were , to give him the lie direct . <EOS>	61.27069817526615
<SOS> when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching . <EOS>	54.28218730983097
<SOS> the face of the steward , despite one slight shade of care , light as a summer cloud , seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity . <EOS>	82.02762746053747
<SOS> `` here is what i am looking for , '' thought d'artagnan ; `` but alas ! <EOS>	51.513529579522086
<SOS> the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here . '' <EOS>	74.6295003674792
<SOS> he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him . <EOS>	68.51908419309241
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the servant , `` i have a favour to ask you . '' <EOS>	107.03837139033979

<SOS> `` art thou happy , friend ? '' <EOS>	70.77340004439975

<SOS> since i have had the honor of being my lord 's steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me . <EOS>	110.5716598877629
<SOS> you , sir , know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants . '' <EOS>	75.34537976658208
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled ; porthos wanted to lengthen out his names , mousqueton to cut his short . <EOS>	56.42067881234563
<SOS> `` well , my dear mouston , '' he said , `` rest satisfied . <EOS>	80.40970484044517
<SOS> i will call thee mouston ; and if it makes thee happy i will not 'tutoyer ' you any longer . '' <EOS>	109.74375311878073
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	80.09231802531451
<SOS> cried mousqueton , reddening with joy ; `` if you do me , sir , such honor , i shall be grateful all my life ; it is too much to ask . '' <EOS>	90.95040177389106
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	87.65634376402187
<SOS> thought d'artagnan , `` it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me . '' <EOS>	47.38635423076559
<SOS> `` will monsieur remain long with us ? '' <EOS>	72.30135487830854
<SOS> asked mousqueton , with a serene and glowing countenance . <EOS>	56.93360190080148
<SOS> `` i go to morrow , my friend , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	115.70498169158999
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur , '' said mousqueton , `` then you have come here only to awaken our regrets . '' <EOS>	79.22628433672335
<SOS> `` i fear that is true , '' said d'artagnan , in a low tone . <EOS>	88.82619402103676
<SOS> d'artagnan was secretly touched with remorse , not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy , for porthos , in the title of baron , had his object and reward ; but poor mousqueton , whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was ? <EOS>	90.56477195828282
<SOS> he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner . <EOS>	52.44004679672831
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	59.58417728096007
<SOS> to dinner ? '' <EOS>	105.14767896419492
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	99.43618680713443
<SOS> `` what time is it , then ? '' <EOS>	83.8668242034512
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	55.50644775223522
<SOS> why , it is after one o'clock . '' <EOS>	56.23468455722916
<SOS> `` your home is a paradise , porthos ; one takes no note of time . <EOS>	70.84637680484775
<SOS> i follow you , though i am not hungry . '' <EOS>	89.53629471809636
<SOS> `` come , if one ca n't always eat , one can always drink a maxim of poor athos , the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely . '' <EOS>	53.85298942192079
<SOS> d'artagnan , who as a gascon , was inclined to sobriety , seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos 's maxim , but he did his best to keep up with his host . <EOS>	74.83829685498382
<SOS> meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton , though he did not himself wait on the table , which would have been beneath him in his new position , appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d'artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served . <EOS>	70.92853044095123
<SOS> therefore , when , at dessert , upon a sign from d'artagnan , porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone : `` porthos , '' said d'artagnan , `` who will attend you in your campaigns ? '' <EOS>	92.37166884979527
<SOS> `` why , '' replied porthos , `` mouston , of course . '' <EOS>	110.9058397788867
<SOS> this was a blow to d'artagnan . <EOS>	82.89231408417386
<SOS> he could already see the intendant 's beaming smile change to a contortion of grief . <EOS>	92.41441405277303
<SOS> `` but , '' he said , `` mouston is not so young as he was , my dear fellow ; besides , he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service . '' <EOS>	77.09295282038978
<SOS> `` that may be true , '' replied porthos ; `` but i am used to him , and besides , he would n't be willing to let me go without him , he loves me so much . '' <EOS>	44.13187791859957
<SOS> `` oh , blind self love ! '' <EOS>	115.68844583005612
<SOS> thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	72.81058596797259
<SOS> `` and you , '' asked porthos , `` have n't you still in your service your old lackey , that good , that brave , that intelligent what , then , is his name ? '' <EOS>	109.42400955615919
<SOS> `` planchet yes , i have found him again , but he is lackey no longer . '' <EOS>	81.63868319198303
<SOS> `` what is he , then ? '' <EOS>	85.76502438439637
<SOS> `` with his sixteen hundred francs you remember , the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner . '' <EOS>	53.277631559282256
<SOS> `` ah , he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards ! <EOS>	91.05341489657977
<SOS> how does it happen , then , that he is in your service ? '' <EOS>	60.38978020608011
<SOS> `` he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed . '' <EOS>	58.883288546137635
<SOS> and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet 's adventure . <EOS>	62.58666133734781
<SOS> `` well , '' said porthos , `` if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it `` `` i should not have believed him ; but men are changed by events . '' <EOS>	99.02690181111377
<SOS> `` there is nothing truer than that , '' said porthos ; `` but what does not change , or changes for the better , is wine . <EOS>	78.14894863892664
<SOS> taste of this ; it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of . '' <EOS>	79.16682311559495
<SOS> at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed . <EOS>	74.90317609160088
<SOS> `` tell me , mouston , '' said porthos , `` are my arms in good condition ? '' <EOS>	66.9534380431898
<SOS> `` your arms , my lord what arms ? '' <EOS>	71.58899092555886
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	106.4970031358799

<SOS> `` what weapons ? '' <EOS>	86.24848864845686
<SOS> `` my military weapons . '' <EOS>	78.35438630959821
<SOS> `` yes , my lord ; at any rate , i think so . '' <EOS>	68.1179469343755
<SOS> `` make sure of it , and if they want it , have them burnished up . <EOS>	71.28251178827107
<SOS> which is my best cavalry horse ? '' <EOS>	45.60832493850947
<SOS> `` vulcan . '' <EOS>	93.86469075234233
<SOS> `` and the best hack ? '' <EOS>	72.07719989308984
<SOS> `` bayard . '' <EOS>	41.751218474829166
<SOS> `` what horse dost thou choose for thyself ? '' <EOS>	85.89869369814907
<SOS> `` i like rustaud , my lord ; a good animal , whose paces suit me . '' <EOS>	51.85835994584074
<SOS> `` strong , thinkest thou ? '' <EOS>	103.98742036869605
<SOS> `` half norman , half mecklenburger ; will go night and day . '' <EOS>	55.528720737867346
<SOS> `` that will do for us . <EOS>	60.11479705428561

<SOS> polish up or make some one else polish my arms . <EOS>	67.28841811104577
<SOS> then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife . '' <EOS>	78.57593596948035
<SOS> `` are we then going to travel , my lord ? '' <EOS>	78.78991755683211
<SOS> asked mousqueton , rather uneasy . <EOS>	108.52247241875484
<SOS> `` something better still , mouston . '' <EOS>	53.73460494617756
<SOS> `` an expedition , sir ? '' <EOS>	76.229593560253
<SOS> asked the steward , whose roses began to change into lilies . <EOS>	84.90738727119047
<SOS> `` we are going to return to the service , mouston , '' replied porthos , still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost . <EOS>	88.65549716301037
<SOS> `` into the service the king 's service ? '' <EOS>	92.5701234156941
<SOS> mousqueton trembled ; even his fat , smooth cheeks shook as he spoke , and he looked at d'artagnan with an air of reproach ; he staggered , and his voice was almost choked . <EOS>	79.25429131654597
<SOS> `` yes and no . <EOS>	87.82150097184979
<SOS> we shall serve in a campaign , seek out all sorts of adventures return , in short , to our former life . '' <EOS>	49.45546740589408
<SOS> these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt . <EOS>	69.60961862769986
<SOS> it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful , and the blow was so great he rushed out , overcome , and forgot to shut the door . <EOS>	89.92242515674967
<SOS> the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air . <EOS>	82.0517316635031
<SOS> the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d'artagnan a fine perspective , shining with quadruples and pistoles , and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle ; they were , in fact , asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed . <EOS>	104.11884012942434
<SOS> mousqueton was , however , somewhat consoled by d'artagnan , who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon , which was near corbeil , or bracieux , which was near melun , and of pierrefonds , which was between compiegne and villars cotterets . <EOS>	69.8437808763112
<SOS> `` but formerly it appears , '' began mousqueton timidly . <EOS>	86.09822344360326
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	56.76823830900089
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` we do n't now make war as we did formerly . <EOS>	111.71509704587447
<SOS> to day it 's a sort of diplomatic arrangement ; ask planchet . '' <EOS>	102.4644265514491
<SOS> mousqueton inquired , therefore , the state of the case of his old friend , who confirmed the statement of d'artagnan . <EOS>	117.99634711516265
<SOS> `` but , '' he added , `` in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung . '' <EOS>	81.28800806056893
<SOS> `` the deuce they do ! '' <EOS>	53.935653547700426
<SOS> said mousqueton ; `` i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war , then ! '' <EOS>	96.80207836659334
<SOS> porthos , meantime , asked d'artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey . <EOS>	104.28022485869145
<SOS> `` four days , '' replied his friend , `` are necessary to reach blois ; one day to rest there ; three or four days to return to paris . <EOS>	70.20516961350083
<SOS> set out , therefore , in a week , with your suite , and go to the hotel de la chevrette , rue tiquetonne , and there await me . '' <EOS>	65.29421018786735
<SOS> `` that 's agreed , '' said porthos . <EOS>	62.943958341253705
<SOS> `` as to myself , i shall go around to see athos ; for though i do n't think his aid worth much , one must with one 's friends observe all due politeness , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	49.57466408423879
<SOS> the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds , to which porthos escorted his friend . <EOS>	75.11594248935755
<SOS> `` at least , '' d'artagnan said to himself , as he took the road to villars cotterets , `` at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking . <EOS>	109.13447172937934
<SOS> that devil , porthos , is a man of prodigious strength ; still , if athos joins us , well , we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis , that little coxcomb with his too good luck . '' <EOS>	68.45703212561125
<SOS> at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal : `` my lord , i have already one man to offer to your eminence , and he is well worth twenty men . <EOS>	55.25279965553461
<SOS> i am just setting out for blois . <EOS>	66.76893269069738
<SOS> the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne , in the environs of that city . '' <EOS>	74.75789681946759
<SOS> chapter xiii . <EOS>	73.33632417850086
<SOS> two angelic faces . <EOS>	80.90546085374469
<SOS> the road was long , but the horses upon which d'artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux ; the master and servant rode side by side , conversing as they went , for d'artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant . <EOS>	55.52392345562891
<SOS> he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master . <EOS>	69.61633394799485
<SOS> it was many years since d'artagnan had opened his heart to any one ; it happened , however , that these two men , on meeting again , assimilated perfectly . <EOS>	107.41110185290738
<SOS> planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures ; he was a man of uncommonly sound sense . <EOS>	69.50180462036103
<SOS> without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter ; in short , he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man ; it was , therefore , on the footing of friends that d'artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois . <EOS>	63.05687256941441
<SOS> going along , d'artagnan , shaking his head , said : `` i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd ; but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend , a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters . '' <EOS>	61.319426436479354
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur athos was a noble gentleman , '' said planchet , `` was he not ? <EOS>	91.77079329211452
<SOS> scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain . <EOS>	65.23545051250905
<SOS> do you remember , sir , that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes ? <EOS>	87.25599134994238
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	70.79987866261716
<SOS> how lofty , how magnificent monsieur athos was that day , when he said to his adversary : 'you have insisted on knowing my name , sir ; so much the worse for you , since i shall be obliged to kill you . ' <EOS>	62.38195910146721
<SOS> i was near him , those were his exact words , when he stabbed his foe as he said he would , and his adversary fell without saying , 'oh ! ' <EOS>	97.68598105805766
<SOS> 't is a noble gentleman monsieur athos . '' <EOS>	69.47083990339056
<SOS> `` yes , true as gospel , '' said d'artagnan ; `` but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities . '' <EOS>	111.99356074975331
<SOS> `` i remember well , '' said planchet , `` he was fond of drinking in truth , he drank , but not as other men drink . <EOS>	80.44403428036578
<SOS> one seemed , as he raised the wine to his lips , to hear him say , 'come , juice of the grape , and chase away my sorrows . ' <EOS>	46.47911561561353
<SOS> and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle ! <EOS>	62.50992513485049
<SOS> there was no one like him for that . '' <EOS>	80.6770602033336
<SOS> `` and now , '' replied d'artagnan , `` behold the sad spectacle that awaits us . <EOS>	86.34927113729725
<SOS> this noble gentleman with his lofty glance , this handsome cavalier , so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command ! <EOS>	108.03900507056174
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	72.41838885579179
<SOS> we shall find him changed into a broken down old man , with garnet nose and eyes that slobber ; we shall find him extended on some lawn , whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us . <EOS>	58.8335766189106
<SOS> god knows , planchet , that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere , whom we loved so much . '' <EOS>	90.47482817050926
<SOS> planchet shook his head and said nothing . <EOS>	71.68412630012274
<SOS> it was evident that he shared his master 's apprehensions . <EOS>	73.90092748195417
<SOS> `` and then , '' resumed d'artagnan , `` to this decrepitude is probably added poverty , for he must have neglected the little that he had , and the dirty scoundrel , grimaud , more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay , planchet , it breaks my heart to merely think of it . '' <EOS>	86.28449548809944
<SOS> `` i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering , '' said planchet , in a piteous tone , `` but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things , for i imagine that those lofty walls , now turning ruby in the setting sun , are the walls of blois . '' <EOS>	77.50518120218561
<SOS> `` probably ; and those steeples , pointed and sculptured , that we catch a glimpse of yonder , are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord . '' <EOS>	94.29976847162031
<SOS> at this moment one of those heavy wagons , drawn by bullocks , which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire , came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following . <EOS>	79.43749613136664
<SOS> a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it , with which he urged on his slow team , was walking with the cart . <EOS>	72.09943836965247
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	56.97383009707876
<SOS> friend , '' cried planchet . <EOS>	53.41174140133755
<SOS> `` what 's your pleasure , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	87.75203342184797
<SOS> replied the peasant , with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l'universite . <EOS>	82.75075632755532
<SOS> `` we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	59.16851809770049
<SOS> the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name . <EOS>	51.29328893143571
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , `` the wood that i am carting is his ; i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau . '' <EOS>	84.38894006167652
<SOS> d'artagnan determined not to question this man ; he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet . <EOS>	82.63608136800266
<SOS> `` the chateau ! '' <EOS>	69.69776396614604
<SOS> he said to himself , `` what chateau ? <EOS>	62.360239972951184
<SOS> ah , i understand ! <EOS>	52.81956148275445
<SOS> athos is not a man to be thwarted ; he , like porthos , has obliged his peasantry to call him 'my lord , ' and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau . <EOS>	78.1822399832095
<SOS> he had a heavy hand dear old athos after drinking . '' <EOS>	63.24885248235529
<SOS> d'artagnan , after asking the man the right way , continued his route , agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman . <EOS>	70.13773611804663
<SOS> he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on , his head drooping as if in deep thought . <EOS>	49.787449559563115
<SOS> soon , as the road turned , the chateau de la valliere appeared in view ; then , a quarter of a mile beyond , a white house , encircled in sycamores , was visible at the farther end of a group of trees , which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers . <EOS>	59.59135939405
<SOS> on beholding this house , d'artagnan , calm as he was in general , felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth . <EOS>	51.17193408375483
<SOS> he proceeded , nevertheless , and came opposite to an iron gate , ornamented in the taste of the period . <EOS>	99.64580204357999
<SOS> through the gate was seen kitchen gardens , carefully attended to , a spacious courtyard , in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries , and a carriage , drawn by two horses of the country . <EOS>	78.6987222247913
<SOS> `` we are mistaken , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.67041910061708
<SOS> `` this can not be the establishment of athos . <EOS>	70.15786833654607
<SOS> good heavens ! <EOS>	83.2788439706306
<SOS> suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name . <EOS>	86.8940037241737
<SOS> alight , planchet , and inquire , for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do . '' <EOS>	91.23219690209334
<SOS> planchet alighted . <EOS>	89.54587618722387
<SOS> `` thou must add , '' said d'artagnan , `` that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere , and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest , then mention my name ! '' <EOS>	71.02631826334921
<SOS> planchet , leading his horse by the bridle , drew near to the gate and rang the bell , and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature , notwithstanding his age , presented himself . <EOS>	70.30587863654307
<SOS> `` does monsieur le comte de la fere live here ? '' <EOS>	52.69223850450254
<SOS> asked planchet . <EOS>	74.39153722784705
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , it is here he lives , '' the servant replied to planchet , who was not in livery . <EOS>	76.34693319688799
<SOS> `` a nobleman retired from service , is he not ? '' <EOS>	79.81895258088821
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	81.47843892755489
<SOS> `` and who had a lackey named grimaud ? '' <EOS>	100.27943123831204
<SOS> persisted planchet , who had prudently considered that he could n't have too much information . <EOS>	46.34456175076942
<SOS> `` monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being , '' said the servitor , who , little used as he was to such inquiries , began to examine planchet from head to foot . <EOS>	75.23501667813605
<SOS> `` then , '' cried planchet joyously , `` i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek . <EOS>	64.87088466135432
<SOS> be good enough to open to me , for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master , one of his friends , is here , and wishes to greet him . '' <EOS>	84.2298263103769
<SOS> `` why did n't you say so ? '' <EOS>	65.11354550914969
<SOS> said the servitor , opening the gate . <EOS>	88.09796543121183
<SOS> `` but where is your master ? '' <EOS>	41.183491407465745
<SOS> `` he is following me . '' <EOS>	49.381931803474714
<SOS> the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet , who made a sign to d'artagnan . <EOS>	90.68920239320491
<SOS> the latter , his heart palpitating more than ever , entered the courtyard without dismounting . <EOS>	90.29242715453601
<SOS> whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say : `` well , where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here ? '' <EOS>	73.36395957788552
<SOS> this voice , the sound of which reached d'artagnan , reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments , a thousand recollections that he had forgotten . <EOS>	115.07157239123364
<SOS> he vaulted hastily from his horse , whilst planchet , with a smile on his lips , advanced toward the master of the house . <EOS>	89.78085313503918
<SOS> `` but i know you , my lad , '' said athos , appearing on the threshold . <EOS>	59.490128045245534
<SOS> `` oh , yes , monsieur le comte , you know me and i know you . <EOS>	73.26172376590289
<SOS> i am planchet planchet , whom you know well . '' <EOS>	71.37630515530927
<SOS> but the honest servant could say no more , so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview . <EOS>	64.29125122913592
<SOS> `` what , planchet , is monsieur d'artagnan here ? '' <EOS>	80.55552708590139
<SOS> `` here i am , my friend , dear athos ! '' <EOS>	83.08334490500006
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation . <EOS>	74.80981181664737
<SOS> at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos . <EOS>	70.12575687367924
<SOS> he rushed toward d'artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms . <EOS>	51.425927240243645
<SOS> d'artagnan , equally moved , pressed him also closely to him , whilst tears stood in his eyes . <EOS>	104.73630235795595
<SOS> athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room , where there were several people . <EOS>	102.6340405377659
<SOS> every one arose . <EOS>	64.7439744466908
<SOS> `` i present to you , '' he said , `` monsieur le chevalier d'artagnan , lieutenant of his majesty 's musketeers , a devoted friend and one of the most excellent , brave gentlemen that i have ever known . '' <EOS>	99.41752883433584
<SOS> d'artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way , and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos . <EOS>	106.20911131891197
<SOS> strange ! <EOS>	56.32165971745192
<SOS> athos was scarcely aged at all ! <EOS>	87.80516380914418
<SOS> his fine eyes , no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly , seemed larger , more liquid than ever . <EOS>	48.43063281695388
<SOS> his face , a little elongated , had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement . <EOS>	93.47756140163453
<SOS> his hand , always wonderfully beautiful and strong , was set off by a ruffle of lace , like certain hands by titian and vandyck . <EOS>	59.01617844670733
<SOS> he was less stiff than formerly . <EOS>	63.29008243285558
<SOS> his long , dark hair , softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils , fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls ; his voice was still youthful , as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five , and his magnificent teeth , which he had preserved white and sound , gave an indescribable charm to his smile . <EOS>	46.77210039948532
<SOS> meanwhile the guests , seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone , prepared to depart , when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment : `` ah ! <EOS>	67.50835477159835
<SOS> 't is raoul , who is come home . '' <EOS>	104.08938901653106
<SOS> athos , as the name of raoul was pronounced , looked inquisitively at d'artagnan , in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face . <EOS>	94.62371894982807
<SOS> but d'artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age , dressed simply , but in perfect taste , entered the room , raising , as he came , his hat , adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers . <EOS>	66.87790699363377
<SOS> nevertheless , d'artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage . <EOS>	73.996651433861
<SOS> it seemed to explain to him the change in athos ; a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence . <EOS>	58.598085905706874
<SOS> he remained listening and gazing . <EOS>	70.90055786421594
<SOS> `` here you are , home again , raoul , '' said the comte . <EOS>	78.8992736989209
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the youth , with deep respect , `` and i have performed the commission that you gave me . '' <EOS>	69.17900278840946
<SOS> `` but what 's the matter , raoul ? '' <EOS>	68.90127568209233
<SOS> said athos , very anxiously . <EOS>	79.12346729342238
<SOS> `` you are pale and agitated . '' <EOS>	75.3803391911211
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied the young man , `` it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor . '' <EOS>	86.30686826196363
<SOS> `` to mademoiselle de la valliere ? '' <EOS>	122.31636246903844
<SOS> asked athos , quickly . <EOS>	96.90106400597864
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	106.18418957289816
<SOS> cried many persons present . <EOS>	90.92113543220832
<SOS> `` she was walking with her nurse marceline , in the place where the woodmen cut the wood , when , passing on horseback , i stopped . <EOS>	43.87551678664758
<SOS> she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted , the poor child fell and was not able to rise again . <EOS>	74.96201787657823
<SOS> i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle . '' <EOS>	80.06382309703037
<SOS> `` oh , heavens ! '' <EOS>	84.65298102267904
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	43.957774806300336
<SOS> `` and her mother , madame de saint remy , have they yet told her of it ? '' <EOS>	90.67481143064941
<SOS> `` no , sir , madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans . <EOS>	47.20720236121177
<SOS> i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful , if not worse than useless . <EOS>	74.03524366500345
<SOS> i am come , sir , to ask your advice . '' <EOS>	43.66538457839961
<SOS> `` send directly to blois , raoul ; or , rather , take horse and ride immediately yourself . '' <EOS>	75.50472444120005
<SOS> raoul bowed . <EOS>	67.69137336506466
<SOS> `` but where is louise ? '' <EOS>	62.122893722061754
<SOS> asked the comte . <EOS>	82.5524358643976
<SOS> `` i have brought her here , sir , and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte , who , till better advice comes , has bathed the foot in cold well water . '' <EOS>	65.45509196030369
<SOS> the guests now all took leave of athos , excepting the old duc de barbe , who , as an old friend of the family of la valliere , went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage . <EOS>	110.61476596265453
<SOS> `` you are right , sir , '' said athos . <EOS>	56.857814381460216
<SOS> `` she will be the sooner with her mother . <EOS>	57.45380690530492
<SOS> as for you , raoul , i am sure it is your fault , some giddiness or folly . '' <EOS>	56.40866774686942
<SOS> `` no , sir , i assure you , '' muttered raoul , `` it is not . '' <EOS>	49.59800576090216
<SOS> `` oh , no , no , i declare it is not ! '' <EOS>	49.10050625366278
<SOS> cried the young girl , while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster . <EOS>	43.156064798034066
<SOS> `` nevertheless , raoul , you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saint remy . '' <EOS>	79.53957926278649
<SOS> the youth looked pleased . <EOS>	58.47778591299466
<SOS> he again took in his strong arms the little girl , whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder , and placed her gently in the carriage ; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire , after bowing to athos and d'artagnan , he went off close by the door of the carriage , on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted . <EOS>	44.34227312507558
<SOS> chapter xiv . <EOS>	76.67327514028236
<SOS> the castle of bragelonne . <EOS>	82.64136739261755
<SOS> whilst this scene was going on , d'artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze . <EOS>	70.9788700501067
<SOS> everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder . <EOS>	65.96090566528781
<SOS> athos , who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts , took his arm and led him into the garden . <EOS>	51.91971574142076
<SOS> `` whilst supper is being prepared , '' he said , smiling , `` you will not , my friend , be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up . '' <EOS>	47.80038652641746
<SOS> `` true , monsieur le comte , '' replied d'artagnan , who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him . <EOS>	70.53542330574993
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	53.15894229201536
<SOS> `` first and foremost , dear d'artagnan , we have no title such as count here . <EOS>	57.17152151595216
<SOS> when i call you 'chevalier , ' it is in presenting you to my guests , that they may know who you are . <EOS>	57.047109188692545
<SOS> but to you , d'artagnan , i am , i hope , still dear athos , your comrade , your friend . <EOS>	111.64692337158522
<SOS> do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were ? '' <EOS>	60.86417107373181
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	86.11824515212747
<SOS> god forbid ! '' <EOS>	67.99721627528655
<SOS> `` then let us be as we used to be ; let us be open with each other . <EOS>	84.00280635262708
<SOS> you are surprised at what you see here ? '' <EOS>	73.16127661972921
<SOS> `` extremely . '' <EOS>	83.64347747374893
<SOS> `` but above all things , i am a marvel to you ? '' <EOS>	97.53786903449557
<SOS> `` i confess it . '' <EOS>	86.48601059447785
<SOS> `` i am still young , am i not ? <EOS>	80.82144316858836
<SOS> should you not have known me again , in spite of my eight and forty years of age ? '' <EOS>	62.21488410773249
<SOS> `` on the contrary , i do not find you the same person at all . '' <EOS>	62.48107494428297
<SOS> `` i understand , '' cried athos , with a gentle blush . <EOS>	102.85749133133028
<SOS> `` everything , d'artagnan , even folly , has its limit . '' <EOS>	40.51825464878962
<SOS> `` then your means , it appears , are improved ; you have a capital house your own , i presume ? <EOS>	56.5045794244125
<SOS> you have a park , and horses , servants . '' <EOS>	68.05563189904124
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	75.44038051448115
<SOS> `` yes , i inherited this little property when i quitted the army , as i told you . <EOS>	94.02445035734618
<SOS> the park is twenty acres twenty , comprising kitchen gardens and a common . <EOS>	62.49748036589297
<SOS> i have two horses , i do not count my servant 's bobtailed nag . <EOS>	62.667726993372355
<SOS> my sporting dogs consist of two pointers , two harriers and two setters . <EOS>	65.74609287433326
<SOS> but then all this extravagance is not for myself , '' added athos , laughing . <EOS>	52.6318937047281
<SOS> `` yes , i see , for the young man raoul , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	40.8812264250363
<SOS> `` you guess aright , my friend ; this youth is an orphan , deserted by his mother , who left him in the house of a poor country priest . <EOS>	99.88404974496314
<SOS> i have brought him up . <EOS>	73.58902751499483
<SOS> it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see ; i was dried up like a miserable tree , isolated , attached to nothing on earth ; it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life . <EOS>	110.12165940066242
<SOS> this child has caused me to recover what i had lost . <EOS>	62.524357822365296
<SOS> i had no longer any wish to live for myself , i have lived for him . <EOS>	93.68541014328112
<SOS> i have corrected the vices that i had ; i have assumed the virtues that i had not . <EOS>	100.13260701926473
<SOS> precept something , but example more . <EOS>	86.05117065371351
<SOS> i may be mistaken , but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display . '' <EOS>	92.51461341598535
<SOS> the remembrance of milady recurred to d'artagnan . <EOS>	73.87003677277717
<SOS> `` and you are happy ? '' <EOS>	59.54993892423772
<SOS> he said to his friend . <EOS>	69.19564106431291
<SOS> `` as happy as it is allowed to one of god 's creatures to be on this earth ; but say out all you think , d'artagnan , for you have not yet done so . '' <EOS>	115.70981073832591
<SOS> `` you are too bad , athos ; one can hide nothing from you , '' answered d'artagnan . <EOS>	49.363025273398605
<SOS> `` i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling `` `` remorse ! <EOS>	53.60241189345944

<SOS> i do not feel remorse , because that woman , i profoundly hold , deserved her punishment . <EOS>	104.86606273637398
<SOS> had she one redeeming trait ? <EOS>	58.899765463262675
<SOS> i doubt it . <EOS>	69.83707943919153
<SOS> i do not feel remorse , because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction . <EOS>	48.005368802184044
<SOS> but i do not mean , my friend that we were right in what we did . <EOS>	43.89822790200667
<SOS> perhaps all blood demands some expiation . <EOS>	103.24336434320522
<SOS> hers had been accomplished ; it remains , possibly , for us to accomplish ours . '' <EOS>	92.58458107446317
<SOS> `` i have sometimes thought as you do , athos . '' <EOS>	59.666056539391015
<SOS> `` she had a son , that unhappy woman ? '' <EOS>	68.31773146172083
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	99.56923913783606

<SOS> `` never . '' <EOS>	47.195048979475345
<SOS> `` he must be about twenty three years of age , '' said athos , in a low tone . <EOS>	53.974184156721535
<SOS> `` i often think of that young man , d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	58.511149547063326
<SOS> `` strange ! <EOS>	65.85493063328744

<SOS> athos smiled ; the smile was melancholy . <EOS>	85.51674869307439
<SOS> `` and lord de winter do you know anything about him ? '' <EOS>	71.00603041706216
<SOS> `` i know that he is in high favor with charles i . '' <EOS>	62.35599756722099
<SOS> `` the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water . <EOS>	57.78219645704827

<SOS> `` no ; but my mother , as a child , saw her . <EOS>	41.87903470058727

<SOS> `` never . <EOS>	56.74370994532019
<SOS> you know , athos , you never spoke much of such matters . '' <EOS>	95.02932948206697
<SOS> `` ah , mon dieu , yes , you are right , '' athos replied ; `` but then there must be some occasion for speaking . '' <EOS>	73.8956182115026

<SOS> have you seen him ? '' <EOS>	62.551992302595785
<SOS> `` i left him five days ago , '' said d'artagnan , and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds ; nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston . <EOS>	71.97491569691229
<SOS> `` i sometimes wonder , '' replied athos , smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days , `` that we could form an association of men who would be , after twenty years of separation , still so closely bound together . <EOS>	52.50610861463402

<SOS> `` why , it is a veritable pilgrimage , my dear friend , that you are making to the temple of friendship , as the poets would say . '' <EOS>	89.01438220365357
<SOS> `` why , yes , '' replied d'artagnan , with embarrassment . <EOS>	49.633611936762186
<SOS> `` aramis , you know , '' continued athos , `` is naturally cold , and then he is always involved in intrigues with women . '' <EOS>	85.45488593114308

<SOS> athos made no reply . <EOS>	90.90651839608014
<SOS> `` he is not curious , '' thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	80.86152351890644
<SOS> athos not only failed to reply , he even changed the subject of conversation . <EOS>	114.56307987000655
<SOS> `` you see , '' said he , calling d'artagnan 's attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour 's walk , `` we have made a tour of my domains . '' <EOS>	74.44516749228897
<SOS> `` all is charming and everything savors of nobility , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	85.72747851555282
<SOS> at this instant they heard the sound of horses ' feet . <EOS>	53.18203948743289
<SOS> `` 't is raoul who has come back , '' said athos ; `` and we can now hear how the poor child is . '' <EOS>	96.67303266370452
<SOS> in fact , the young man appeared at the gate , covered with dust , entered the courtyard , leaped from his horse , which he consigned to the charge of a groom , and then went to greet the count and d'artagnan . <EOS>	76.14196263987667
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said athos , placing his hand on d'artagnan 's shoulder , `` monsieur is the chevalier d'artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak , raoul . '' <EOS>	64.6834662413619
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said the young man , saluting again and more profoundly , `` monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman . '' <EOS>	85.1109681342442
<SOS> that little compliment could not fail to move d'artagnan . <EOS>	84.30517193534845
<SOS> he extended a hand to raoul and said : `` my young friend , all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here ; for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions . <EOS>	103.57654914117467
<SOS> but he will make it up in you i am sure . <EOS>	99.6600744664116
<SOS> i like your manner , raoul , and your politeness has touched me . '' <EOS>	61.56091177757096
<SOS> athos was more delighted than can be told . <EOS>	69.8702438553593
<SOS> he looked at d'artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles , of which children are so proud when they receive them . <EOS>	89.17505418594996
<SOS> `` now , '' said d'artagnan to himself , noticing that silent play of countenance , `` i am sure of it . '' <EOS>	67.87139779607429
<SOS> `` i hope the accident has been of no consequence ? '' <EOS>	94.239625794463
<SOS> `` they do n't yet know , sir , on account of the swelling ; but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured . '' <EOS>	91.23093860214028
<SOS> at this moment a little boy , half peasant , half foot boy , came to announce supper . <EOS>	100.33810077529323
<SOS> athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size , the windows of which opened on one side on a garden , on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers . <EOS>	73.31546279979533
<SOS> d'artagnan glanced at the dinner service . <EOS>	104.08732994753497
<SOS> the plate was magnificent , old , and appertaining to the family . <EOS>	71.4649206930589
<SOS> d'artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver . <EOS>	78.03740772373877
<SOS> `` that workmanship is divine ! '' <EOS>	45.84073365401337
<SOS> he exclaimed . <EOS>	80.0747045468102
<SOS> `` yes , a chef d'oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor , benvenuto cellini , '' replied athos . <EOS>	78.60580770926478
<SOS> `` what battle does it represent ? '' <EOS>	43.329300823839375
<SOS> `` that of marignan , just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i. , who has broken his . <EOS>	116.00718884802296
<SOS> it was on that occasion that my ancestor , enguerrand de la fere , was made a knight of the order of st. michael ; besides which , the king , fifteen years afterward , gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house , also a lovely specimen of workmanship . <EOS>	105.39048433293996
<SOS> men were giants in those times , '' said athos ; `` now we are pigmies in comparison . <EOS>	53.95006580097451
<SOS> let us sit down to supper . <EOS>	65.47664225692394
<SOS> call charles , '' he added , addressing the boy who waited . <EOS>	66.27433565123124
<SOS> `` my good charles , i particularly recommend to your care planchet , the laquais of monsieur d'artagnan . <EOS>	64.93037190265652
<SOS> he likes good wine ; now you have the key of the cellar . <EOS>	86.89322389843507
<SOS> he has slept a long time on a hard bed , so he wo n't object to a soft one ; take every care of him , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	53.326381192781824
<SOS> charles bowed and retired . <EOS>	80.07598859410923
<SOS> `` you think of everything , '' said d'artagnan ; `` and i thank you for planchet , my dear athos . '' <EOS>	63.72347523323263
<SOS> raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed . <EOS>	69.14693896000875
<SOS> `` that name sounds strange to you , '' said athos , smiling ; `` it was my nom de guerre when monsieur d'artagnan , two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle , under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre . <EOS>	79.60605631935661
<SOS> my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation , which makes my heart glad when i hear it . '' <EOS>	70.75220638153353
<SOS> `` 't is an illustrious name , '' said the lieutenant , `` and had one day triumphal honors paid to it . '' <EOS>	66.88439757023
<SOS> `` what do you mean , sir ? '' <EOS>	78.17462089805805
<SOS> inquired raoul . <EOS>	46.1418920916977
<SOS> `` you have not forgotten st. gervais , athos , and the napkin which was converted into a banner ? '' <EOS>	52.14287238255277
<SOS> and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion , and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry , so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto . <EOS>	78.26895611462353
<SOS> `` d'artagnan does not tell you , raoul , '' said athos , in his turn , `` that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time a knuckle of iron , a wrist of steel , a sure eye and a glance of fire ; that 's what his adversary met with . <EOS>	65.83883208110821
<SOS> he was eighteen , only three years older than you are , raoul , when i saw him set to work , pitted against tried men . '' <EOS>	61.46268354079195
<SOS> `` and did monsieur d'artagnan come off the conqueror ? '' <EOS>	70.87889018351977
<SOS> asked the young man , with glistening eye . <EOS>	87.14392881368961
<SOS> `` i killed one man , if i recollect rightly , '' replied d'artagnan , with a look of inquiry directed to athos ; `` another i disarmed or wounded , i do n't remember which . '' <EOS>	99.89090320304803
<SOS> `` wounded ! '' <EOS>	69.27203213019398
<SOS> said athos ; `` it was a phenomenon of skill . '' <EOS>	65.98158358519613
<SOS> the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night , but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose . <EOS>	111.15567883513668
<SOS> d'artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued , but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber , conducted thither by raoul . <EOS>	49.011332000906194
<SOS> chapter xv . <EOS>	49.29373142196908
<SOS> athos as a diplomatist . <EOS>	80.0604943778852
<SOS> d'artagnan retired to bed not to sleep , but to think over all he had heard that evening . <EOS>	52.10602131113221
<SOS> being naturally goodhearted , and having had once a liking for athos , which had grown into a sincere friendship , he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength , instead of a drunkard . <EOS>	61.505059392620765
<SOS> he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself , devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition ; he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission . <EOS>	58.72209454586871
<SOS> nevertheless , it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank . <EOS>	67.62872364219623
<SOS> who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him ? <EOS>	48.92856543814045
<SOS> what could explain athos 's having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table ? <EOS>	102.46297073171138
<SOS> the absence of grimaud , whose name had never once been uttered by athos , gave d'artagnan uneasiness . <EOS>	66.40161665129963
<SOS> it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend , or that athos was bound by some invisible chain , or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant 's visit . <EOS>	63.22251385986618
<SOS> he could not help thinking of m. rochefort , whom he had seen in notre dame ; could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos ? <EOS>	70.18137876260116
<SOS> again , the moderate fortune which athos possessed , concealed as it was , so skillfully , seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused . <EOS>	62.34688875731654
<SOS> the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be . <EOS>	65.06635847757784
<SOS> he would enter into the minister 's schemes with the more ardor , because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity . <EOS>	71.28047421847842
<SOS> resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day , d'artagnan , in spite of his fatigue , prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast . <EOS>	81.41302086062365
<SOS> he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and , either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting , to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present . <EOS>	91.4455704402921
<SOS> but d'artagnan at the same time , being a man of extreme caution , was quite aware what injury he should do himself , if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos . <EOS>	84.81940286430576
<SOS> besides , to tell truth , whilst d'artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos , he was ashamed to equivocate with athos , true hearted , open athos . <EOS>	84.20956607125171
<SOS> it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy , they would like him all the better for it ; but that athos , on the contrary , would despise him . <EOS>	59.59757783804628
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	67.81911807367975
<SOS> why is not grimaud , the taciturn grimaud , here ? '' <EOS>	72.34731465965405
<SOS> thought d'artagnan , `` there are so many things his silence would have told me ; with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence ! '' <EOS>	40.37708454718024
<SOS> there reigned a perfect stillness in the house . <EOS>	98.0722729017517
<SOS> d'artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred ; the dogs became in their turn silent . <EOS>	99.95821258665774
<SOS> at last a nightingale , lost in a thicket of shrubs , in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep . <EOS>	71.14154697260639
<SOS> not a sound was heard in the castle , except of a footstep up and down , in the chamber above as he supposed , the bedroom of athos . <EOS>	94.82690951528757
<SOS> `` he is walking about and thinking , '' thought d'artagnan ; `` but of what ? <EOS>	58.759249287969226
<SOS> it is impossible to know ; everything else might be guessed , but not that . '' <EOS>	80.99986657808904
<SOS> at length athos went to bed , apparently , for the noise ceased . <EOS>	60.516558307739956
<SOS> silence and fatigue together overcame d'artagnan and sleep overtook him also . <EOS>	86.39930718218781
<SOS> he was not , however , a good sleeper . <EOS>	88.81329695456976
<SOS> scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows . <EOS>	75.26868842113241
<SOS> somebody , he perceived , was in the courtyard , moving stealthily . <EOS>	90.15592966242612
<SOS> true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know , d'artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul . <EOS>	89.52472778416808
<SOS> the young man was opening the door of the stable . <EOS>	45.275491554197686
<SOS> he then , with noiseless haste , took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening , saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden , opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road , shut it after him , and d'artagnan saw him pass by like a dart , bending , as he went , beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia . <EOS>	55.55691872678386
<SOS> the road , as d'artagnan had observed , was the way to blois . <EOS>	67.98882381202372
<SOS> `` so ! '' <EOS>	69.40158769584093
<SOS> thought the gascon `` here 's a young blade who has already his love affair , who does n't at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex . <EOS>	70.44655920140615
<SOS> he 's not going to hunt , for he has neither dogs nor arms ; he 's not going on a message , for he goes secretly . <EOS>	60.423782860441996
<SOS> why does he go in secret ? <EOS>	106.27895660447246
<SOS> is he afraid of me or of his father ? <EOS>	78.81801422057919
<SOS> for i am sure the count is his father . <EOS>	72.55840733131322
<SOS> by jove ! <EOS>	106.53589279792135
<SOS> i shall know about that soon , for i shall soon speak out to athos . '' <EOS>	74.88583419674974
<SOS> day was now advanced ; all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened , one after the other . <EOS>	42.655810519227906
<SOS> the bird on the branch , the dog in his kennel , the sheep in the field , the boats moored in the loire , even , became alive and vocal . <EOS>	74.9818008850682
<SOS> the latter , leaving the shore , abandoned themselves gaily to the current . <EOS>	52.427134455313436
<SOS> the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache , a last turn to his hair , brushed , from habit , the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet , and went downstairs . <EOS>	77.19086867401374
<SOS> scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground , as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust . <EOS>	83.38072254679405
<SOS> `` good morning , my dear host , '' cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	72.20746997354046
<SOS> `` good day to you ; have you slept well ? '' <EOS>	58.97649923353944
<SOS> `` excellently , athos , but what are you looking for ? <EOS>	103.12695027629805
<SOS> you are perhaps a tulip fancier ? '' <EOS>	106.44133872995548
<SOS> `` my dear friend , if i am , you must not laugh at me for being so . <EOS>	59.15133886841566
<SOS> in the country people alter ; one gets to like , without knowing it , all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth , which are despised in cities . <EOS>	63.64456234058806
<SOS> i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here , close to this reservoir , and which some one has trampled upon this morning . <EOS>	59.08596994971351
<SOS> these gardeners are the most careless people in the world ; in bringing the horse out to the water they 've allowed him to walk over the border . '' <EOS>	75.11092411409766
<SOS> d'artagnan began to smile . <EOS>	50.540649129452994
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	80.7644992854766
<SOS> you think so , do you ? '' <EOS>	88.30395271844668
<SOS> and he took his friend along the alley , where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds , were visible . <EOS>	64.1346443300025
<SOS> `` here are the horse 's hoofs again , it seems , athos , '' he said carelessly . <EOS>	58.5382598028021
<SOS> `` yes , indeed , the marks are recent . '' <EOS>	70.18375964007734
<SOS> `` quite so , '' replied the lieutenant . <EOS>	60.474655950711615
<SOS> `` who went out this morning ? '' <EOS>	70.42424339922316
<SOS> athos asked , uneasily . <EOS>	62.8642222996263
<SOS> `` has any horse got loose ? '' <EOS>	56.591003025669075
<SOS> `` not likely , '' answered the gascon ; `` these marks are regular . '' <EOS>	62.83779909490544
<SOS> `` where is raoul ? '' <EOS>	71.74187442773221
<SOS> asked athos ; `` how is it that i have not seen him ? '' <EOS>	107.29838962466887
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	121.2434790890896
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , putting his finger on his lips ; and he related what he had seen , watching athos all the while . <EOS>	73.29835653117746
<SOS> `` ah , he 's gone to blois ; the poor boy `` `` wherefore ? '' <EOS>	110.82055692021285
<SOS> `` ah , to inquire after the little la valliere ; she has sprained her foot , you know . '' <EOS>	43.796886770949015
<SOS> `` you think he has ? '' <EOS>	60.35137202346973
<SOS> `` i am sure of it , '' said athos ; `` do n't you see that raoul is in love ? '' <EOS>	59.13328384994741
<SOS> `` indeed ! <EOS>	67.63571624140602
<SOS> with whom with a child seven years old ? '' <EOS>	43.80253743932282
<SOS> `` dear friend , at raoul 's age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another , fancied or real . <EOS>	107.28674282519198
<SOS> well , his love is half real , half fanciful . <EOS>	69.00416486114126
<SOS> she is the prettiest little creature in the world , with flaxen hair , blue eyes , at once saucy and languishing . '' <EOS>	85.10508151465119
<SOS> `` but what say you to raoul 's fancy ? '' <EOS>	110.17778670040752
<SOS> `` nothing i laugh at raoul ; but this first desire of the heart is imperious . <EOS>	62.15587825605795
<SOS> i remember , just at his age , how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king , then henry iv. , gave my father , insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable . '' <EOS>	59.8190257293207
<SOS> `` it is mere want of occupation . <EOS>	76.14723131855835
<SOS> you do not make raoul work , so he takes his own way of employing himself . '' <EOS>	82.6379911723544
<SOS> `` exactly ; therefore i think of sending him away from here . '' <EOS>	99.66225772066292
<SOS> `` you will be wise to do so . '' <EOS>	82.59601059050216
<SOS> `` no doubt of it ; but it will break his heart . <EOS>	76.41441540804044
<SOS> so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol , whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here . <EOS>	66.71386540729681
<SOS> the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it ; now they begin to look concerned . '' <EOS>	58.92832243397511
<SOS> `` nonsense ! <EOS>	76.38413838431384
<SOS> however , raoul must be diverted from this fancy . <EOS>	94.6201278246659
<SOS> send him away or you will never make a man of him . '' <EOS>	67.68136028744384
<SOS> `` i think i shall send him to paris . '' <EOS>	76.47033712858256
<SOS> `` so ! '' <EOS>	69.19370747553897
<SOS> thought d'artagnan , and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived . <EOS>	69.73529102245324
<SOS> `` suppose , '' he said , `` we roughly chalk out a career for this young man . <EOS>	54.38382222497623
<SOS> i wish to consult you about some thing . '' <EOS>	103.8660067878565
<SOS> `` do so . '' <EOS>	76.93788450108127
<SOS> `` do you think it is time for us to enter the service ? '' <EOS>	90.51648799422502
<SOS> `` but are you not still in the service you , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	73.63311451978952
<SOS> `` i mean active service . <EOS>	84.87572553061649
<SOS> our former life , has it still no attractions for you ? <EOS>	79.42241976872295
<SOS> would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos , the exploits of our youth ? '' <EOS>	59.14226920265526
<SOS> `` do you propose to me to do so , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	115.73626870363098
<SOS> `` decidedly and honestly . '' <EOS>	82.78948854176585
<SOS> `` on whose side ? '' <EOS>	48.4033025560236
<SOS> asked athos , fixing his clear , benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon . <EOS>	51.60387231531658
<SOS> `` ah , devil take it , you speak in earnest `` `` and must have a definite answer . <EOS>	76.28798941067672
<SOS> listen , d'artagnan . <EOS>	76.34145673665901
<SOS> there is but one person , or rather , one cause , to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king . '' <EOS>	66.6462962188278
<SOS> `` exactly , '' answered the musketeer . <EOS>	58.559109078439974
<SOS> `` yes , but let us understand each other , '' returned athos , seriously . <EOS>	48.962657915994264
<SOS> `` if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin , we do not understand each other . '' <EOS>	79.85336918646405
<SOS> `` i do n't say exactly , '' answered the gascon , confused . <EOS>	113.20206993616094
<SOS> `` come , d'artagnan , do n't let us play a sidelong game ; your hesitation , your evasion , tells me at once on whose side you are ; for that party no one dares openly to recruit , and when people recruit for it , it is with averted eyes and humble voice . '' <EOS>	57.51707019428607

<SOS> `` you know that i am not alluding to you ; you are the pearl of brave , bold men . <EOS>	79.94118955650295
<SOS> i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison , not daring to kill them , as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser , who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear , though he is rich , of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen , as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us , in order that he may retain his pensions ; is that the master whom you propose to me ? <EOS>	49.762861252573735
<SOS> i thank you , d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	97.06134623328745

<SOS> devil take it , '' he muttered to himself , `` do n't let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them . '' <EOS>	51.37348810009318
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said athos , `` what are your schemes ? <EOS>	64.3741538728397
<SOS> what do you propose ? '' <EOS>	53.99137620845896
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	118.16708609503152

<SOS> porthos has , perhaps , sixty thousand francs income . <EOS>	78.67714441891897
<SOS> aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest , as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer ; but i what have i in the world ? <EOS>	83.32809996860425
<SOS> i have worn my cuirass these twenty years , kept down in this inferior rank , without going forward or backward , hardly half living . <EOS>	68.61619630442118

<SOS> i am of your opinion , but find me a better one or give me the means of living . '' <EOS>	96.86371828212586
<SOS> athos was for a few moments thoughtful . <EOS>	54.88784741388071
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	50.523373116592985
<SOS> d'artagnan is for mazarin , '' he said to himself . <EOS>	83.68020251508828
<SOS> from that moment he grew very guarded . <EOS>	121.54858559456031
<SOS> on his side d'artagnan became more cautious also . <EOS>	69.91296404383456
<SOS> `` you spoke to me , '' athos resumed , `` of porthos ; have you persuaded him to seek his fortune ? <EOS>	95.68017603881759
<SOS> but he has wealth , i believe , already . '' <EOS>	73.10466454593325
<SOS> `` doubtless he has . <EOS>	76.88448771900478

<SOS> `` what does porthos wish for ? '' <EOS>	73.38995466360906

<SOS> `` ah , true ! <EOS>	73.07444476022208

<SOS> `` 't is true ! '' <EOS>	84.30601743407023
<SOS> thought the gascon , `` where has he heard it ? <EOS>	89.25822475120287
<SOS> does he correspond with aramis ? <EOS>	102.19313453682165
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	50.39090839421046
<SOS> if i knew that he did i should know all . '' <EOS>	78.5431429415296
<SOS> the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul . <EOS>	40.14813588156529
<SOS> `` is our little neighbor worse ? '' <EOS>	64.34661357236493
<SOS> asked d'artagnan , seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth . <EOS>	108.08983716370254
<SOS> `` ah , sir ! '' <EOS>	58.311989528991575
<SOS> replied raoul , `` her fall is a very serious one , and without any ostensible injury , the physician fears she will be lame for life . '' <EOS>	80.49164440940318
<SOS> `` this is terrible , '' said athos . <EOS>	96.20625014171941
<SOS> `` and what makes me all the more wretched , sir , is , that i was the cause of this misfortune . '' <EOS>	55.46158777352096
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	52.241024110790065
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	71.44037247991423
<SOS> `` it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood . '' <EOS>	70.28683165855551
<SOS> `` there 's only one remedy , dear raoul that is , to marry her as a compensation . '' <EOS>	75.35874361090067
<SOS> remarked d'artagnan . <EOS>	105.13958311415234
<SOS> `` ah , sir ! '' <EOS>	86.34042105926609
<SOS> answered raoul , `` you joke about a real misfortune ; that is cruel , indeed . '' <EOS>	95.3791434002785
<SOS> the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the morning 's skirmish . <EOS>	70.951053380807
<SOS> they breakfasted with a good appetite , looking now and then at poor raoul , who with moist eyes and a full heart , scarcely ate at all . <EOS>	41.875829605583014
<SOS> after breakfast two letters arrived for athos , who read them with profound attention , whilst d'artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles , in one of which , there being at the time a very strong light , he perceived the fine writing of aramis . <EOS>	83.0903426536665
<SOS> the other was in a feminine hand , long , and crossed . <EOS>	86.54454912354905
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan to raoul , seeing that athos wished to be alone , `` come , let us take a turn in the fencing gallery ; that will amuse you . '' <EOS>	96.92969975456481
<SOS> and they both went into a low room where there were foils , gloves , masks , breastplates , and all the accessories for a fencing match . <EOS>	61.03765386026583
<SOS> in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d'artagnan , which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered . <EOS>	63.58570157783027
<SOS> it was now athos 's turn to take a sly look . <EOS>	96.84294768178498
<SOS> d'artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said , shaking his head : `` see , dear friend , what it is to belong to the army . <EOS>	98.13187658098495
<SOS> faith , you are indeed right not to return to it . <EOS>	49.44901499860645
<SOS> monsieur de tréville is ill , so my company ca n't do without me ; there ! <EOS>	85.92782133658001
<SOS> my leave is at an end ! '' <EOS>	56.850343906115036
<SOS> `` do you return to paris ? '' <EOS>	91.2487785288239
<SOS> asked athos , quickly . <EOS>	77.28328366759281
<SOS> `` egad ! <EOS>	115.73356604202623
<SOS> yes ; but why do n't you come there also ? '' <EOS>	50.36163733167642
<SOS> athos colored a little and answered : `` should i go , i shall be delighted to see you there . '' <EOS>	61.360832431009676
<SOS> `` halloo , planchet ! '' <EOS>	61.98253860126564
<SOS> cried the gascon from the door , `` we must set out in ten minutes ; give the horses some hay . '' <EOS>	57.93073019260495
<SOS> then turning to athos he added : `` i seem to miss something here . <EOS>	84.00888743788751
<SOS> i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud . '' <EOS>	60.975039625588934
<SOS> `` grimaud ! '' <EOS>	59.69566179327176
<SOS> replied athos . <EOS>	77.30048842088728
<SOS> `` i 'm surprised you have never so much as asked after him . <EOS>	105.41276857845591
<SOS> i have lent him to a friend `` `` who will understand the signs he makes ? '' <EOS>	64.17738789735637
<SOS> returned d'artagnan . <EOS>	84.77509582148824
<SOS> `` i hope so . '' <EOS>	63.61739583120457
<SOS> the friends embraced cordially ; d'artagnan pressed raoul 's hand . <EOS>	100.7260662651881
<SOS> `` will you not come with me ? '' <EOS>	70.82673045047181
<SOS> he said ; `` i shall pass by blois . '' <EOS>	62.64842088362403
<SOS> raoul turned toward athos , who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go . <EOS>	43.56281101633556
<SOS> `` no , monsieur , '' replied the young man ; `` i will remain with monsieur le comte . '' <EOS>	100.94217230526317
<SOS> `` adieu , then , to both , my good friends , '' said d'artagnan ; `` may god preserve you ! <EOS>	73.43033236931359
<SOS> as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal 's time . '' <EOS>	78.26633719793423
<SOS> athos waved his hand , raoul bowed , and d'artagnan and planchet set out . <EOS>	54.81172030986948
<SOS> the count followed them with his eyes , his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth , whose height was almost equal to his own ; but as soon as they were out of sight he said : `` raoul , we set out to night for paris . '' <EOS>	47.55424570578378
<SOS> `` eh ? '' <EOS>	76.76024479651785
<SOS> cried the young man , turning pale . <EOS>	94.23209500686707
<SOS> `` you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy . <EOS>	54.104835091556495
<SOS> i shall wait for you here till seven . '' <EOS>	87.84459790433075
<SOS> the young man bent low , with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled , and retired in order to saddle his horse . <EOS>	68.82607772658231
<SOS> as to d'artagnan , scarcely , on his side , was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter , which he read over again : `` return immediately to paris . <EOS>	73.5501875906097
<SOS> j. m . '' <EOS>	117.62410511691633
<SOS> `` the epistle is laconic , '' said d'artagnan ; `` and if there had not been a postscript , probably i should not have understood it ; but happily there is a postscript . '' <EOS>	67.56514895629041
<SOS> and he read that welcome postscript , which made him forget the abruptness of the letter . <EOS>	55.68831023438244
<SOS> `` p. s. go to the king 's treasurer , at blois ; tell him your name and show him this letter ; you will receive two hundred pistoles . '' <EOS>	44.09645372525457
<SOS> `` assuredly , '' said d'artagnan , `` i admire this piece of prose . <EOS>	102.350377895125
<SOS> the cardinal writes better than i thought . <EOS>	68.5025101260852
<SOS> come , planchet , let us pay a visit to the king 's treasurer and then set off . '' <EOS>	80.12537256114558
<SOS> `` toward paris , sir ? '' <EOS>	85.28384615853423
<SOS> `` toward paris . '' <EOS>	81.31830706801688
<SOS> and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain . <EOS>	105.45649487274723
<SOS> chapter xvi . <EOS>	48.41383917837248
<SOS> the duc de beaufort . <EOS>	83.99405727618917
<SOS> the circumstances that had hastened the return of d'artagnan to paris were as follows : one evening , when mazarin , according to custom , went to visit the queen , in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices ; wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing , he approached with his wonted wolf like step , pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink . <EOS>	61.8476262227694
<SOS> there was a dispute among the guards . <EOS>	78.14782578984604
<SOS> `` i tell you , '' one of them was saying , `` that if coysel predicted that , 't is as good as true ; i know nothing about it , but i have heard say that he 's not only an astrologer , but a magician . '' <EOS>	76.90025637064618
<SOS> `` deuce take it , friend , if he 's one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so . '' <EOS>	55.63043463128153
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	57.47031464341224
<SOS> `` because he may be tried for it . '' <EOS>	89.16202885452977
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	87.12639882694369
<SOS> absurd ! <EOS>	113.12591186400527
<SOS> they do n't burn sorcerers nowadays . '' <EOS>	103.91723531493736
<SOS> `` no ? <EOS>	90.72444463572766
<SOS> 't is not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier , though . '' <EOS>	121.38346160031057
<SOS> `` my friend , urban grandier was n't a sorcerer , he was a learned man . <EOS>	63.86929915545661
<SOS> he did n't predict the future , he knew the past often a more dangerous thing . '' <EOS>	45.42097249681388
<SOS> mazarin nodded an assent , but wishing to know what this prediction was , about which they disputed , he remained in the same place . <EOS>	44.593997120737534
<SOS> `` i do n't say , '' resumed the guard , `` that coysel is not a sorcerer , but i say that if his prophecy gets wind , it 's a sure way to prevent it 's coming true . '' <EOS>	52.09177929730217
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	58.02784718000218
<SOS> `` why , in this way : if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him , on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape , 't is plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape . '' <EOS>	65.36274508988475
<SOS> `` good lord ! '' <EOS>	74.59044297011933
<SOS> said another guard , who might have been thought asleep on a bench , but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation , `` do you suppose that men can escape their destiny ? <EOS>	60.36354051013332
<SOS> if it is written yonder , in heaven , that the duc de beaufort is to escape , he will escape ; and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it . '' <EOS>	103.03686986652691
<SOS> mazarin started . <EOS>	97.27001733510338
<SOS> he was an italian and therefore superstitious . <EOS>	75.17584293171889
<SOS> he walked straight into the midst of the guards , who on seeing him were silent . <EOS>	104.89955628728526
<SOS> `` what were you saying ? '' <EOS>	87.42828684594545
<SOS> he asked with his flattering manner ; `` that monsieur de beaufort had escaped , were you not ? '' <EOS>	107.729796943513
<SOS> `` oh , no , my lord ! '' <EOS>	57.516754611948826
<SOS> said the incredulous soldier . <EOS>	78.87793372171247
<SOS> `` he 's well guarded now ; we only said he would escape . '' <EOS>	107.65262853056943
<SOS> `` who said so ? '' <EOS>	66.31435637322234
<SOS> `` repeat your story , saint laurent , '' replied the man , turning to the originator of the tale . <EOS>	90.39822734621193
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said the guard , `` i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man named coysel , who believes that , be he ever so closely watched and guarded , the duke of beaufort will escape before whitsuntide . '' <EOS>	70.46267500807636
<SOS> `` coysel is a madman ! '' <EOS>	73.77723242771008
<SOS> returned the cardinal . <EOS>	72.23079261060438
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the soldier , tenacious in his credulity ; `` he has foretold many things which have come to pass ; for instance , that the queen would have a son ; that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise ; and finally , that the coadjutor would be made cardinal . <EOS>	81.75916974154504
<SOS> well ! <EOS>	64.64683616435475
<SOS> the queen has not only one son , but two ; then , monsieur de coligny was killed , and `` `` yes , '' said mazarin , `` but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal ! '' <EOS>	66.33147884758826
<SOS> `` no , my lord , but he will be , '' answered the guard . <EOS>	96.57958069064355
<SOS> mazarin made a grimace , as if he meant to say , `` but he does not wear the cardinal 's cap ; '' then he added : `` so , my friend , it 's your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape ? '' <EOS>	84.52099164951804
<SOS> `` that 's my idea , my lord ; and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes , i should refuse it . <EOS>	74.05130382993374
<SOS> after whitsuntide it would be another thing . '' <EOS>	75.58690006192174
<SOS> there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction . <EOS>	52.556203281945116
<SOS> it has its own effect upon the most incredulous ; and far from being incredulous , mazarin was superstitious . <EOS>	65.1654738740674
<SOS> he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room , where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive . <EOS>	108.36981151762208
<SOS> the guard had , in fact , touched the cardinal in the tenderest point . <EOS>	56.201989721714696
<SOS> during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape . <EOS>	46.65356788329549
<SOS> it was not possible , as he knew well , to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv. , especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age . <EOS>	109.37333251683238
<SOS> but however and whensoever he did escape , what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment ; who had taken him , rich , brave , glorious , beloved by women , feared by men , to cut off his life 's best , happiest years ; for it is not life , it is merely existence , in prison ! <EOS>	63.56599848383688
<SOS> meantime , mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke . <EOS>	66.00891509869378
<SOS> but like the miser in the fable , he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure . <EOS>	105.72752865419642
<SOS> often he awoke in the night , suddenly , dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort . <EOS>	76.81332730927497
<SOS> then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played , drank , sang , but that whilst playing , drinking , singing , he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes . <EOS>	70.82773833846183
<SOS> so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep , that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him , his first words were : `` well , what 's the matter ? <EOS>	80.73168215168047
<SOS> has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes ? '' <EOS>	115.1944397766084
<SOS> `` i do not think so , my lord , '' said bernouin ; `` but you will hear about him , for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence . '' <EOS>	52.84291435933018
<SOS> `` tell him to come in , '' said mazarin , arranging his pillows , so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed . <EOS>	93.38829215563152
<SOS> the officer entered , a large fat man , with an open physiognomy . <EOS>	60.22606275392156
<SOS> his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy . <EOS>	64.65684153488633
<SOS> `` approach , sir , '' said the cardinal . <EOS>	79.57548317949441
<SOS> the officer obeyed . <EOS>	96.27470875503977
<SOS> `` do you know what they are saying here ? '' <EOS>	51.98215332786752
<SOS> `` no , your eminence . '' <EOS>	97.49669648879072
<SOS> `` well , they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes , if he has not done so already . '' <EOS>	114.66318072086659
<SOS> the officer 's face expressed complete stupefaction . <EOS>	77.08495459948968
<SOS> he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth , to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him , and ended by a burst of laughter , so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague . <EOS>	73.37075367905885
<SOS> `` escape ! <EOS>	47.769299156326475
<SOS> my lord escape ! <EOS>	105.79799742107934
<SOS> your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is ? '' <EOS>	94.58243642107355
<SOS> `` yes , i do , sir ; in the donjon of vincennes . '' <EOS>	55.82852659647344
<SOS> `` yes , sir ; in a room , the walls of which are seven feet thick , with grated windows , each bar as thick as my arm . '' <EOS>	91.16588442694642
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied mazarin , `` with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall ; with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar . '' <EOS>	78.61025427504954

<SOS> `` but he leaves his room , he plays at tennis at the mall ? '' <EOS>	113.48717607696271
<SOS> `` sir , those amusements are allowed ; but if your eminence wishes it , we will discontinue the permission . '' <EOS>	58.38876417242956
<SOS> `` no , no ! '' <EOS>	68.31676206371826
<SOS> cried mazarin , fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement . <EOS>	60.087667232259406
<SOS> he then asked with whom he played . <EOS>	73.80057437898226
<SOS> `` my lord , either with the officers of the guard , with the other prisoners , or with me . '' <EOS>	63.27808271309737

<SOS> `` your eminence does n't know those walls ; they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off . '' <EOS>	82.26669992999857
<SOS> `` hum ! '' <EOS>	62.50223597141071
<SOS> said the cardinal , beginning to feel more comfortable . <EOS>	66.20051290195978
<SOS> `` you mean to say , then , my dear monsieur la ramee `` `` that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird , i will continue answerable for him . '' <EOS>	109.05431746741422
<SOS> `` take care ! <EOS>	66.5096080175939
<SOS> you assert a great deal , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	48.76651172758218
<SOS> `` monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison , and that he had found out forty ways of escaping . '' <EOS>	84.9149956222703

<SOS> `` come , come ; not such a fool as i fancied ! '' <EOS>	83.91064869242079
<SOS> thought mazarin . <EOS>	72.61853523383573
<SOS> `` besides , my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes , '' continued la ramee , `` and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort . '' <EOS>	95.8888803059824
<SOS> `` yes , but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent . '' <EOS>	74.22207272770024

<SOS> i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner . <EOS>	98.80039737114991
<SOS> during the three weeks that he has been with me , i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners . '' <EOS>	57.971473430954106
<SOS> `` and who is this cerberus ? '' <EOS>	93.02137938296731
<SOS> `` a certain monsieur grimaud , my lord . '' <EOS>	63.49674063514177
<SOS> `` and what was he before he went to vincennes ? '' <EOS>	107.96606996122406
<SOS> `` he was in the country , as i was told by the person who recommended him to me . '' <EOS>	68.10953760540058

<SOS> `` the steward of the duc de grammont . '' <EOS>	46.982104599566135
<SOS> `` he is not a gossip , i hope ? '' <EOS>	73.97956094194684
<SOS> `` lord a mercy , my lord ! <EOS>	45.64723234656027
<SOS> i thought for a long time that he was dumb ; he answers only by signs . <EOS>	61.45758753407315
<SOS> it seems his former master accustomed him to that . '' <EOS>	78.10769479155675
<SOS> `` well , dear monsieur la ramee , '' replied the cardinal `` let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable , and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king 's health . '' <EOS>	59.39360341546344
<SOS> mazarin was large in promises , quite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so bepraised by la ramee ; for he said nothing and did much . <EOS>	67.47274579505414
<SOS> it was now nine o'clock . <EOS>	74.92170302642268
<SOS> the cardinal , therefore , got up , perfumed himself , dressed , and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him . <EOS>	59.64735817631873
<SOS> the queen , who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself , and who was almost as superstitious as he was , made him repeat word for word all la ramee 's praises of his deputy . <EOS>	75.7132400789008
<SOS> then , when the cardinal had ended : `` alas , sir ! <EOS>	82.85722186704395
<SOS> why have we not a grimaud near every prince ? '' <EOS>	65.92038368118742
<SOS> `` patience ! '' <EOS>	52.74539743236189
<SOS> replied mazarin , with his italian smile ; `` that may happen one day ; but in the meantime `` `` well , in the meantime ? '' <EOS>	79.57844747141795
<SOS> `` i shall still take precautions . '' <EOS>	95.17447350835036
<SOS> and he wrote to d'artagnan to hasten his return . <EOS>	87.085510152262
<SOS> chapter xvii . <EOS>	110.63909198653604
<SOS> duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes . <EOS>	120.05880698672188
<SOS> the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court , was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal . <EOS>	98.79518770677367
<SOS> he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape . <EOS>	58.81991445586342
<SOS> his vengeance , therefore , consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin ; he even tried to make some verses on him , but soon gave up the attempt , for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying , he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose . <EOS>	39.24783352256759
<SOS> the duke was the grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	92.1307401064311
<SOS> and gabrielle d'estrees as good natured , as brave , as proud , and above all , as gascon as his ancestor , but less elaborately educated . <EOS>	68.26762254330593
<SOS> after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii . <EOS>	65.58952257387303
<SOS> the favorite , the confidant , the first man , in short , at the court , he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor ; and eventually , as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position , the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant , who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again . <EOS>	53.92273205051876
<SOS> it is understood , of course , that when we say `` the queen , '' mazarin is meant . <EOS>	79.2975154917648
<SOS> during the five years of this seclusion , which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man , m. de beaufort , had he not affected to brave the cardinal , despise princes , and walk alone without adherents or disciples , would either have regained his liberty or made partisans . <EOS>	77.86390667697167
<SOS> but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister . <EOS>	53.637582320245926
<SOS> after having failed in poetry , monsieur de beaufort tried drawing . <EOS>	99.7434131463917
<SOS> he drew portraits , with a piece of coal , of the cardinal ; and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness , he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original : `` portrait of the illustrious coxcomb , mazarin . '' <EOS>	85.18671496321426
<SOS> monsieur de chavigny , the governor of vincennes , waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way , or that at all events , if he drew likenesses , he would not put mottoes underneath them . <EOS>	43.896603842686645
<SOS> the next day the prisoner 's room was full of pictures and mottoes . <EOS>	78.42608270993846
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort , in common with many other prisoners , was bent upon doing things that were prohibited ; and the only resource the governor had was , one day when the duke was playing at tennis , to efface all these drawings , consisting chiefly of profiles . <EOS>	85.44697730673046
<SOS> m. de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal 's fat face . <EOS>	91.40295095673598
<SOS> the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having , as he said , cleaned his drawing paper for him ; he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin 's life . <EOS>	88.6767320041532
<SOS> in one was depicted the `` illustrious coxcomb '' receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio , whose servant he had been ; another , the `` illustrious mazarin '' acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name ; a third , the `` illustrious mazarin '' stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny , who had expected to have it ; a fourth , the `` illustrious coxcomb mazarin '' refusing to give laporte , the young king 's valet , clean sheets , and saving that `` it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months . '' <EOS>	39.79232426059727
<SOS> the governor , of course , thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner . <EOS>	102.73393684441682
<SOS> to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him , he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts ; since he could not be a bayard , he would become a raphael or a michael angelo . <EOS>	64.86657756240119
<SOS> nevertheless , one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out , his charcoal all removed , taken away ; and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed . <EOS>	54.07394019205883
<SOS> the poor duke swore , fell into a rage , yelled , and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome ; but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter . <EOS>	75.28411505618723
<SOS> his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers . <EOS>	63.29744881831783
<SOS> with this animal , which he called pistache , he was often shut up for hours alone , superintending , as every one supposed , its education . <EOS>	79.8160822531464
<SOS> at last , when pistache was sufficiently well trained , monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment . <EOS>	78.15085388354252
<SOS> the party assembled , the room was lighted with waxlights , and the prisoner , with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room , had traced a long white line , representing a cord , on the floor . <EOS>	47.49223075438773
<SOS> pistache , on a signal from his master , placed himself on this line , raised himself on his hind paws , and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten , he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer . <EOS>	69.10939444875544
<SOS> having been several times up and down it , he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again . <EOS>	80.65958613335168
<SOS> the intelligent creature was received with loud applause . <EOS>	61.40922724420644
<SOS> the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o'clock it was ; he was shown monsieur de chavigny 's watch ; it was then half past six ; the dog raised and dropped his paw six times ; the seventh he let it remain upraised . <EOS>	80.78336100321084
<SOS> nothing could be better done ; a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision . <EOS>	57.391606126490196
<SOS> then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france . <EOS>	65.96743160851132
<SOS> the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself , with the deepest respect , at the feet of monsieur de chavigny , who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud , but a frown succeeded , and he bit his lips with vexation . <EOS>	75.88452498253157
<SOS> then the duke put to pistache this difficult question , who was the greatest thief in the world ? <EOS>	66.11198302505879
<SOS> pistache went again around the circle , but stopped at no one , and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark . <EOS>	80.0536901582992
<SOS> `` see , gentlemen , '' said m. de beaufort , `` this wonderful animal , not finding here what i ask for , seeks it out of doors ; you shall , however , have his answer . <EOS>	85.32511643563704
<SOS> pistache , my friend , come here . <EOS>	82.4002216186313
<SOS> is not the greatest thief in the world , monsieur ( the king 's secretary ) le camus , who came to paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions ? '' <EOS>	88.44924987377956
<SOS> the dog shook his head . <EOS>	69.7135918362053
<SOS> `` then is it not , '' resumed the duke , `` the superintendent emery , who gave his son , when he was married , three hundred thousand francs and a house , compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building ? '' <EOS>	82.53034537111928
<SOS> the dog again shook his head as if to say `` no . '' <EOS>	84.11010750019898
<SOS> `` then , '' said the prisoner , `` let 's think who it can be . <EOS>	105.75961342635047
<SOS> can it be , can it possibly be , the 'illustrious coxcomb , mazarin de piscina , ' hey ? '' <EOS>	83.51330527895134
<SOS> pistache made violent signs that it was , by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively . <EOS>	79.8779830332753
<SOS> `` gentlemen , you see , '' said the duke to those present , who dared not even smile , `` that it is the 'illustrious coxcomb ' who is the greatest thief in the world ; at least , according to pistache . '' <EOS>	43.81515203045134
<SOS> `` let us go on to another of his exercises . '' <EOS>	113.56711207314648
<SOS> `` gentlemen ! '' <EOS>	76.39004302494853
<SOS> there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them `` do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons , whom he styled 'the fairest of the fair ? ' <EOS>	98.71139951001244
<SOS> pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs . <EOS>	69.33567137907312
<SOS> monsieur de chavigny , be so good as to lend me your cane . '' <EOS>	85.16378507469696
<SOS> monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort . <EOS>	78.17500944062253
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot . <EOS>	78.48794504686784
<SOS> `` now , pistache , my good dog , jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon . '' <EOS>	55.13447994554993
<SOS> `` but , '' interposed monsieur de chavigny , `` it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons . '' <EOS>	57.89789162372598
<SOS> `` stop , '' said the duke , `` pistache , jump for the queen . '' <EOS>	72.03918818917651
<SOS> and he raised his cane six inches higher . <EOS>	73.5101554983344
<SOS> the dog sprang , and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it . <EOS>	81.17041623891068
<SOS> `` and now , '' said the duke , raising it still six inches higher , `` jump for the king . '' <EOS>	74.81467396850742
<SOS> the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane . <EOS>	72.10283252404557
<SOS> `` now , then , '' said the duke , and as he spoke , lowered the cane almost level with the ground ; `` pistache , my friend , jump for the 'illustrious coxcomb , mazarin de piscina . ' '' <EOS>	74.51283955572615
<SOS> the dog turned his back to the cane . <EOS>	60.52933476627597
<SOS> `` what , '' asked the duke , `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	83.78740720335693
<SOS> and he gave him the cane again , first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache . <EOS>	81.7619406035073
<SOS> `` jump then , monsieur pistache . '' <EOS>	84.15525670268104
<SOS> but pistache , as at first , turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane . <EOS>	95.41901253367331
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time , but by this time pistache 's patience was exhausted ; he threw himself furiously upon the cane , wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth . <EOS>	78.20519347640925
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny , saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended , but in three months it should be repeated , when pistache would have learned a few new tricks . <EOS>	79.68034574064004
<SOS> three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned . <EOS>	68.86327197646884
<SOS> then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him ; and one day after dinner he went to bed , calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him . <EOS>	88.18228480253566
<SOS> this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly . <EOS>	79.42155553604661
<SOS> the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success . <EOS>	77.15735998139695
<SOS> so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted , and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster . <EOS>	80.1342884266258
<SOS> every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache . <EOS>	55.039664057540605
<SOS> de chavigny , who , according to report , was a son of richelieu 's , and had been a creature of the late cardinal 's , understood tyranny . <EOS>	89.0723608528987
<SOS> he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks , pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes , he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide . <EOS>	62.02576786411141
<SOS> a fortnight afterward the duke , going to the tennis court , found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside ; he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day . <EOS>	85.10857412353704
<SOS> one morning the gardener went to him and told him , as if to please him , that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use . <EOS>	77.67751437271312
<SOS> now , since , as every one knows , asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection , this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort . <EOS>	116.62052216253436
<SOS> at last his patience was exhausted . <EOS>	103.70641271102863
<SOS> he assembled his keepers , and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance , addressed them as follows : `` gentlemen ! <EOS>	47.558731535539934
<SOS> will you permit a grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	60.69492855159205
<SOS> to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy ? <EOS>	78.04464330219041
<SOS> `` odds fish ! <EOS>	64.01211572822697
<SOS> as my grandfather used to say , i once reigned in paris ! <EOS>	55.0670031796429
<SOS> do you know that ? <EOS>	49.94924000050993
<SOS> i had the king and monsieur the whole of one day in my care . <EOS>	80.88205608518875
<SOS> the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom . <EOS>	108.83586727184895
<SOS> gentlemen and citizens , set me free ; i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin . <EOS>	96.44554242922852
<SOS> you shall be my body guard . <EOS>	86.46212881983065
<SOS> i will make you all captains , with good pensions ! <EOS>	83.0136625071429
<SOS> odds fish ! <EOS>	58.08574831036905
<SOS> on ! <EOS>	103.20670685947998
<SOS> march forward ! '' <EOS>	92.16290858533308
<SOS> but eloquent as he might be , the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	72.90759824891524
<SOS> did not touch those hearts of stone ; not one man stirred , so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun . <EOS>	61.39268520674295
<SOS> sometimes , when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit , the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians , all fully armed , appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison . <EOS>	75.6304167238069
<SOS> `` my lord , '' answered de chavigny , with a low bow , `` i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns . <EOS>	58.808917954418305
<SOS> i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded . '' <EOS>	64.14282926176789
<SOS> `` yes , but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon ; the donjon being taken , i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy , certainly . '' <EOS>	77.35195536878807
<SOS> and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny . <EOS>	83.85866813627152
<SOS> `` for myself , on the other hand , my lord , '' returned the governor , `` when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand , since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up , dead or alive . '' <EOS>	71.82434334232371
<SOS> and once more he bowed low before his highness . <EOS>	93.75476312334055
<SOS> these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes , sometimes longer , but always finished thus : monsieur de chavigny , turning toward the door , used to call out : `` halloo ! <EOS>	52.80650427535234
<SOS> la ramee ! '' <EOS>	76.08884724394107
<SOS> la ramee came into the room . <EOS>	63.904848237088444
<SOS> `` la ramee , i recommend monsieur le duc to you , particularly ; treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated ; that is , never leave him alone an instant . '' <EOS>	73.83679401993537
<SOS> la ramee became , therefore , the duke 's dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper , the shadow of his person ; but la ramee gay , frank , convivial , fond of play , a great hand at tennis , had one defect in the duke 's eyes his incorruptibility . <EOS>	82.74076091029971
<SOS> now , although la ramee appreciated , as of a certain value , the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance , still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	49.053409331516306
<SOS> hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family . <EOS>	58.62279196827816
<SOS> one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband . <EOS>	77.77229444120594
<SOS> la ramee adored his wife and children , whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall , when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat . <EOS>	93.72458615723103
<SOS> 't was too brief an enjoyment , and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health ( of which it was perhaps rather the result ) would not long survive such a mode of life . <EOS>	98.13120940069797
<SOS> he accepted , therefore , with delight , an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont , to give him a substitute ; he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny , who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is , if he approved of the person proposed . <EOS>	63.09221417130324
<SOS> we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud ; if , as we hope , our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work , they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual , who is wholly unchanged , except that he is twenty years older , an advance in life that has made him only more silent ; although , since the change that had been working in himself , athos had given grimaud permission to speak . <EOS>	82.34719988131937
<SOS> but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence , and a habit of fifteen or twenty years ' duration becomes second nature . <EOS>	52.92518673621873
<SOS> chapter xviii . <EOS>	70.20800170144034
<SOS> grimaud begins his functions . <EOS>	62.54296990633083
<SOS> grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes . <EOS>	64.70271363413018
<SOS> now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration ; for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension ; he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows , thin lips , hooked nose , and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs . <EOS>	70.56968951731015
<SOS> he addressed about twelve words to him ; grimaud answered in four . <EOS>	81.22505078959605
<SOS> `` here 's a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits , '' said monsieur de chavigny . <EOS>	69.61144807804344
<SOS> `` go , '' he added , `` and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee , and tell him that you suit me in all respects . '' <EOS>	48.504791361471526
<SOS> grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy . <EOS>	117.15240600959056
<SOS> so , after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply , la ramee , fascinated by this sobriety in speech , rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud . <EOS>	68.174902930834
<SOS> `` my orders ? '' <EOS>	94.66705252842655
<SOS> asked grimaud . <EOS>	82.9440014768874
<SOS> `` they are these ; never to leave the prisoner alone ; to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument , and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers . '' <EOS>	75.29722330972581
<SOS> `` those are all ? '' <EOS>	77.03163731611274
<SOS> asked grimaud . <EOS>	87.09754830208658
<SOS> `` all now , '' replied la ramee . <EOS>	87.35522017468455
<SOS> `` good , '' answered grimaud ; and he went right to the prisoner . <EOS>	101.3600160214102
<SOS> the duke was in the act of combing his beard , which he had allowed to grow , as well as his hair , in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition . <EOS>	60.893229291188185
<SOS> but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage , and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman , he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin , and in the hope of seeing her again , had asked for a leaden comb , which was allowed him . <EOS>	78.21415663500797
<SOS> the comb was to be a leaden one , because his beard , like that of most fair people , was rather red ; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it . <EOS>	71.43349155724353
<SOS> as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table ; he took it up , and as he took it he made a low bow . <EOS>	73.18984227268024
<SOS> the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise . <EOS>	58.69312370201078
<SOS> the figure put the comb in its pocket . <EOS>	87.47488992220175
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	117.64281213557175
<SOS> hey ! <EOS>	51.818410361709944
<SOS> what 's that ? '' <EOS>	66.33219491898059
<SOS> cried the duke . <EOS>	73.18809546500324
<SOS> `` who is this creature ? '' <EOS>	85.8048976026445
<SOS> grimaud did not answer , but bowed a second time . <EOS>	64.70653715683578
<SOS> `` art thou dumb ? '' <EOS>	44.04991981519957
<SOS> cried the duke . <EOS>	99.47172590375477
<SOS> grimaud made a sign that he was not . <EOS>	74.83785176374406
<SOS> `` what art thou , then ? <EOS>	57.86892677088477
<SOS> answer ! <EOS>	53.875643522361536
<SOS> i command thee ! '' <EOS>	44.92802361558624
<SOS> said the duke . <EOS>	108.52672524753109
<SOS> `` a keeper , '' replied grimaud . <EOS>	72.39616869322711
<SOS> `` a keeper ! '' <EOS>	74.23749917877493
<SOS> reiterated the duke ; `` there was nothing wanting in my collection , except this gallows bird . <EOS>	86.64169141587719
<SOS> halloo ! <EOS>	45.91091039785392
<SOS> la ramee ! <EOS>	115.43563313080823
<SOS> some one ! '' <EOS>	68.51023053260586
<SOS> la ramee ran in haste to obey the call . <EOS>	71.85668807477947
<SOS> `` who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket ? '' <EOS>	80.62012340574063
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	88.25787181014127
<SOS> `` one of your guards , my prince ; a man of talent and merit , whom you will like , as i and monsieur de chavigny do , i am sure . '' <EOS>	92.1189485708082
<SOS> `` why does he take my comb ? '' <EOS>	59.27250914557333
<SOS> `` why do you take my lord 's comb ? '' <EOS>	80.84109269241853
<SOS> asked la ramee . <EOS>	112.90815618472742
<SOS> grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth , pronounced this one word , `` pointed . '' <EOS>	53.17751746286003
<SOS> `` true , '' said la ramee . <EOS>	43.130811512161074
<SOS> `` what does the animal say ? '' <EOS>	90.84940730518555
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	68.20762749751904
<SOS> `` that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument . '' <EOS>	90.65342393285118
<SOS> `` are you mad , la ramee ? <EOS>	81.88314491476368
<SOS> you yourself gave me this comb . '' <EOS>	65.76348977740834
<SOS> `` i was very wrong , my lord , for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders . '' <EOS>	106.9667300783767
<SOS> the duke looked furiously at grimaud . <EOS>	76.32201707251986
<SOS> `` i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion , '' he muttered . <EOS>	68.06310067700534
<SOS> grimaud , nevertheless , was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner ; he wanted to inspire , not a sudden repugnance , but a good , sound , steady hatred ; he retired , therefore , and gave place to four guards , who , having breakfasted , could attend on the prisoner . <EOS>	53.31978810731934
<SOS> a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke . <EOS>	89.65549368661625
<SOS> he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning ; he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish . <EOS>	96.27840935111794
<SOS> the day was employed in preparations for the execution . <EOS>	115.20693740623688
<SOS> every one grows childish in prison , but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so . <EOS>	55.81488980553387
<SOS> in the course of his morning 's walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass , a discovery that quite delighted him . <EOS>	39.259548425632346
<SOS> when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop . <EOS>	59.72427569445472
<SOS> nothing of all this escaped grimaud , but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children . <EOS>	74.90519964293362
<SOS> the guards looked on it with indifference . <EOS>	79.64794050031784
<SOS> when everything was ready , the gallows hung in the middle of the room , the loop made , and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish , in order to select the finest specimen among them , he looked around for his piece of glass ; it had disappeared . <EOS>	69.7860055226311
<SOS> `` who has taken my piece of glass ? '' <EOS>	81.24307375291107
<SOS> asked the duke , frowning . <EOS>	57.65118294560312
<SOS> grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so . <EOS>	76.02924921121924
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	78.20307537917613
<SOS> thou again ! <EOS>	99.13378738351287
<SOS> why didst thou take it ? '' <EOS>	107.68536200880698
<SOS> `` yes why ? '' <EOS>	52.543061215039984
<SOS> asked la ramee . <EOS>	93.37492838778117
<SOS> grimaud , who held the piece of glass in his hand , said : `` sharp . '' <EOS>	63.658826204481194
<SOS> `` true , my lord ! '' <EOS>	66.03457776642297
<SOS> exclaimed la ramee . <EOS>	117.90955256720933
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	77.0180798739157
<SOS> deuce take it ! <EOS>	115.88144660180554
<SOS> we have a precious fellow here ! '' <EOS>	102.82559519108068
<SOS> `` monsieur grimaud ! '' <EOS>	73.29345610469741
<SOS> said the duke , `` for your sake i beg of you , never come within the reach of my fist ! '' <EOS>	63.39180190858973
<SOS> `` hush ! <EOS>	79.58666319889718
<SOS> hush ! '' <EOS>	67.11013573895173
<SOS> cried la ramee , `` give me your gibbet , my lord . <EOS>	77.33859648544615
<SOS> i will shape it out for you with my knife . '' <EOS>	77.665875214735
<SOS> and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible . <EOS>	63.87246124995626
<SOS> `` that 's it , '' said the duke , `` now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit . '' <EOS>	77.89075465703185
<SOS> la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor ; meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread . <EOS>	73.78420069905209
<SOS> then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room , bursting with laughter . <EOS>	69.04276137327902
<SOS> la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus ; grimaud , however , did not even smile . <EOS>	73.88843118087277
<SOS> he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread : `` cardinal , '' he said . <EOS>	88.88012809226473
<SOS> `` hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort ! '' <EOS>	95.27408409061994
<SOS> cried the prisoner , laughing violently , `` and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee , the king 's commissioner . '' <EOS>	101.74621527782644
<SOS> la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet , which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window . <EOS>	75.1524181053265
<SOS> he was going to throw the crawfish out also , when grimaud snatched it from his hands . <EOS>	107.82997575047241
<SOS> `` good to eat ! '' <EOS>	66.64824531289294
<SOS> he said , and put it in his pocket . <EOS>	44.433559896290774
<SOS> this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it ; but on reflection he hated him more and more , being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct . <EOS>	44.917918334083595
<SOS> but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside . <EOS>	95.58389775130964
<SOS> monsieur de chavigny , who at heart detested the cardinal , took pains to tell the story to two or three friends , who put it into immediate circulation . <EOS>	77.26472375166938
<SOS> the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance ; and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him . <EOS>	40.5718911759522
<SOS> one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him , when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully , but took the guard by the arm . <EOS>	56.32213845706331
<SOS> `` go away , '' he said . <EOS>	90.94114207561172
<SOS> the guard obeyed . <EOS>	67.40083147151495
<SOS> `` you are insupportable ! '' <EOS>	55.75962414355989
<SOS> cried the duke ; `` i shall beat you . '' <EOS>	43.14662348823522
<SOS> grimaud bowed . <EOS>	67.6833971397153
<SOS> `` i will break every bone in your body ! '' <EOS>	61.90713517305352
<SOS> cried the duke . <EOS>	57.342884741093684
<SOS> grimaud bowed , but stepped back . <EOS>	75.67243031844956
<SOS> `` mr. spy , '' cried the duke , more and more enraged , `` i will strangle you with my own hands . '' <EOS>	100.82903333927113
<SOS> and he extended his hands toward grimaud , who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him . <EOS>	94.59312241080262
<SOS> at the same time he felt the duke 's arms on his shoulders like two iron claws ; but instead either of calling out or defending himself , he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone : `` hush ! '' <EOS>	101.04668009177715
<SOS> smiling as he uttered the word . <EOS>	71.59751647565739
<SOS> a gesture , a smile and a word from grimaud , all at once , were so unusual that his highness stopped short , astounded . <EOS>	67.8311572938771
<SOS> grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal , and presented it to the duke without a word . <EOS>	61.89190623054971
<SOS> the duke , more and more bewildered , let grimaud loose and took the note . <EOS>	84.99065498961139
<SOS> `` from madame de montbazon ? '' <EOS>	62.45421617969884
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	70.58053014154031
<SOS> grimaud nodded assent . <EOS>	81.46804166684056
<SOS> the duke tore open the note , passed his hands over his eyes , for he was dazzled and confused , and read : `` my dear duke , you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note ; he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you , in order to prepare and assist your escape , which we are contriving . <EOS>	91.13907203428062
<SOS> the moment of your deliverance is at hand ; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained . <EOS>	75.0887899450214
<SOS> `` yours wholly and most affectionately `` marie de montbazon . <EOS>	75.74492501801947
<SOS> `` p.s . <EOS>	81.00319685589425
<SOS> i sign my full name , for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials . '' <EOS>	88.30064301844796
<SOS> the poor duke became perfectly giddy . <EOS>	60.39421187603283
<SOS> what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant , a friend , a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least . <EOS>	69.11945114989614
<SOS> `` oh , dearest marie ! <EOS>	65.69993790083436
<SOS> she thinks of me , then , after five years of separation ! <EOS>	52.87607381668404
<SOS> heavens ! <EOS>	102.56114703136188
<SOS> there is constancy ! '' <EOS>	50.58120744598368
<SOS> then turning to grimaud , he said : `` and thou , my brave fellow , thou consentest thus to aid me ? '' <EOS>	72.64943966375019
<SOS> grimaud signified his assent . <EOS>	100.86212016578992
<SOS> `` and you have come here with that purpose ? '' <EOS>	100.7474425486167
<SOS> grimaud repeated the sign . <EOS>	69.26775962178512
<SOS> `` and i was ready to strangle you ! '' <EOS>	61.49140687246509
<SOS> cried the duke . <EOS>	58.51635592725642
<SOS> grimaud smiled . <EOS>	55.197695664762755
<SOS> `` wait , then , '' said the duke , fumbling in his pocket . <EOS>	82.74664410096436
<SOS> `` wait , '' he continued , renewing his fruitless search ; `` it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv . <EOS>	102.8270678577483
<SOS> went without recompense . '' <EOS>	58.95303304904066
<SOS> the duke 's endeavors evinced the best intention in the world , but one of the precautions taken at vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money . <EOS>	57.982107644310645
<SOS> whereupon grimaud , observing the duke 's disappointment , drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him . <EOS>	63.20392434595085
<SOS> `` here is what you are looking for , '' he said . <EOS>	66.18057515119683
<SOS> the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud 's hands , but grimaud shook his head . <EOS>	63.825861407851086
<SOS> `` thank you , monseigneur , '' he said , drawing back ; `` i am paid . '' <EOS>	102.23254928449394
<SOS> the duke went from one surprise to another . <EOS>	99.2540765515181
<SOS> he held out his hand . <EOS>	59.91371112112766
<SOS> grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully . <EOS>	97.46405015504185
<SOS> the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud . <EOS>	42.48683048266324
<SOS> `` what shall we do ? <EOS>	60.17486271446202
<SOS> and when ? <EOS>	104.25683596206893
<SOS> and how proceed ? '' <EOS>	70.16363916358843
<SOS> `` it is now eleven , '' answered grimaud . <EOS>	56.03039977438068
<SOS> `` let my lord at two o'clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts . '' <EOS>	64.57148090756901
<SOS> `` and then ? '' <EOS>	84.2162131188096
<SOS> `` your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again . '' <EOS>	76.90092627429026
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said the duke . <EOS>	72.66186297818008
<SOS> grimaud made a sign that he was going away . <EOS>	82.77931272637719
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	61.761915472570905
<SOS> cried the duke , `` will you not accept any money from me ? '' <EOS>	41.19005845751443
<SOS> `` i wish my lord would make me one promise . '' <EOS>	72.54810128169967
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	58.782462672963874
<SOS> speak ! '' <EOS>	103.23301126624347
<SOS> `` 't is this : when we escape together , that i shall go everywhere and be always first ; for if my lord should be overtaken and caught , there 's every chance of his being brought back to prison , whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung . '' <EOS>	86.46619685184362
<SOS> `` true , on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest . '' <EOS>	58.22651417881655
<SOS> `` now , '' resumed grimaud , `` i 've only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me . '' <EOS>	67.80339819661532
<SOS> `` i 'll try , '' said the duke . <EOS>	85.92126040256534
<SOS> at this moment la ramee , after the interview we have described with the cardinal , entered the room . <EOS>	54.851098519684165
<SOS> the duke had thrown himself , as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation , on his bed . <EOS>	99.83897336560179
<SOS> la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction . <EOS>	84.95912837263445
<SOS> then turning to grimaud : `` very good , my friend , very good . <EOS>	48.84370045690578

<SOS> grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew , as was his custom on the entrance of his superior . <EOS>	74.51033782412874
<SOS> `` well , my lord , '' said la ramee , with his rude laugh , `` you still set yourself against this poor fellow ? '' <EOS>	73.45734065795276
<SOS> `` so ! <EOS>	57.94281679994059
<SOS> 't is you , la ramee ; in faith , 't is time you came back again . <EOS>	102.34088206661714
<SOS> i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall , that i might n't break my promise and strangle grimaud . '' <EOS>	66.17800875928287

<SOS> `` yes , '' continued the duke , `` really , i feel bored today beyond the power of description . '' <EOS>	73.17165615900258

<SOS> `` i admit the word , monseigneur , because it rhymes with ministre [ minister ] . <EOS>	104.07254425215905

<SOS> asked the duke uneasily . <EOS>	76.59135734780675
<SOS> `` because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape . '' <EOS>	60.73644833346772

<SOS> an astrologer predicted that ? '' <EOS>	91.03846531816298

<SOS> `` oh , mon dieu ! <EOS>	83.40000671344883
<SOS> yes ! <EOS>	71.04487754232943
<SOS> those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people . '' <EOS>	68.50708810745928
<SOS> `` and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence ? '' <EOS>	59.54557214783685
<SOS> `` that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one . '' <EOS>	82.90200677125436
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	49.20051631326651
<SOS> `` because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird . '' <EOS>	75.49184549311391
<SOS> `` unfortunately , that is true . <EOS>	56.95651771946741

<SOS> `` my lord i beg your highness 's pardon but i must beg for half an hour 's leave of absence . '' <EOS>	76.67914725754463
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	72.9552110168266
<SOS> `` because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness , though not of such high birth : he forgot to ask me to breakfast . '' <EOS>	51.058201329079374
<SOS> `` well , shall i send for some breakfast here ? '' <EOS>	86.67323989457651
<SOS> `` no , my lord ; i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle daddy marteau , as they called him `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	87.96199454956826
<SOS> `` well , he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris , an invalid , ordered country air for his health . '' <EOS>	75.36646375340169

<SOS> `` why , good lord ! <EOS>	54.9903173531793
<SOS> this man , your highness , when he saw me stop before his shop , where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water , my lord , asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon . <EOS>	67.39989102672568
<SOS> ' i bought , ' said he , 'the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle ; whereas , on my honor , monsieur de chavigny , though i 've been here a week , has not ordered so much as a tartlet . ' <EOS>	66.12956756810922
<SOS> 'but , ' i then replied , 'probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good . ' <EOS>	91.05179757343413
<SOS> 'my pastry not good ! <EOS>	65.77055675000608
<SOS> well , monsieur la ramee , you shall judge of it yourself and at once . ' <EOS>	110.94954001810228
<SOS> ' i can not , ' i replied ; 'it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau . ' <EOS>	55.929639821620576
<SOS> 'very well , ' said he , 'go and attend to your affairs , since you seem to be in a hurry , but come back in half an hour . ' <EOS>	73.11076300862248
<SOS> 'in half an hour ? ' <EOS>	62.93771740339505
<SOS> 'yes , have you breakfasted ? ' <EOS>	58.757507739983865
<SOS> 'faith , no . ' <EOS>	85.28945864369337
<SOS> 'well , here is a pate that will be ready for you , with a bottle of old burgundy . ' <EOS>	53.81600004008189
<SOS> so , you see , my lord , since i am hungry , i would , with your highness 's leave `` and la ramee bent low . <EOS>	75.45491032919841
<SOS> `` go , then , animal , '' said the duke ; `` but remember , i only allow you half an hour . '' <EOS>	63.45750706174107
<SOS> `` may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau , my lord ? '' <EOS>	95.52203687575084
<SOS> `` yes , if he does not put mushrooms in his pies ; thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family . '' <EOS>	93.72187502521203
<SOS> la ramee went out , but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment . <EOS>	99.6329383574674
<SOS> but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon , which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance , but in what way he knew not . <EOS>	95.82839322358095
<SOS> but his confidence in grimaud , whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind , increased , and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance . <EOS>	92.66336518243193
<SOS> chapter xix . <EOS>	50.514300705786866
<SOS> pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described . <EOS>	71.01033289758186
<SOS> in half an hour la ramee returned , full of glee , like most men who have eaten , and more especially drank to their heart 's content . <EOS>	53.250392877929535
<SOS> the pates were excellent , the wine delicious . <EOS>	98.88608589956705
<SOS> the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air . <EOS>	63.458530205954844
<SOS> at two o'clock the tennis balls began , according to grimaud 's directions , to take the direction of the moat , much to the joy of la ramee , who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat ; and very soon balls were wanting , so many had gone over . <EOS>	64.27294996230683
<SOS> la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up , but the duke remarked that it would be losing time ; and going near the rampart himself and looking over , he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat . <EOS>	65.55482344724645
<SOS> `` hey , friend ! '' <EOS>	75.57018244456334
<SOS> cried the duke . <EOS>	103.18877935911007
<SOS> the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise . <EOS>	88.93388001446793
<SOS> the peasant , the gardener , was rochefort , whom he believed to be in the bastile . <EOS>	79.9102964893304
<SOS> `` well ? <EOS>	64.97482898103424
<SOS> who 's up there ? '' <EOS>	63.44152793892991
<SOS> said the man . <EOS>	97.7334283350806
<SOS> `` be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls , '' said the duke . <EOS>	56.494150957797295
<SOS> the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls , which were picked up by la ramee and the guard . <EOS>	70.67484186220466
<SOS> one , however , fell at the duke 's feet , and seeing that it was intended for him , he put it into his pocket . <EOS>	59.37149930160089
<SOS> la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood . <EOS>	82.93184293339205
<SOS> the duke went indoors and retired to bed , where he spent , indeed , the greater part of every day , as they had taken his books away . <EOS>	70.81713097611264
<SOS> la ramee carried off all his clothes , in order to be certain that the duke would not stir . <EOS>	92.42696474666343
<SOS> however , the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter : my lord , your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand . <EOS>	101.9805025722149
<SOS> ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle , and who is no other than noirmont , your former maitre d'hotel . <EOS>	51.600967118375806
<SOS> do not open the pie till you are alone . <EOS>	49.23553518975498
<SOS> i hope you will be satisfied with its contents . <EOS>	46.70764508210955
<SOS> `` your highness 's most devoted servant , `` in the bastile , as elsewhere , `` comte de rochefort . '' <EOS>	90.24382705906281
<SOS> the duke , who had latterly been allowed a fire , burned the letter , but kept the ball , and went to bed , hiding the ball under his bolster . <EOS>	72.59869093589877
<SOS> la ramee entered ; he smiled kindly on the prisoner , for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince . <EOS>	62.88990463752312
<SOS> he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude . <EOS>	73.43968896621506
<SOS> `` ah , my friend ! '' <EOS>	92.1126915096655
<SOS> cried the duke , `` you are so good ; if i could but do as you do , and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau 's successor . '' <EOS>	65.83360439563754
<SOS> `` 't is true , my lord , '' answered la ramee , `` that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent . '' <EOS>	77.98882762745497
<SOS> `` in any case , '' said the duke , `` his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny . '' <EOS>	42.500700066733756
<SOS> `` well , my lord , '' said la ramee , falling into the trap , `` what is there to prevent your trying them ? <EOS>	75.11227834180212
<SOS> besides , i have promised him your patronage . '' <EOS>	73.3337085538993
<SOS> `` you are right , '' said the duke . <EOS>	74.39448846734628
<SOS> `` if i am to remain here permanently , as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand , i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age , i must turn gourmand . '' <EOS>	102.02742181746437
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said la ramee , `` if you will take a bit of good advice , do n't put that off till you are old . '' <EOS>	77.35132271269163
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	103.50836413648835
<SOS> said the duc de beaufort to himself , `` every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul , must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins , perhaps two ; it seems that master la ramee 's is gluttony . <EOS>	86.87328020924367
<SOS> let us then take advantage of it . '' <EOS>	53.85172210140781
<SOS> then , aloud : `` well , my dear la ramee ! <EOS>	81.36520464540897
<SOS> the day after to morrow is a holiday . '' <EOS>	45.3057660745867
<SOS> `` yes , my lord pentecost . '' <EOS>	100.04000408630158
<SOS> `` will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow ? '' <EOS>	59.55695828410358
<SOS> `` in what ? '' <EOS>	65.57221647061394
<SOS> `` in gastronomy ? '' <EOS>	58.46448490969262
<SOS> `` willingly , my lord . '' <EOS>	63.33341907072844
<SOS> `` but tete a tete . <EOS>	79.13766552622764
<SOS> send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny ; we 'll have a supper here under your direction . '' <EOS>	65.0777056763594
<SOS> `` hum ! '' <EOS>	82.67537957844473
<SOS> said la ramee . <EOS>	69.18629151983714
<SOS> the proposal was seductive , but la ramee was an old stager , acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set . <EOS>	86.66358035520858
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison . <EOS>	63.43855840606704
<SOS> did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem ? <EOS>	90.49112437589314
<SOS> he reflected , but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food , no drug with the wine . <EOS>	51.01027471028665
<SOS> as to getting him drunk , the duke could n't hope to do that , and he laughed at the mere thought of it . <EOS>	76.73055233693911
<SOS> then an idea came to him which harmonized everything . <EOS>	85.04472228658344
<SOS> the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee 's unspoken soliloquy , reading it from point to point upon his face . <EOS>	101.19573648692972
<SOS> but presently the exempt 's face suddenly brightened . <EOS>	53.356052277896524
<SOS> `` well , '' he asked , `` that will do , will it not ? '' <EOS>	65.76137654616691
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , on one condition . '' <EOS>	68.3297545307525
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	96.52850555904976
<SOS> `` that grimaud shall wait on us at table . '' <EOS>	82.6146453634323
<SOS> nothing could be more agreeable to the duke , however , he had presence of mind enough to exclaim : `` to the devil with your grimaud ! <EOS>	96.74490310003175
<SOS> he will spoil the feast . '' <EOS>	97.2549658568434
<SOS> `` i will direct him to stand behind your chair , and since he does n't speak , your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away . '' <EOS>	54.84591902523735
<SOS> `` do you know , my friend , i find one thing very evident in all this , you distrust me . '' <EOS>	73.21810224756088
<SOS> `` my lord , the day after to morrow is pentecost . '' <EOS>	91.66932229259501
<SOS> `` well , what is pentecost to me ? <EOS>	45.998616068499885
<SOS> are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison ? '' <EOS>	106.62327050199345
<SOS> `` no , my lord ; but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted . '' <EOS>	42.12248157895749
<SOS> `` and what was it ? '' <EOS>	95.61010640869716
<SOS> `` that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes . '' <EOS>	64.1180807832244
<SOS> `` you believe in sorcerers , then , you fool ? '' <EOS>	76.12963319504044
<SOS> `` i i mind them no more than that `` and he snapped his fingers ; `` but it is my lord giulio who cares about them ; as an italian he is superstitious . '' <EOS>	87.20996914873741
<SOS> the duke shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	58.24662757441486
<SOS> `` well , then , '' with well acted good humor , `` i allow grimaud , but no one else ; you must manage it all . <EOS>	99.23658334286932
<SOS> order whatever you like for supper the only thing i specify is one of those pies ; and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now , but when i leave my prison . '' <EOS>	73.96696940705633
<SOS> `` then you think you will some day leave it ? '' <EOS>	47.540686918524315
<SOS> said la ramee . <EOS>	114.61953640604587
<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	75.02966479707275
<SOS> replied the prince ; `` surely , at the death of mazarin . <EOS>	68.28323619634699
<SOS> i am fifteen years younger than he is . <EOS>	109.60015634933357
<SOS> at vincennes , 't is true , one lives faster `` `` my lord , '' replied la ramee , `` my lord `` `` or dies sooner , for it comes to the same thing . '' <EOS>	88.81437670678936
<SOS> la ramee was going out . <EOS>	68.8010178082386
<SOS> he stopped , however , at the door for an instant . <EOS>	89.35007456504329
<SOS> `` whom does your highness wish me to send to you ? '' <EOS>	55.020175809930294
<SOS> `` any one , except grimaud . '' <EOS>	53.37121310060327
<SOS> `` the officer of the guard , then , with his chessboard ? '' <EOS>	82.62279108815818
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	76.37918901051454
<SOS> five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess . <EOS>	77.55130271500326
<SOS> a strange thing is the mind , and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign , a word , a hope . <EOS>	78.94745457356859
<SOS> the duke had been five years in prison , and now to him , looking back upon them , those five years , which had passed so slowly , seemed not so long a time as were the two days , the forty eight hours , which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape . <EOS>	61.80305795695767
<SOS> besides , there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected ? <EOS>	91.15624703951961
<SOS> they had told him to hope for it , but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate . <EOS>	60.36819336948419
<SOS> and what friends awaited him without ? <EOS>	108.03557014654842
<SOS> he had friends , then , after five years in prison ? <EOS>	98.67096195634022
<SOS> if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince . <EOS>	77.78394310279832
<SOS> he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex , a woman , strange to say , had remembered him . <EOS>	64.25340463381347
<SOS> it is true that she had not , perhaps , been scrupulously faithful to him , but she had remembered him ; that was something . <EOS>	62.1363022211291
<SOS> so the duke had more than enough to think about ; accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis ; he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game . <EOS>	60.30883590543038
<SOS> but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o'clock in the evening ; then would come night , and with night , sleep . <EOS>	75.1720058016476
<SOS> so , at least , the duke believed ; but sleep is a capricious fairy , and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting . <EOS>	86.23176498924201
<SOS> the duke waited until midnight , turning on his mattress like st. laurence on his gridiron . <EOS>	39.29208918055429
<SOS> finally he slept . <EOS>	74.3285165961378
<SOS> but at daybreak he awoke . <EOS>	70.89222020885529
<SOS> wild dreams had disturbed his repose . <EOS>	73.42640088049787
<SOS> he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away . <EOS>	61.7399398343825
<SOS> for a time these wings supported him , but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him . <EOS>	95.04357866358484
<SOS> his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss , whence he awoke , bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen . <EOS>	77.84442600660412
<SOS> he fell asleep again and another vision appeared . <EOS>	65.6782002148799
<SOS> he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes . <EOS>	83.93552688710814
<SOS> grimaud was walking before him with a lantern . <EOS>	63.63546318203058
<SOS> by degrees the passage narrowed , yet the duke continued his course . <EOS>	77.07788253377471
<SOS> at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed . <EOS>	71.80133435928171
<SOS> the sides of the walls seem to close in , even to press against him . <EOS>	92.70706200255931
<SOS> he made fruitless efforts to go on ; it was impossible . <EOS>	80.17969482811529
<SOS> nevertheless , he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front , advancing . <EOS>	66.14924933965374
<SOS> he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word . <EOS>	63.22222046300089
<SOS> then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him . <EOS>	62.70959397847879
<SOS> these steps came on , came fast . <EOS>	101.4001726533559
<SOS> he was discovered ; all hope of flight was gone . <EOS>	82.39399462343083
<SOS> still the walls seemed to be closing on him ; they appeared to be in concert with his enemies . <EOS>	88.4108494034163
<SOS> at last he heard the voice of la ramee . <EOS>	89.04472432283565
<SOS> la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud . <EOS>	80.00552724648247
<SOS> he was captured again , and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber , in which ornano , puylaurens , and his uncle had died . <EOS>	68.37413594144681
<SOS> their three graves were there , rising above the ground , and a fourth was also there , yawning for its ghastly tenant . <EOS>	73.100920125385
<SOS> the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep ; and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill. `` in fact , '' said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache , brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere , `` my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times , while dreaming , he called for help . '' <EOS>	65.00295125050256
<SOS> `` what is the matter with your highness ? '' <EOS>	97.55240646008787
<SOS> asked la ramee . <EOS>	68.70797612913775
<SOS> `` 't is your fault , you simpleton , '' answered the duke . <EOS>	121.07618681741725
<SOS> `` with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping , you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so . '' <EOS>	67.03719962023408
<SOS> la ramee laughed . <EOS>	106.31943931146945
<SOS> `` come , '' he said , `` 't is a warning from heaven . <EOS>	51.92729036504623
<SOS> never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape , except in your dreams . '' <EOS>	59.28594269747601
<SOS> `` and you are right , my dear la ramee , '' said the duke , wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow , wide awake though he was ; `` after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking . '' <EOS>	53.50834767507756
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	74.8808552722967
<SOS> said la ramee ; and one by one he sent away the guards , on various pretexts . <EOS>	102.97894613495579
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	42.89981375618233
<SOS> asked the duke when they were alone . <EOS>	67.13523525461775
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	95.88958956872001
<SOS> replied la ramee , `` your supper is ordered . '' <EOS>	71.8206674191928
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	81.31157436114619
<SOS> and what is it to be ? <EOS>	75.85715042076549
<SOS> monsieur , my majordomo , will there be a pie ? '' <EOS>	77.5686391093985
<SOS> `` i should think so , indeed almost as high as a tower . '' <EOS>	48.24147634341284
<SOS> `` you told him it was for me ? '' <EOS>	82.26849185927885
<SOS> `` yes , and he said he would do his best to please your highness . '' <EOS>	114.38302413738917
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	61.023010022444375
<SOS> exclaimed the duke , rubbing his hands . <EOS>	73.74799008481818
<SOS> `` devil take it , my lord ! <EOS>	61.260897537874506
<SOS> what a gourmand you are growing ; i have n't seen you with so cheerful a face these five years . '' <EOS>	70.50804483313006
<SOS> the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought , but at that moment , as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee 's ideas , grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him . <EOS>	74.95723873066922
<SOS> la ramee drew near to grimaud , who spoke to him in a low voice . <EOS>	63.5577059045537
<SOS> the duke meanwhile recovered his self control . <EOS>	93.92237887544951
<SOS> `` i have already forbidden that man , '' he said , `` to come in here without my permission . '' <EOS>	80.76785377697215
<SOS> `` you must pardon him , my lord , '' said la ramee , `` for i directed him to come . '' <EOS>	88.44679890492012
<SOS> `` and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me ? '' <EOS>	79.34934772190027
<SOS> `` my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper . <EOS>	54.02307516666895
<SOS> my lord has forgotten the supper . '' <EOS>	61.38195907522385
<SOS> `` no , but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud . '' <EOS>	54.381814668909215
<SOS> `` my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present . '' <EOS>	82.21616657241641
<SOS> `` go on , then ; have it your own way . '' <EOS>	110.82635833916316
<SOS> `` come here , my lad , '' said la ramee , `` and hear what i have to say . '' <EOS>	55.763971307674666
<SOS> grimaud approached , with a very sullen expression on his face . <EOS>	70.91730251324036
<SOS> la ramee continued : `` my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete . '' <EOS>	48.12089100732813
<SOS> grimaud made a sign which meant that he did n't see what that had to do with him . <EOS>	77.26277878734794
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said la ramee , `` the matter concerns you , for you will have the honor to serve us ; and besides , however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst , there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles , and that something will be yours . '' <EOS>	71.71052258367868
<SOS> grimaud bowed in thanks . <EOS>	93.04254899189061
<SOS> `` and now , '' said la ramee , `` i must ask your highness 's pardon , but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure . '' <EOS>	85.91913677365382
<SOS> the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud , but there was no glance in grimaud 's eyes . <EOS>	82.07671085001824
<SOS> `` go , then , '' said the duke , `` and return as soon as possible . '' <EOS>	80.99264155437234
<SOS> `` does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday ? '' <EOS>	89.3274243984612
<SOS> grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent . <EOS>	75.49027265753041
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the duke , `` but take care , my dear la ramee , for i propose to beat you badly . '' <EOS>	83.3416557111745
<SOS> la ramee went out . <EOS>	72.70081690730228
<SOS> grimaud looked after him , and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper . <EOS>	58.78787168712849
<SOS> `` write , my lord , '' he said . <EOS>	57.70325761626701
<SOS> `` and what ? '' <EOS>	64.09688118678523
<SOS> grimaud dictated . <EOS>	70.92068659726552
<SOS> `` all is ready for to morrow evening . <EOS>	83.11475531022582
<SOS> keep watch from seven to nine . <EOS>	51.547205817438766
<SOS> have two riding horses ready . <EOS>	55.461175438785794
<SOS> we shall descend by the first window in the gallery . '' <EOS>	87.11320698002615
<SOS> `` what next ? '' <EOS>	75.4135627286713
<SOS> `` sign your name , my lord . '' <EOS>	79.18526156784412
<SOS> the duke signed . <EOS>	54.04837773630244
<SOS> `` now , my lord , give me , if you have not lost it , the ball that which contained the letter . '' <EOS>	65.87652073503794
<SOS> the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud . <EOS>	94.58864653156111
<SOS> grimaud gave a grim smile . <EOS>	47.01226382626096
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	53.43825887762715
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	70.64765000391996
<SOS> `` well , my lord , i sew up the paper in the ball and you , in your game of tennis , will send the ball into the ditch . '' <EOS>	57.78162374876238
<SOS> `` but will it not be lost ? '' <EOS>	85.71867547565559
<SOS> `` oh no ; there will be some one at hand to pick it up . '' <EOS>	92.0077637379773
<SOS> `` a gardener ? '' <EOS>	88.0760210522661
<SOS> grimaud nodded . <EOS>	95.67186199389101
<SOS> `` the same as yesterday ? '' <EOS>	49.402523483437925
<SOS> another nod on the part of grimaud . <EOS>	65.07517455374295
<SOS> `` the count de rochefort ? '' <EOS>	51.749987111965744
<SOS> grimaud nodded the third time . <EOS>	77.65144295738618
<SOS> `` come , now , '' said the duke , `` give some particulars of the plan for our escape . '' <EOS>	67.67053828519069
<SOS> `` that is forbidden me , '' said grimaud , `` until the last moment . '' <EOS>	59.91182470247424
<SOS> `` who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch ? '' <EOS>	54.912868722208486
<SOS> `` i know nothing about it , my lord . '' <EOS>	45.39482564205821
<SOS> `` but at least , if you do n't want to see me turn crazy , tell what that famous pate will contain . '' <EOS>	94.99476876968679
<SOS> `` two poniards , a knotted rope and a poire d'angoisse . '' <EOS>	50.95131488510874
<SOS> * * this poire d'angoisse was a famous gag , in the form of a pear , which , being thrust into the mouth , by the aid of a spring , dilated , so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width . <EOS>	54.270124100655245
<SOS> `` yes , i understand . '' <EOS>	100.6015651344059
<SOS> `` my lord observes that there will be enough to go around . '' <EOS>	75.52930307784992
<SOS> `` we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope , '' replied the duke . <EOS>	65.42565224587734
<SOS> `` and make la ramee eat the pear , '' answered grimaud . <EOS>	71.15755530096966
<SOS> `` my dear grimaud , thou speakest seldom , but when thou dost , one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold . '' <EOS>	56.39588361642231
<SOS> chapter xx . <EOS>	88.62002301961955
<SOS> one of marie michon 's adventures . <EOS>	84.61034196401273
<SOS> whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud , the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel . <EOS>	66.66919346528762
<SOS> they stopped at the sign of the fox , in the rue du vieux colombier , a tavern known for many years by athos , and asked for two bedrooms . <EOS>	85.92468346590586
<SOS> `` you must dress yourself , raoul , '' said athos , `` i am going to present you to some one . '' <EOS>	68.12800611313273
<SOS> `` to day , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	94.7023351848919
<SOS> asked the young man . <EOS>	54.74597812787579
<SOS> `` in half an hour . '' <EOS>	40.691094009229495
<SOS> the young man bowed . <EOS>	85.37529815372388
<SOS> perhaps , not being endowed with the endurance of athos , who seemed to be made of iron , he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much , and afterward his bed ; but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey . <EOS>	107.82726759528985
<SOS> `` by the way , '' said athos , `` take some pains with your toilet , raoul ; i want you to be approved . '' <EOS>	44.5952203913669
<SOS> `` i hope , sir , '' replied the youth , smiling , `` that there 's no idea of a marriage for me ; you know of my engagement to louise ? '' <EOS>	75.31718843873055
<SOS> athos , in his turn , smiled also . <EOS>	63.12699994065431
<SOS> `` no , do n't be alarmed , although it is to a lady that i am going to present you , and i am anxious that you should love her `` the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness , but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured . <EOS>	85.81531958381245
<SOS> `` how old is she ? '' <EOS>	88.9124425779008
<SOS> inquired the vicomte de bragelonne . <EOS>	72.15628137571112
<SOS> `` my dear raoul , learn , once for all , that that is a question which is never asked . <EOS>	75.02371307074509
<SOS> when you can find out a woman 's age by her face , it is useless to ask it ; when you can not do so , it is indiscreet . '' <EOS>	47.58308234050692
<SOS> `` is she beautiful ? '' <EOS>	85.57039224647366
<SOS> `` sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest , but the most graceful woman in france . '' <EOS>	105.65845700290917
<SOS> this reply reassured the vicomte . <EOS>	59.75984280304399
<SOS> a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him . <EOS>	96.51451080088587
<SOS> he retired to his toilet . <EOS>	71.21831189027681
<SOS> when he reappeared , athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d'artagnan , but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face . <EOS>	61.13536378997187
<SOS> athos cast a glance at his feet , hands and hair those three marks of race . <EOS>	60.66593132269443
<SOS> the youth 's dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls , forming a sort of dark frame around his face ; such was the fashion of the day . <EOS>	59.51911909713684
<SOS> gloves of gray kid , matching the hat , well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand ; whilst his boots , similar in color to the hat and gloves , confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old . <EOS>	88.72112619091229
<SOS> `` come , '' murmured athos , `` if she is not proud of him , she must be hard to please . '' <EOS>	69.543650029312
<SOS> it was three o'clock in the afternoon . <EOS>	93.8051343431286
<SOS> the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel , surmounted with the arms of de luynes . <EOS>	97.32793770955676
<SOS> `` 't is here , '' said athos . <EOS>	85.5134058494826
<SOS> he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps , and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery , asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere ? <EOS>	87.36011932666075
<SOS> the servant returned with a message to say , that , though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere , she would receive him . <EOS>	75.31195970192032
<SOS> athos followed the footman , who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door . <EOS>	50.867942902740964
<SOS> athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was . <EOS>	89.5390738401405
<SOS> the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere . <EOS>	67.41089329993619
<SOS> madame de chevreuse , whose name appears so often in our story `` the three musketeers , '' without her actually having appeared in any scene , was still a beautiful woman . <EOS>	71.77391469833562
<SOS> although about forty four or forty five years old , she might have passed for thirty five . <EOS>	74.57167938279392
<SOS> she still had her rich fair hair ; her large , animated , intelligent eyes , so often opened by intrigue , so often closed by the blindness of love . <EOS>	85.57566327015701
<SOS> she had still her nymph like form , so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped , with anne of austria , over the moat of the tuileries in < num > . <EOS>	66.77521551574492
<SOS> in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family . <EOS>	60.36305516932847
<SOS> she was in a little boudoir , hung with blue damask , adorned by red flowers , with a foliage of gold , looking upon a garden ; and reclined upon a sofa , her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it . <EOS>	85.05785620587179
<SOS> she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion . <EOS>	74.57763156312906
<SOS> at the footman 's announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out , with some curiosity . <EOS>	69.56553915047965
<SOS> athos appeared . <EOS>	110.50278089952417
<SOS> he was dressed in violet tinted velvet , trimmed with silk of the same color . <EOS>	81.18272022224743
<SOS> his shoulder knots were of burnished silver , his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it ; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat ; his boots were of black leather , and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron . <EOS>	68.69304407248953
<SOS> splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt , and lace fell also over the top of his boots . <EOS>	95.95557855896189
<SOS> in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree , that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her . <EOS>	72.80645054697908
<SOS> athos bowed and obeyed . <EOS>	64.97950808263818
<SOS> the footman was withdrawing , but athos stopped him by a sign . <EOS>	67.11297632215478
<SOS> `` madame , '' he said to the duchess , `` i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you ; it has succeeded , since you deign to receive me . <EOS>	58.21533820188703
<SOS> i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour . '' <EOS>	66.92867884684655
<SOS> `` i grant it , monsieur , '' replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile . <EOS>	91.38143547325663
<SOS> `` but that is not all , madame . <EOS>	70.36062086073868
<SOS> oh , i am very presuming , i am aware . <EOS>	89.74620525847689
<SOS> the interview for which i ask is of us two alone , and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted . '' <EOS>	53.70571771753958
<SOS> `` i am not at home to any one , '' said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman . <EOS>	96.69248320932182
<SOS> `` you may go . '' <EOS>	42.813735425334364
<SOS> the footman went out . <EOS>	81.1989060083413
<SOS> there ensued a brief silence , during which these two persons , who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race , examined each other without embarrassment on either side . <EOS>	84.1358640339901
<SOS> the duchess was the first to speak . <EOS>	72.84585614111744
<SOS> `` well , sir , i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me . '' <EOS>	57.416270633719826

<SOS> `` you encourage me , '' said athos , `` i will continue , then . <EOS>	70.20964598147253
<SOS> that cousin of aramis , that marie michon , that needlewoman , notwithstanding her low condition , had acquaintances in the highest rank ; she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend , and the queen proud as she is , in her double character as austrian and as spaniard called her her sister . '' <EOS>	73.31781738676031
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	59.99179303194285
<SOS> said madame de chevreuse , with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own , `` since that time everything has changed . '' <EOS>	90.87097854688405
<SOS> `` and the queen had reason for her affection , for marie was devoted to her devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother , the king of spain . '' <EOS>	79.36485328038079

<SOS> `` and therefore , '' continued athos , `` the cardinal the true cardinal , the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches . <EOS>	82.43108879335843
<SOS> fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen . <EOS>	70.49845540539708
<SOS> the case had been provided for : if marie michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayer book bound in green velvet . '' <EOS>	74.6182501797832

<SOS> the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey ; he sent them two excellent horses , and the fugitives went out hastily from tours , shaping their course toward spain , trembling at the least noise , following unfrequented roads , and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn .

<SOS> madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise , and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile . <EOS>	67.5153996529554

<SOS> marie michon was a very aristocratic person ; like her sister the queen , she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen ; she resolved , therefore , to seek hospitality of the priest . '' <EOS>	64.51281480199522

<SOS> but let us see ; whatever i may be , '' she added , hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow , `` let us see what profession you wish to follow . '' <EOS>	67.34690217658621
<SOS> athos , standing , looked at them both with indescribable pleasure . <EOS>	81.87706096621376
<SOS> `` madame , '' answered the youth in his sweet voice , `` it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman that of the army . <EOS>	69.03189767071191
<SOS> i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention , i believe , of making me a soldier ; and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince . '' <EOS>	95.16361157147023
<SOS> `` yes , i understand it well . <EOS>	77.29683152544101
<SOS> personally , i am on bad terms with him , on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon , my mother in law , and madame de longueville . <EOS>	77.5361501296196
<SOS> but the prince de marsillac ! <EOS>	72.70207806651274
<SOS> yes , indeed , that 's the right thing . <EOS>	105.47108269274794
<SOS> the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville , who will give him a letter to her brother , the prince , who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately . '' <EOS>	65.35957853082607
<SOS> `` well , that will do charmingly , '' said the count ; `` but may i beg that the greatest haste may be made , for i have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in paris ! '' <EOS>	74.61380330081433
<SOS> `` do you wish it known that you are interested about him , monsieur le comte ? '' <EOS>	59.02495718534806
<SOS> `` better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me . '' <EOS>	68.9958439465932
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	119.99775190988544
<SOS> cried raoul . <EOS>	68.0573176241724
<SOS> `` you know , bragelonne , '' said athos , `` i never speak without reflection . '' <EOS>	91.17968345649972
<SOS> `` well , comte , i am going instantly , '' interrupted the duchess , `` to send for the prince de marsillac , who is happily , in paris just now . <EOS>	51.32753073774656
<SOS> what are you going to do this evening ? '' <EOS>	70.94768941630821
<SOS> `` we intend to visit the abbé scarron , for whom i have a letter of introduction and at whose house i expect to meet some of my friends . '' <EOS>	85.16676482366637
<SOS> `` 't is well ; i will go there also , for a few minutes , '' said the duchess ; `` do not quit his salon until you have seen me . '' <EOS>	67.42320263904882
<SOS> athos bowed and prepared to leave . <EOS>	50.752492918310324
<SOS> `` well , monsieur le comte , '' said the duchess , smiling , `` does one leave so solemnly his old friends ? '' <EOS>	67.20294094284671
<SOS> `` ah , '' murmured athos , kissing her hand , `` had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature ! '' <EOS>	82.5685908761633
<SOS> and he withdrew , sighing . <EOS>	42.39078018714981
<SOS> chapter xxi . <EOS>	63.68767708681547
<SOS> the abbé scarron . <EOS>	78.26136614075263
<SOS> there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris , and yet , nevertheless , this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man . <EOS>	42.886773408136705
<SOS> there was neither dining , nor playing at cards , nor dancing in that house . <EOS>	84.64015866281699
<SOS> nevertheless , it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there . <EOS>	57.337642719913525
<SOS> it was the abode of the little abbé scarron . <EOS>	83.86015481199185
<SOS> in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter ; there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed , misrepresented , metamorphosed , some into epigrams , some into falsehoods , that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron , listening to what he said , reporting it to others . <EOS>	61.090998926926886
<SOS> the diminutive abbé scarron , who , however , was an abbé only because he owned an abbey , and not because he was in orders , had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of mans , which he inhabited . <EOS>	56.26993022973352
<SOS> on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town , of which he was the life and soul . <EOS>	72.15373241894235
<SOS> he had made his valet cover him with honey ; then , opening a feather bed , he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine . <EOS>	113.21912261403695
<SOS> he then began to visit his friends of both sexes , in that strange costume . <EOS>	115.12956395269529
<SOS> at first he had been followed through astonishment , then with derisive shouts , then the porters had insulted him , then children had thrown stones at him , and finally he was obliged to run , to escape the missiles . <EOS>	72.12258827270213
<SOS> as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him , until , pressed on all sides , scarron found no way of escaping his escort , except by throwing himself into the river ; but the water was icy cold . <EOS>	91.12961838209927
<SOS> scarron was heated , the cold seized on him , and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled . <EOS>	61.32333209447801
<SOS> every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs . <EOS>	80.57719853861289
<SOS> he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine , at length he sent away all his doctors , declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment , and came to paris , where the fame of his wit had preceded him . <EOS>	105.42777896555589
<SOS> there he had a chair made on his own plan , and one day , visiting anne of austria in this chair , she asked him , charmed as she was with his wit , if he did not wish for a title . <EOS>	47.36143878966137
<SOS> `` yes , your majesty , there is a title which i covet much , '' replied scarron . <EOS>	94.31040771480232
<SOS> `` and what is that ? '' <EOS>	87.9265164180861
<SOS> `` that of being your invalid , '' answered scarron . <EOS>	81.44686989711361
<SOS> so he was called the queen 's invalid , with a pension of fifteen hundred francs . <EOS>	93.2061197175
<SOS> from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life , spending both income and principal . <EOS>	66.19413106720178
<SOS> one day , however , an emissary of the cardinal 's gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often . <EOS>	90.84638561104668
<SOS> `` and why ? '' <EOS>	55.254205053538094
<SOS> asked scarron ; `` is he not a man of good birth ? '' <EOS>	58.32976529686818
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	59.78243093259259
<SOS> `` agreeable ? '' <EOS>	72.62096590716135
<SOS> `` undeniably . '' <EOS>	78.16301752838359
<SOS> `` witty ? '' <EOS>	73.76814834638905
<SOS> `` he has , unfortunately , too much wit . '' <EOS>	69.6491576563928
<SOS> `` well , then , why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man ? '' <EOS>	72.78294512178687
<SOS> `` because he is an enemy . '' <EOS>	82.7744920380999
<SOS> `` of whom ? '' <EOS>	51.72696867486682
<SOS> `` of the cardinal . '' <EOS>	61.20034692134857
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	83.5596087328531
<SOS> answered scarron , `` i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux , who thinks ill of me , and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor , because he thinks ill of another man . <EOS>	83.22598285014668
<SOS> impossible ! '' <EOS>	85.13184343981122
<SOS> the conversation had rested there and scarron , through sheer obstinacy , had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently . <EOS>	58.26755282413044
<SOS> now , the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment , and scarron , as usual , had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office , but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron . <EOS>	44.570098740264335
<SOS> it was on thursday , the abbé 's reception day ; people went there in crowds . <EOS>	63.30281883526516
<SOS> the cardinal 's refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence . <EOS>	101.39582080338226
<SOS> in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know , on horseback like himself , followed by a lackey like himself , and going in the same direction that he was . <EOS>	85.29156265166861
<SOS> one of them , hat in hand , said to him : `` would you believe it , monsieur ? <EOS>	112.81063249534046
<SOS> that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron 's pension . '' <EOS>	71.44887173383408
<SOS> `` that is unreasonable , '' said athos , saluting in his turn the two cavaliers . <EOS>	63.292125266357985
<SOS> and they separated with courteous gestures . <EOS>	94.92470972598771
<SOS> `` it happens well that we are going there this evening , '' said athos to the vicomte ; `` we will pay our compliments to that poor man . '' <EOS>	114.7676843865179
<SOS> `` what , then , is this monsieur scarron , who thus puts all paris in commotion ? <EOS>	77.91651021663256
<SOS> is he some minister out of office ? '' <EOS>	61.96498900333768
<SOS> `` oh , no , not at all , vicomte , '' athos replied ; `` he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him . '' <EOS>	71.89164971922557
<SOS> `` do gentlemen , then , make verses ? '' <EOS>	41.38945272179229
<SOS> asked raoul , naively , `` i thought it was derogatory . '' <EOS>	56.101182687710455
<SOS> `` so it is , my dear vicomte , '' said athos , laughing , `` to make bad ones ; but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou . <EOS>	73.35515726647331
<SOS> nevertheless , '' he continued , in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice , `` i think it is better not to make them . '' <EOS>	63.25420274526965
<SOS> `` then , '' said raoul , `` this monsieur scarron is a poet ? '' <EOS>	87.02167807087129
<SOS> `` yes ; you are warned , vicomte . <EOS>	76.58373655601841
<SOS> consider well what you do in that house . <EOS>	84.82842763922862
<SOS> talk only by gestures , or rather always listen . '' <EOS>	66.23648497597958
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , '' replied raoul . <EOS>	68.97107384009414
<SOS> `` you will see me talking with one of my friends , the abbé d'herblay , of whom you have often heard me speak . '' <EOS>	66.36761683222716
<SOS> `` i remember him , monsieur . '' <EOS>	64.35195259121987
<SOS> `` come near to us from time to time , as if to speak ; but do not speak , and do not listen . <EOS>	66.50077472783708
<SOS> that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers . '' <EOS>	106.53017059817327
<SOS> `` very well , monsieur ; i will obey you at all points . '' <EOS>	46.59584612678068
<SOS> athos made two visits in paris ; at seven o'clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles ; it was stopped by porters , horses and footmen . <EOS>	47.737454620839195
<SOS> athos forced his way through and entered , followed by the young man . <EOS>	49.54586631306774
<SOS> the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis , planted near a great chair on castors , very large , covered with a canopy of tapestry , under which there moved , enveloped in a quilt of brocade , a little face , youngish , very merry , somewhat pallid , whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively , intellectual , and amiable . <EOS>	60.058979846779806
<SOS> this was the abbé scarron , always laughing , joking , complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch . <EOS>	88.11086178089165
<SOS> around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies . <EOS>	72.95357696237134
<SOS> the room was neatly , comfortably furnished . <EOS>	61.278614727534176
<SOS> large valances of silk , embroidered with flowers of gay colors , which were rather faded , fell from the wide windows ; the fittings of the room were simple , but in excellent taste . <EOS>	101.62183837406359
<SOS> two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company . <EOS>	57.24819288954615
<SOS> on perceiving athos , aramis advanced toward him , took him by the hand and presented him to scarron . <EOS>	56.100089894184784
<SOS> raoul remained silent , for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit . <EOS>	112.95719321027774
<SOS> after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet . <EOS>	82.80371111036222
<SOS> athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte . <EOS>	59.560942129101925
<SOS> `` look at this lady , raoul , she is an historic personage ; it was to visit her king henry iv . <EOS>	64.69810112558575
<SOS> was going when he was assassinated . '' <EOS>	80.69400657735119
<SOS> every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet , for she was always very much the fashion . <EOS>	69.93406151501841
<SOS> she was a tall woman , with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls , such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with . <EOS>	82.0382147038899
<SOS> this fawn colored hair , or , perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women , gave her the name of `` la lionne . '' <EOS>	98.25636412139164
<SOS> mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat , but before sitting down , she cast , in all her queen like grandeur , a look around the room , and her eyes rested on raoul . <EOS>	89.52746581321597
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	115.91624673037924
<SOS> `` mademoiselle paulet has observed you , vicomte ; go and bow to her ; do n't try to appear anything but what you are , a true country youth ; on no account speak to her of henry iv . '' <EOS>	64.08649499292027
<SOS> `` when shall we two walk together ? '' <EOS>	38.97990435029595
<SOS> athos then said to aramis . <EOS>	74.15351046935885
<SOS> `` presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet ; we shall be remarked . '' <EOS>	66.02657147597964
<SOS> at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor . <EOS>	83.27792229129099
<SOS> at this name every one looked around , for his was already a very celebrated name . <EOS>	49.23901083537282
<SOS> athos did the same . <EOS>	68.62318148208206
<SOS> he knew the abbé de gondy only by report . <EOS>	85.16247759920348
<SOS> he saw a little dark man , ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing a sword and firing a pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his face . <EOS>	122.75784103538561
<SOS> scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair . <EOS>	83.96530334526858
<SOS> `` well , '' said the coadjutor , on seeing him , `` you are in disgrace , then , abbé ? '' <EOS>	44.31456084606902
<SOS> this was the orthodox phrase . <EOS>	56.54994523198187
<SOS> it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject ; he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether , but one despairing effort saved him . <EOS>	122.89282560387382
<SOS> `` monsieur , the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me , '' he said . <EOS>	94.13205571910035
<SOS> `` but how can you continue to receive us ? '' <EOS>	56.406102596479165
<SOS> asked the coadjutor ; `` if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame . '' <EOS>	103.42832626638342
<SOS> `` oh , no ! '' <EOS>	44.25307478159357
<SOS> cried scarron , `` i should compromise you too much . '' <EOS>	92.36306244556418
<SOS> `` perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant ? '' <EOS>	112.26697634478
<SOS> `` i shall borrow from the queen . '' <EOS>	108.80325666852002
<SOS> `` but her majesty has no property , '' interposed aramis . <EOS>	93.31369108633871
<SOS> at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced . <EOS>	60.1954566751373
<SOS> every one arose . <EOS>	71.91040449617645
<SOS> scarron turned his chair toward the door , raoul blushed , athos made a sign to aramis , who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window . <EOS>	50.38973729570894
<SOS> in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance , the duchess seemed to be looking for some one ; at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled ; she perceived athos and became thoughtful ; she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan . <EOS>	78.29837664021817
<SOS> `` apropos , '' she said , as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself , `` how is poor voiture , do you know , scarron ? '' <EOS>	88.33217916856339
<SOS> `` what , is monsieur voiture ill ? '' <EOS>	63.94227422607683
<SOS> inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore ; `` what is the matter with him ? '' <EOS>	53.81906622271184
<SOS> `` he was acting , but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance , '' said the coadjutor , `` so he took cold and is about to die . '' <EOS>	61.10389194140057
<SOS> `` is he then so ill , dear voiture ? '' <EOS>	76.31414011291538
<SOS> asked aramis , half hidden by the window curtain . <EOS>	57.420468270310394
<SOS> `` die ! '' <EOS>	62.7640058114467
<SOS> cried mademoiselle paulet , bitterly , `` he ! <EOS>	48.35324652423951
<SOS> why , he is surrounded by sultanas , like a turk . <EOS>	70.39585997253748
<SOS> madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth ; la renaudot warms his sheets ; the marquise de rambouillet sends him his tisanes . '' <EOS>	51.239920378958665
<SOS> `` you do n't like him , my dear parthenie , '' said scarron . <EOS>	70.81482758131229
<SOS> `` what an injustice , my dear invalid ! <EOS>	75.63106606054113
<SOS> i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul . '' <EOS>	72.63768850025923
<SOS> `` you are not called 'lionne ' for nothing , '' observed madame de chevreuse , `` your teeth are terrible . '' <EOS>	95.41191785955645
<SOS> `` you are unjust to a great poet , it seems to me , '' raoul ventured to say . <EOS>	63.20813350422139
<SOS> `` a great poet ! <EOS>	60.05236785886373
<SOS> come , one may easily see , vicomte , that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him . <EOS>	92.66119595544751
<SOS> a great poet ! <EOS>	74.70181075299047
<SOS> he is scarcely five feet high . '' <EOS>	48.47040803932119
<SOS> `` bravo bravo ! '' <EOS>	73.50067281273598
<SOS> cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier , `` bravo , fair paulet , it is high time to put little voiture in his right place . <EOS>	84.12807819471297
<SOS> for my part , i always thought his poetry detestable , and i think i know something about poetry . '' <EOS>	75.04267794994237
<SOS> `` who is this officer , '' inquired raoul of athos , `` who is speaking ? '' <EOS>	83.81445502526697
<SOS> `` monsieur de scudery , the author of 'clelie , ' and of 'le grand cyrus , ' which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister , who is now talking to that pretty person yonder , near monsieur scarron . '' <EOS>	61.921057826167505
<SOS> raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived . <EOS>	114.02910985176422
<SOS> one was perfectly charming , delicate , pensive , shaded by beautiful dark hair , and eyes soft as velvet , like those lovely flowers , the heartsease , in which shine out the golden petals . <EOS>	65.14650420581015
<SOS> the other , of mature age , seemed to have the former one under her charge , and was cold , dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee . <EOS>	86.42179341153529
<SOS> raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes , who by a strange fancy , although she bore no resemblance , reminded him of his poor little louise , whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom , in the midst of all the party , he had never for one moment quite forgotten . <EOS>	52.64729050763131
<SOS> meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor , who , smiling all the while , contrived to drop some words into his ear . <EOS>	63.506539720437786
<SOS> aramis , notwithstanding his self control , could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise . <EOS>	62.50571875640616
<SOS> `` laugh , then , '' said monsieur de retz ; `` they are looking at us . '' <EOS>	77.30166849709998
<SOS> and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse , who was in the midst of a large group . <EOS>	64.60483406619832
<SOS> aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room . <EOS>	72.0281475025911
<SOS> as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation . <EOS>	62.08908535494087
<SOS> raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do . <EOS>	53.657486970651526
<SOS> `` 't is a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l'abbé is repeating to me . '' <EOS>	73.57618785501569
<SOS> said athos in a loud voice , `` and i confess i think it incomparable . '' <EOS>	108.94890431394214
<SOS> raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse . <EOS>	84.04999410165942
<SOS> `` well , then ? '' <EOS>	50.98788515439724
<SOS> asked athos , in a low tone . <EOS>	71.98190899999157
<SOS> `` it is to be to morrow , '' said aramis hastily . <EOS>	85.17273249913178
<SOS> `` at what time ? '' <EOS>	80.63661887041243
<SOS> `` six o'clock . '' <EOS>	78.2934023198617
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	52.3138151737434
<SOS> `` at saint mande . '' <EOS>	85.66829083787694
<SOS> `` who told you ? '' <EOS>	58.35955004335955
<SOS> `` the count de rochefort . '' <EOS>	54.01893543995611
<SOS> some one drew near . <EOS>	79.21609028824804
<SOS> `` and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture 's works , but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet , a true poet . '' <EOS>	70.85078210311337
<SOS> aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody . <EOS>	83.04766995943812
<SOS> `` and i , too , '' murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes . <EOS>	86.16304329516893
<SOS> `` i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly . '' <EOS>	101.36976951301725
<SOS> `` monsieur scarron , do me the honor , '' said raoul , blushing , `` to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company . '' <EOS>	107.81018921175409
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	47.96967133326957
<SOS> my young vicomte , '' replied scarron , `` i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive . '' <EOS>	47.5377933136607
<SOS> raoul blushed again . <EOS>	81.31822845821765
<SOS> `` you asked the name of that young lady . <EOS>	78.35492557268716
<SOS> she is called the fair indian . '' <EOS>	75.42173672102936
<SOS> `` excuse me , sir , '' returned raoul , blushing still more deeply , `` i know no more than i did before . <EOS>	44.6632821133748
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	68.88897148909108
<SOS> i am from the country . '' <EOS>	82.66454734986745
<SOS> `` which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets . <EOS>	81.17810054841657
<SOS> so much the better , young man ! <EOS>	86.4947773945947
<SOS> so much the better ! <EOS>	101.49049325100903
<SOS> do n't try to understand it you will only lose your time . '' <EOS>	83.01939931524332
<SOS> `` you forgive me , then , sir , '' said raoul , `` and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian ? '' <EOS>	55.249180560637846
<SOS> `` certainly ; one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d'aubigne . '' <EOS>	85.7422494078319
<SOS> `` does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa , the friend of henry iv. ? '' <EOS>	75.77929213451131
<SOS> `` his granddaughter . <EOS>	77.93361787828199
<SOS> she comes from martinique , so i call her the beautiful indian . '' <EOS>	81.16662278271896
<SOS> raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady , who smiled . <EOS>	68.50849304050045
<SOS> the company went on speaking of the poet voiture . <EOS>	71.57737042374868
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said mademoiselle d'aubigne to scarron , as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul , `` do you not admire monsieur voiture 's friends ? <EOS>	72.85030923709337
<SOS> listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him ; one takes away from him all claim to good sense , another robs him of his poetry , a third of his originality , another of his humor , another of his independence of character , a sixth but , good heavens ! <EOS>	49.29597022334754
<SOS> what will they leave him ? <EOS>	59.23410086048709
<SOS> as mademoiselle de scudery remarks . '' <EOS>	54.163263270382366
<SOS> scarron and raoul laughed . <EOS>	81.12079729247002
<SOS> the fair indian , astonished at the sensation her observation produced , looked down and resumed her air of naivete . <EOS>	66.53105617203529
<SOS> athos , still within the inclosure of the window , watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips . <EOS>	59.359038258821755
<SOS> `` tell the comte de la fere to come to me , '' said madame de chevreuse , `` i want to speak to him . '' <EOS>	73.91371384781077
<SOS> `` and i , '' said the coadjutor , `` want it to be thought that i do not speak to him . <EOS>	65.20456771868382
<SOS> i admire , i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow . '' <EOS>	93.25211000261797
<SOS> `` and why day after to morrow ? '' <EOS>	46.87572762506013
<SOS> asked madame de chevreuse . <EOS>	74.51330043442552
<SOS> `` you will know that to morrow evening , '' said the coadjutor , smiling . <EOS>	86.49355034788387
<SOS> `` really , my dear gondy , '' said the duchess , `` you remind one of the apocalypse . <EOS>	97.92140425905554
<SOS> monsieur d'herblay , '' she added , turning toward aramis , `` will you be my servant once more this evening ? '' <EOS>	68.7630303990537
<SOS> `` how can you doubt it ? '' <EOS>	75.2453396139044
<SOS> replied aramis ; `` this evening , to morrow , always ; command me . '' <EOS>	102.13764153026518
<SOS> `` i will , then . <EOS>	81.45746283408869
<SOS> go and look for the comte de la fere ; i wish to speak with him . '' <EOS>	94.9235864227885
<SOS> aramis found athos and brought him . <EOS>	90.24861846060124
<SOS> `` monsieur le comte , '' said the duchess , giving him a letter , `` here is what i promised you ; our young friend will be extremely well received . '' <EOS>	66.46574264205205
<SOS> `` madame , he is very happy in owing any obligation to you . '' <EOS>	80.24116776878404
<SOS> `` you have no reason to envy him on that score , for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him , '' replied the witty woman , with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos . <EOS>	68.38270035792114
<SOS> as she uttered that bon mot , she arose and asked for her carriage . <EOS>	69.20702215322163
<SOS> mademoiselle paulet had already gone ; mademoiselle de scudery was going . <EOS>	71.3772309758746
<SOS> `` vicomte , '' said athos to raoul , `` follow the duchess ; beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs , and thank her as you descend . '' <EOS>	109.02216009118045
<SOS> the fair indian approached scarron . <EOS>	53.21175723161855
<SOS> `` you are going already ? '' <EOS>	53.1989875670379
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	96.25006375757341
<SOS> `` one of the last , as you see ; if you hear anything of monsieur voiture , be so kind as to send me word to morrow . '' <EOS>	73.64176475547322
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	65.58854995233591
<SOS> said scarron , `` he may die now . '' <EOS>	49.236020098679425
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	89.2302938189457
<SOS> asked the young girl with the velvet eyes . <EOS>	80.50764698180795
<SOS> `` certainly ; his panegyric has been uttered . '' <EOS>	73.2504971742109
<SOS> they parted , laughing , she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest , he looking after her with eyes of love . <EOS>	84.67022152569275
<SOS> one by one the several groups broke up . <EOS>	73.1712468533854
<SOS> scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously , that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation . <EOS>	90.47675110116472
<SOS> what was all that to scarron ? <EOS>	52.68146385068331
<SOS> at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity , for , as we have said , since that morning he had ceased to be `` the queen 's invalid . '' <EOS>	81.3888221295072
<SOS> as to raoul , he had attended the duchess to her carriage , where , as she took her seat , she gave him her hand to kiss ; then , by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous , she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead , saying : `` vicomte , may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune ! '' <EOS>	62.171679918320116
<SOS> then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes . <EOS>	56.674176911464514
<SOS> the carriage had started , madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man , and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction . <EOS>	53.92921066371817
<SOS> athos surmised what had taken place and smiled . <EOS>	84.45145323503509
<SOS> `` come , vicomte , '' he said , `` it is time for you to go to bed ; you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince . <EOS>	77.5038970679967
<SOS> sleep well your last night as citizen . '' <EOS>	82.66335158430573
<SOS> `` i am to be a soldier then ? '' <EOS>	79.58922859713063
<SOS> said the young man . <EOS>	63.601200480656985
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur , i thank you with all my heart . '' <EOS>	83.43987870397218
<SOS> `` adieu , count , '' said the abbé d'herblay ; `` i return to my convent . '' <EOS>	61.54380877243711
<SOS> `` adieu , abbé , '' said the coadjutor , `` i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening . '' <EOS>	80.41673802117764
<SOS> `` adieu , gentlemen , '' said the count ; `` i am going to sleep twenty four hours ; i am just falling down with fatigue . '' <EOS>	95.11567065891143
<SOS> the three men saluted one another , whilst exchanging a last look . <EOS>	76.52251140162271
<SOS> scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye . <EOS>	95.09147013366639
<SOS> `` not one of them will do as he says , '' he murmured , with his little monkey smile ; `` but they may do as they please , the brave gentlemen ! <EOS>	52.09923969990272
<SOS> who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension ? <EOS>	81.66384539366113
<SOS> they can move their arms , they can , and that is much . <EOS>	61.401793058438564
<SOS> alas , i have only my tongue , but i will try to show that it is good for something . <EOS>	46.28585479806743
<SOS> ho , there , champenois ! <EOS>	92.26377728516891
<SOS> here , it is eleven o'clock . <EOS>	53.296769563453225
<SOS> come and roll me to bed . <EOS>	42.00937549437243
<SOS> really , that demoiselle d'aubigne is very charming ! '' <EOS>	51.51126955912138
<SOS> so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room ; and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished . <EOS>	53.31826965662027
<SOS> chapter xxii . <EOS>	67.60060279431346
<SOS> saint denis . <EOS>	84.59304474797342
<SOS> the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself . <EOS>	64.54445686051581
<SOS> it was plain , by a paleness still greater than usual , and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face , that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping . <EOS>	76.618978404566
<SOS> contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided , there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute . <EOS>	97.07022052590062
<SOS> he was occupied with the preparations for raoul 's departure and was seeking to gain time . <EOS>	53.386366152115166
<SOS> in the first place he himself furbished a sword , which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath ; he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt . <EOS>	75.83102415101717
<SOS> then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis , called olivain , the lackey who had followed him from blois , and made him pack the valise under his own eyes , watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign . <EOS>	63.946228677926314
<SOS> at length , after occupying about an hour in these preparations , he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept , and entered . <EOS>	59.95711802605028
<SOS> the sun , already high , penetrated into the room through the window , the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening . <EOS>	100.21467188503223
<SOS> he was still sleeping , his head gracefully reposing on his arm . <EOS>	63.855577274817726
<SOS> athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy ; he looked long on this young man , whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber , as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection . <EOS>	60.777006861866695
<SOS> by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth , so pure , so fresh . <EOS>	95.01020492172222
<SOS> his own youth seemed to reappear , bringing with it all those savoury remembrances , which are like perfumes more than thoughts . <EOS>	61.06102968251876
<SOS> between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss . <EOS>	82.32995219322841
<SOS> but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked , the darkness in which our illusions are lost , the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up . <EOS>	93.14164193986387
<SOS> he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine , and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul . <EOS>	80.28357358320616
<SOS> in recalling all he had been through , he foresaw all that raoul might suffer ; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man . <EOS>	84.1193259552557
<SOS> at this moment raoul awoke , without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude ; his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress , for his glance , in return , had all the tenderness of love . <EOS>	98.78294069458774
<SOS> `` you are there , sir ? '' <EOS>	71.47048771900396
<SOS> he said , respectfully . <EOS>	78.10835506510213
<SOS> `` yes , raoul , '' replied the count . <EOS>	80.64822033319108
<SOS> `` and you did not awaken me ? '' <EOS>	100.87451741065469
<SOS> `` i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep , my child ; you must be fatigued from yesterday . '' <EOS>	116.49732932518266
<SOS> `` oh , sir , how good you are ! '' <EOS>	55.38760920418522
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	72.5770675208989
<SOS> `` how do you feel this morning ? '' <EOS>	108.04441965194535
<SOS> he inquired . <EOS>	61.41110627715258
<SOS> `` perfectly well ; quite rested , sir . '' <EOS>	98.69973927356752
<SOS> `` you are still growing , '' athos continued , with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth . <EOS>	69.54507408340736
<SOS> `` oh , sir , i beg your pardon ! '' <EOS>	119.20979689953394
<SOS> exclaimed raoul , ashamed of so much attention ; `` in an instant i shall be dressed . '' <EOS>	82.31737196966972
<SOS> athos then called olivain . <EOS>	104.70309912226497
<SOS> `` everything , '' said olivain to athos , `` has been done according to your directions ; the horses are waiting . '' <EOS>	95.14435242057206
<SOS> `` and i was asleep , '' cried raoul , `` whilst you , sir , you had the kindness to attend to all these details . <EOS>	122.90214719059011
<SOS> truly , sir , you overwhelm me with benefits ! '' <EOS>	76.69895806924691
<SOS> `` therefore you love me a little , i hope , '' replied athos , in a tone of emotion . <EOS>	118.70926478154841
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! <EOS>	55.77457027553347
<SOS> god knows how much i love , revere you . '' <EOS>	78.3533957093594
<SOS> `` see that you forget nothing , '' said athos , appearing to look about him , that he might hide his emotion . <EOS>	52.38698302537025
<SOS> `` no , indeed , sir , '' answered raoul . <EOS>	102.59961516250723
<SOS> the servant then approached athos and said , hesitatingly : `` monsieur le vicomte has no sword . '' <EOS>	69.37758991526944
<SOS> `` 't is well , '' said athos , `` i will take care of that . '' <EOS>	92.5251876051913
<SOS> they went downstairs , raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand , but athos was silent . <EOS>	82.55056289450205
<SOS> when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses . <EOS>	81.61311638613837
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! <EOS>	73.15396758831635
<SOS> then you are going with me ? '' <EOS>	79.42242199688917
<SOS> `` i will accompany you a portion of the way , '' said athos . <EOS>	106.56244328019316
<SOS> joy shone in raoul 's eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle . <EOS>	40.97727387035491
<SOS> athos mounted more slowly , after speaking in a low voice to the lackey , who , instead of following them immediately , returned to their rooms . <EOS>	46.16978934439423
<SOS> raoul , delighted at the count 's companionship , perceived , or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay . <EOS>	45.763962655144674
<SOS> they set out , passing over the pont neuf ; they pursued their way along the quay then called l'abreuvoir pepin , and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet . <EOS>	63.69947905624266
<SOS> they proceeded to the rue saint denis . <EOS>	92.32890874040962
<SOS> after passing through the porte saint denis , athos looked at raoul 's way of riding and observed : `` take care , raoul ! <EOS>	70.63399875884143
<SOS> i have already often told you of this ; you must not forget it , for it is a great defect in a rider . <EOS>	79.50200189322312
<SOS> see ! <EOS>	75.3514186381385
<SOS> your horse is tired already , he froths at the mouth , whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable . <EOS>	80.57685625327179
<SOS> you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard , so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly . <EOS>	50.216143082018135
<SOS> the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse . <EOS>	88.41368025052948
<SOS> in a week , remember , you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice , but on a field of battle . '' <EOS>	76.2403206388655
<SOS> then suddenly , in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation : `` see , raoul ! '' <EOS>	66.05705841131146
<SOS> he resumed ; `` what a fine plain for partridge shooting . '' <EOS>	61.1917858430262
<SOS> the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed . <EOS>	73.31304120290591
<SOS> `` i have remarked also another thing , '' said athos , `` which is , that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched . <EOS>	96.82474882675159
<SOS> this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim . <EOS>	94.73812118259204
<SOS> so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark . '' <EOS>	63.65482576777969
<SOS> `` which you , sir , struck twelve times , '' answered raoul , smiling . <EOS>	56.96669150817795
<SOS> `` because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so ; do you understand what i mean ? '' <EOS>	75.83473803490011
<SOS> `` yes , sir . <EOS>	65.00112215609603
<SOS> i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful . '' <EOS>	75.04795330751803
<SOS> `` what a cold wind ! '' <EOS>	78.92197842756272
<SOS> resumed athos ; `` a wintry blast . <EOS>	58.81131919142833
<SOS> apropos , if you fire and you will do so , for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat , which often takes place in the cavalry , never to fire the first shot . <EOS>	66.56417058820331
<SOS> he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man , for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed , before an armed foe ; then , whilst he fires , make your horse rear ; that manoeuvre has saved my life several times . '' <EOS>	71.3472844839304
<SOS> `` i shall do so , if only in gratitude `` `` eh ! '' <EOS>	67.23404125344734
<SOS> cried athos , `` are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder ? <EOS>	102.62122868476676
<SOS> they are . <EOS>	59.24936693509179
<SOS> then another important thing , raoul : should you be wounded in a battle , and fall from your horse , if you have any strength left , disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed ; otherwise , it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses . <EOS>	47.38262807263738
<SOS> at all events , should you be wounded , write to me that very instant , or get some one at once to write to me . <EOS>	43.752048543647014
<SOS> we are judges of wounds , we old soldiers , '' athos added , smiling . <EOS>	51.059917657482565
<SOS> `` thank you , sir , '' answered the young man , much moved . <EOS>	70.7573330471298
<SOS> they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town , guarded by two sentinels . <EOS>	81.53753623627149
<SOS> `` here comes a young gentleman , '' said one of them , `` who seems as if he were going to join the army . '' <EOS>	51.07836718865501
<SOS> `` how do you make that out ? '' <EOS>	102.30383937610688
<SOS> inquired athos . <EOS>	63.72472686676617
<SOS> `` by his manner , sir , and his age ; he 's the second to day . '' <EOS>	50.889711787451766
<SOS> `` has a young man , such as i am , gone through this morning , then ? '' <EOS>	93.24144920672259
<SOS> asked raoul . <EOS>	48.350070221834514
<SOS> `` faith , yes , with a haughty presence , a fine equipage ; such as the son of a noble house would have . '' <EOS>	59.883041756753116
<SOS> `` he will be my companion on the journey , sir , '' cried raoul . <EOS>	79.92190785601835
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	74.90036256617357
<SOS> he can not make me forget what i shall have lost ! '' <EOS>	53.84110536344812
<SOS> thus talking , they traversed the streets , full of people on account of the fete , and arrived opposite the old cathedral , where first mass was going on . <EOS>	61.71513201663697
<SOS> `` let us alight ; raoul , '' said athos . <EOS>	54.61288072280986
<SOS> `` olivain , take care of our horses and give me my sword . '' <EOS>	103.92987774747705
<SOS> the two gentlemen then went into the church . <EOS>	66.11936658450244
<SOS> athos gave raoul some of the holy water . <EOS>	89.49223059689749
<SOS> a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells , undoubtedly , in some paternal hearts toward a son . <EOS>	43.53497654884981
<SOS> athos said a word to one of the vergers , who bowed and proceeded toward the basement . <EOS>	75.97854476559063
<SOS> `` come , raoul , '' he said , `` let us follow this man . '' <EOS>	59.26160117664131
<SOS> the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step , whilst athos and raoul descended . <EOS>	60.43551448483445
<SOS> the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step ; and just below this lamp there was laid , wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet , worked with fleurs de lis of gold , a catafalque resting on trestles of oak . <EOS>	49.31366394773937
<SOS> the young man , prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings , which were mournful , and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through , descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king , who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there ; and who appeared to abide on that spot , that he might thus address human pride , so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne : `` dust of the earth ! <EOS>	98.94271250629289
<SOS> here i await thee ! '' <EOS>	85.27120222136793
<SOS> there was profound silence . <EOS>	47.24449219995727
<SOS> then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin : `` this temporary sepulture is , '' he said , `` that of a man who was of feeble mind , yet one whose reign was full of great events ; because over this king watched the spirit of another man , even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it . <EOS>	70.60069331035476
<SOS> he whose intellect was thus supreme , raoul , was the actual sovereign ; the other , nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul ; and yet , so powerful is majesty amongst us , this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away . <EOS>	77.12755098254921
<SOS> remember , raoul , this ! <EOS>	68.18286280454629
<SOS> if richelieu made the king , by comparison , seem small , he made royalty great . <EOS>	45.14192007247301
<SOS> the palace of the louvre contains two things the king , who must die , and royalty , which never dies . <EOS>	60.00712483180635
<SOS> the minister , so feared , so hated by his master , has descended into the tomb , drawing after him the king , whom he would not leave alone on earth , lest his work should be destroyed . <EOS>	72.22934400582585
<SOS> so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal 's death as a deliverance ; and i , even i , opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand . <EOS>	56.145354834692384
<SOS> raoul , learn how to distinguish the king from royalty ; the king is but a man ; royalty is the gift of god . <EOS>	75.1469792036392
<SOS> whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve , abandon the exterior , the material appearance for the invisible principle , for the invisible principle is everything . <EOS>	108.98629328466765
<SOS> raoul , i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud . <EOS>	120.58454690831027
<SOS> it will be happier , i think , than ours has been . <EOS>	40.53224267873329
<SOS> different in your fate from us , you will have a king without a minister , whom you may serve , love , respect . <EOS>	77.8710148990656
<SOS> should the king prove a tyrant , for power begets tyranny , serve , love , respect royalty , that divine right , that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy , so that we gentlemen , nevertheless , of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended . '' <EOS>	51.678538745479
<SOS> `` i shall adore god , sir , '' said raoul , `` respect royalty and ever serve the king . <EOS>	101.74819981338355
<SOS> and if death be my lot , i hope to die for the king , for royalty and for god . <EOS>	97.4997418315113
<SOS> have i , sir , comprehended your instructions ? '' <EOS>	69.37595387874437
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	99.41823016943954
<SOS> `` yours is a noble nature . '' <EOS>	53.64942636464971
<SOS> he said ; `` here is your sword . '' <EOS>	68.83892444894951
<SOS> raoul bent his knee to the ground . <EOS>	79.66938839911221
<SOS> `` it was worn by my father , a loyal gentleman . <EOS>	105.96572778163586
<SOS> i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side . <EOS>	98.94559808520405
<SOS> should your hand still be too weak to use this sword , raoul , so much the better . <EOS>	105.22721212326321
<SOS> you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used . '' <EOS>	73.56252734090232
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied raoul , putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count , `` i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me . <EOS>	53.3295872662595
<SOS> i will wear it , i swear to you , as a grateful man should do . '' <EOS>	84.03540107483603
<SOS> `` 't is well ; arise , vicomte , embrace me . '' <EOS>	41.5581348055816
<SOS> raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count 's arms . <EOS>	60.02426023545723
<SOS> `` adieu , '' faltered the count , who felt his heart die away within him ; `` adieu , and think of me . '' <EOS>	102.73198576664785
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	71.21002341584126
<SOS> for ever and ever ! '' <EOS>	77.06702863558958
<SOS> cried the youth ; `` oh ! <EOS>	44.997804470532174
<SOS> i swear to you , sir , should any harm befall me , your name will be the last name that i shall utter , the remembrance of you my last thought . '' <EOS>	59.816050731453736
<SOS> athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion , and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses . <EOS>	78.65997344523434
<SOS> `` olivain , '' said athos , showing the servant raoul 's shoulder belt , `` tighten the buckle of the sword , it falls too low . <EOS>	76.72800238902907
<SOS> you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you . <EOS>	110.0491562036267
<SOS> you know , raoul , grimaud is an old and zealous servant ; he will follow you . '' <EOS>	92.81375537955688
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' answered raoul . <EOS>	62.245317199796325
<SOS> `` now to horse , that i may see you depart ! '' <EOS>	71.97445233955267
<SOS> raoul obeyed . <EOS>	93.97651005289264
<SOS> `` adieu , raoul , '' said the count ; `` adieu , my dearest boy ! '' <EOS>	81.62435533785023
<SOS> `` adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector . '' <EOS>	66.98671250635539
<SOS> athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak : and raoul went away , his head uncovered . <EOS>	82.31678358350894
<SOS> athos remained motionless , looking after him until he turned the corner of the street . <EOS>	84.42636603175826
<SOS> then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant , remounted the steps , went into the cathedral , there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray . <EOS>	93.60083266122456
<SOS> chapter xxiii . <EOS>	41.282637341152274
<SOS> one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort . <EOS>	80.77906877906598
<SOS> meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner , as well as for those who were preparing his escape ; only for him it passed more slowly . <EOS>	95.99037708388339
<SOS> unlike other men , who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches , the duc de beaufort , whose buoyant courage had become a proverb , seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action . <EOS>	80.87538039242695
<SOS> in his escape alone , apart from his plans for the future , which , it must be admitted , were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain , there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart . <EOS>	81.06343131198318
<SOS> in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny , whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him . <EOS>	58.4667993726666
<SOS> it would be a still worse affair for mazarin , whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed . <EOS>	64.17984985175076
<SOS> it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master . <EOS>	89.15412028330938
<SOS> then monsieur de beaufort , who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal , though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal , pictured to himself , in his prison , all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister 's cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria : `` monsieur de beaufort has escaped ! '' <EOS>	101.86277501212108
<SOS> whilst saying that to himself , monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside , breathing the air of the plains and the forests , pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice , `` i am free ! '' <EOS>	70.48471861761803
<SOS> it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls ; he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him , and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber . <EOS>	91.37915639839063
<SOS> the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud , for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope . <EOS>	53.274604878102885
<SOS> grimaud seemed to him an antinous . <EOS>	92.3452389512859
<SOS> it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner 's feverish imagination . <EOS>	80.10970881910222
<SOS> grimaud was still the same , and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior , la ramee , who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself , for , as we have said , la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort . <EOS>	60.37185212634964
<SOS> and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner . <EOS>	75.82334640141148
<SOS> he had but one fault he was a gourmand ; he had found the pates good , the wine excellent . <EOS>	85.7531990206462
<SOS> now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl , and chambertin wine instead of macon . <EOS>	92.7090198320234
<SOS> all this , set off by the presence of that excellent prince , who was so good natured , who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin , made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year . <EOS>	90.2602774129195
<SOS> he therefore looked forward to six o'clock with as much impatience as the duke himself . <EOS>	88.27501839911874
<SOS> since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations , and trusting no one but himself , he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau . <EOS>	45.42211979464026
<SOS> the latter had surpassed himself ; he showed la ramee a monstrous pate , ornamented with monsieur de beaufort 's coat of arms . <EOS>	81.11111831450856
<SOS> it was empty as yet , but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it . <EOS>	82.19492807760747
<SOS> la ramee 's mouth watered and he returned to the duke 's chamber rubbing his hands . <EOS>	56.82904064870973
<SOS> to crown his happiness , monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau . <EOS>	101.67695868634641
<SOS> as for grimaud , he seemed more sullen than ever . <EOS>	78.04551740853812
<SOS> in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee ; a sign from grimaud put him on the alert . <EOS>	72.941798286107
<SOS> grimaud , going in advance , followed the course which they were to take in the evening . <EOS>	81.79571250724058
<SOS> the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau , a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing ; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous , the wall was so high . <EOS>	54.99806227479632
<SOS> there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure , each by a different key . <EOS>	82.26849444947807
<SOS> when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall , letting his legs dangle outside . <EOS>	74.93251806777621
<SOS> it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached . <EOS>	71.0389804830274
<SOS> this manoeuvre , transparent to the duc de beaufort , was quite unintelligible to la ramee . <EOS>	52.41393807094185
<SOS> the game at tennis , which , upon a sign from grimaud , monsieur de beaufort had consented to play , began in the afternoon . <EOS>	51.30491508454269
<SOS> the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely . <EOS>	66.12505037662706
<SOS> four of the guards , who were constantly near the prisoner , assisted in picking up the tennis balls . <EOS>	68.35930126216363
<SOS> when the game was over , the duke , laughing at la ramee for his bad play , offered these men two louis d'or to go and drink his health , with their four other comrades . <EOS>	73.0780928540493
<SOS> the guards asked permission of la ramee , who gave it to them , but not till the evening , however ; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone . <EOS>	64.99631193126419
<SOS> six o'clock came and , although they were not to sit down to table until seven o'clock , dinner was ready and served up . <EOS>	42.882762694454335
<SOS> upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke 's arms on it , and seemingly cooked to a turn , as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust . <EOS>	58.117771114675335
<SOS> the rest of the dinner was to come . <EOS>	88.76350775889364
<SOS> every one was impatient , la ramee to sit down to table , the guards to go and drink , the duke to escape . <EOS>	71.63582253632141
<SOS> grimaud alone was calm as ever . <EOS>	75.26174504669537
<SOS> one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event . <EOS>	59.10199925243827
<SOS> there were moments when , looking at grimaud , the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action . <EOS>	99.57167588063741
<SOS> la ramee sent away the guards , desiring them to drink to the duke 's health , and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors , put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified : `` whenever my lord pleases . '' <EOS>	81.24183306891778
<SOS> the prince looked at grimaud , grimaud looked at the clock ; it was hardly a quarter past six . <EOS>	42.390760417998465
<SOS> the escape was fixed to take place at seven o'clock ; there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait . <EOS>	82.79493252120388
<SOS> the duke , in order to pass away another quarter of an hour , pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter . <EOS>	69.50446148772492
<SOS> la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner . <EOS>	68.59050702932359
<SOS> it was `` caesar 's commentaries , '' which la ramee had lent him , contrary to the orders of the governor ; and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions . <EOS>	86.9775865994516
<SOS> meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good . <EOS>	87.04210271495113
<SOS> at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely : `` certainly , caesar was the greatest man of ancient times . '' <EOS>	76.74684166883681
<SOS> `` you think so , my lord ? '' <EOS>	84.19252904663355
<SOS> answered la ramee . <EOS>	88.40800379698908
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	87.50978157008603
<SOS> `` well , as for me , i prefer hannibal . '' <EOS>	74.73170035957965
<SOS> `` and why , pray , master la ramee ? '' <EOS>	66.6566364648145
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	119.43427617873459
<SOS> `` because he left no commentaries , '' replied la ramee , with his coarse laugh . <EOS>	78.28466245412199
<SOS> the duke vouchsafed no reply , but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite . <EOS>	120.28963492041925
<SOS> there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table , so la ramee , when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud , presented a type of perfect bliss . <EOS>	95.08811509901221
<SOS> the duke smiled . <EOS>	78.81832970753564
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	98.59772488504389
<SOS> he said ; `` i do n't suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself ! '' <EOS>	74.94960094969834
<SOS> `` you are right , my lord duke , '' answered the officer ; `` i do n't know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table ; and when , added to that , he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv. , you will , my lord duke , easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys . '' <EOS>	78.82720150709376
<SOS> the duke , in his turn , bowed , and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud , who kept behind la ramee . <EOS>	79.27331932822827
<SOS> `` my dear la ramee , '' said the duke , `` you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments . '' <EOS>	80.74739780674778
<SOS> `` no , my lord duke , '' replied la ramee , in the fullness of his heart ; `` i say what i think ; there is no compliment in what i say to you `` `` then you are attached to me ? '' <EOS>	58.22930535675032
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	50.41230500513945
<SOS> `` to own the truth , i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes . '' <EOS>	73.06088866529731
<SOS> `` a droll way of showing your affliction . '' <EOS>	78.55809909741623
<SOS> the duke meant to say `` affection . '' <EOS>	85.26327152817522
<SOS> `` but , my lord , '' returned la ramee , `` what would you do if you got out ? <EOS>	56.85828872148856
<SOS> every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile , instead of vincennes . <EOS>	66.60131481676116
<SOS> now , monsieur de chavigny is not amiable , i allow , but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse . '' <EOS>	93.7045878059052
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	111.63448552716228
<SOS> exclaimed the duke , who from time to time looked at the clock , the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness . <EOS>	80.89566890105432
<SOS> `` but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk , brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu ? <EOS>	60.10854100304233
<SOS> ah , my lord , it is a great happiness that the queen , who always wished you well , had a fancy to send you here , where there 's a promenade and a tennis court , good air , and a good table . '' <EOS>	75.25335131843275
<SOS> `` in short , '' answered the duke , `` if i comprehend you aright , la ramee , i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place ? '' <EOS>	78.67734250386434
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	105.67215498172719
<SOS> my lord duke , 't is the height of ingratitude ; but your highness has never seriously thought of it ? '' <EOS>	68.01239912708553
<SOS> `` yes , '' returned the duke , `` i must confess i sometimes think of it . '' <EOS>	72.59141195679437
<SOS> `` still by one of your forty methods , your highness ? '' <EOS>	108.27054225699386
<SOS> `` yes , yes , indeed . '' <EOS>	80.5525853453398
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said la ramee , `` now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves , pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness . '' <EOS>	96.26837977434103
<SOS> `` willingly , '' answered the duke , `` give me the pie ! '' <EOS>	88.70181006549987
<SOS> `` i am listening , '' said la ramee , leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips , and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste . <EOS>	76.87988978466048
<SOS> the duke glanced at the clock . <EOS>	68.89002954980836
<SOS> in ten minutes it would strike seven . <EOS>	67.86022261776077
<SOS> grimaud placed the pie before the duke , who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust ; but la ramee , who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art , passed his knife , which had an iron blade , to the duke . <EOS>	90.95193414294623
<SOS> `` thank you , la ramee , '' said the prisoner . <EOS>	52.53503977824879
<SOS> `` well , my lord ! <EOS>	99.33407617256303
<SOS> this famous invention of yours ? '' <EOS>	67.82250541145643
<SOS> `` must i tell you , '' replied the duke , `` on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first ? '' <EOS>	91.85745299566372
<SOS> `` yes , that 's the thing , my lord ! '' <EOS>	66.0257994885542
<SOS> cried his custodian , gaily . <EOS>	109.29398170236271
<SOS> `` well , i should hope , in the first instance , to have for keeper an honest fellow like you . '' <EOS>	85.17080170462165
<SOS> `` and you have me , my lord . <EOS>	91.3716392809083
<SOS> well ? '' <EOS>	65.69106710425787
<SOS> `` having , then , a keeper like la ramee , i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me , who would assist me in my flight . '' <EOS>	108.39924044730952
<SOS> `` come , come , '' said la ramee , `` that 's not a bad idea . '' <EOS>	47.61829064218709
<SOS> `` capital , is n't it ? <EOS>	51.59801010574868
<SOS> for instance , the former servingman of some brave gentleman , an enemy himself to mazarin , as every gentleman ought to be . '' <EOS>	91.1248077599034
<SOS> `` hush ! <EOS>	70.08138145995248
<SOS> do n't let us talk politics , my lord . '' <EOS>	48.440581516708605
<SOS> `` then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him , and i should have news from those without the prison walls . '' <EOS>	47.49543184941194
<SOS> `` ah , yes ! <EOS>	59.18051013347638
<SOS> but how can the news be brought to you ? '' <EOS>	77.2121810474432
<SOS> `` nothing easier ; in a game of tennis , for example . '' <EOS>	68.0982585152979
<SOS> `` in a game of tennis ? '' <EOS>	55.97315229610039
<SOS> asked la ramee , giving more serious attention to the duke 's words . <EOS>	66.3513036011932
<SOS> `` yes ; see , i send a ball into the moat ; a man is there who picks it up ; the ball contains a letter . <EOS>	72.66628452857695
<SOS> instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall , he throws me another ; that other ball contains a letter . <EOS>	83.41623766678683
<SOS> thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it . '' <EOS>	57.870999213715365
<SOS> `` the devil it does ! <EOS>	92.63559451257514
<SOS> the devil it does ! '' <EOS>	100.18740446911772
<SOS> said la ramee , scratching his head ; `` you are in the wrong to tell me that , my lord . <EOS>	75.8694350454645
<SOS> i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls . '' <EOS>	71.17121511990409
<SOS> the duke smiled . <EOS>	50.294506312417724
<SOS> `` but , '' resumed la ramee , `` that is only a way of corresponding . '' <EOS>	70.80953424711119
<SOS> `` and that is a great deal , it seems to me . '' <EOS>	49.459416366450405
<SOS> `` but not enough . '' <EOS>	114.41941359286788
<SOS> `` pardon me ; for instance , i say to my friends , be on a certain day , on a certain hour , at the other side of the moat with two horses . '' <EOS>	59.17552733076211
<SOS> `` well , what then ? '' <EOS>	60.85339763264847
<SOS> la ramee began to be uneasy ; `` unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you . '' <EOS>	54.75193142084094
<SOS> `` that 's not needed . <EOS>	61.27778534426063
<SOS> i have , '' replied the duke , `` a way of descending from the ramparts . '' <EOS>	66.24751257142822
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	67.80859564761468
<SOS> `` a rope ladder . '' <EOS>	68.32388206862684
<SOS> `` yes , but , '' answered la ramee , trying to laugh , `` a ladder of ropes ca n't be sent around a ball , like a letter . '' <EOS>	70.23971539314445
<SOS> `` no , but it may be sent in something else . '' <EOS>	69.69068189107034
<SOS> `` in something else in something else ? <EOS>	66.17064158952536

<SOS> `` in a pate ? '' <EOS>	102.35388040438511
<SOS> said la ramee . <EOS>	58.179650768610614
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	62.74490292057996
<SOS> let us suppose one thing , '' replied the duke `` let us suppose , for instance , that my maitre d'hotel , noirmont , has purchased the shop of pere marteau `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	99.33574919060443
<SOS> said la ramee , shuddering . <EOS>	78.52154719400086
<SOS> `` well , la ramee , who is a gourmand , sees his pates , thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them . <EOS>	57.837365895210375
<SOS> i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me . <EOS>	105.03473338241068
<SOS> that we may be more at our ease , la ramee removes the guards , keeping only grimaud to wait on us . <EOS>	120.07157678360511
<SOS> grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything . <EOS>	58.68388592545848
<SOS> the moment for my escape is fixed seven o'clock . <EOS>	89.28664376007657
<SOS> well , at a few minutes to seven `` `` at a few minutes to seven ? '' <EOS>	62.90693736969316
<SOS> cried la ramee , cold sweat upon his brow . <EOS>	88.70881662467978
<SOS> `` at a few minutes to seven , '' returned the duke ( suiting the action to the words ) , `` i raise the crust of the pie ; i find in it two poniards , a ladder of rope , and a gag . <EOS>	62.35831286895429
<SOS> i point one of the poniards at la ramee 's breast and i say to him , 'my friend , i am sorry for it , but if thou stirrest , if thou utterest one cry , thou art a dead man ! ' '' <EOS>	69.3161295380337
<SOS> the duke , in pronouncing these words , suited , as we have said , the action to the words . <EOS>	62.607076432280955
<SOS> he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner , close to la ramee 's heart , that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination . <EOS>	72.65974567766722
<SOS> meanwhile , grimaud , still mute as ever , drew from the pie the other poniard , the rope ladder and the gag . <EOS>	80.03108266801082
<SOS> la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes , his alarm every moment increasing . <EOS>	59.84564788746174
<SOS> `` oh , my lord , '' he cried , with an expression of stupefaction in his face ; `` you have n't the heart to kill me ! '' <EOS>	56.27258830272191
<SOS> `` no ; not if thou dost not oppose my flight . '' <EOS>	90.17209277935173
<SOS> `` but , my lord , if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man . '' <EOS>	80.1105503108119
<SOS> `` i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place . '' <EOS>	70.0793488159894
<SOS> `` you are determined to leave the chateau ? '' <EOS>	63.76455583364379
<SOS> `` by heaven and earth ! <EOS>	47.64578074248529
<SOS> this night i am determined to be free . '' <EOS>	64.61028548221701
<SOS> `` and if i defend myself , or call , or cry out ? '' <EOS>	63.407980370378574
<SOS> `` i will kill thee , on the honor of a gentleman . '' <EOS>	80.60757340140775
<SOS> at this moment the clock struck . <EOS>	74.70945975837047
<SOS> `` seven o'clock ! '' <EOS>	106.4268677906919
<SOS> said grimaud , who had not spoken a word . <EOS>	74.97767854920338
<SOS> la ramee made one movement , in order to satisfy his conscience . <EOS>	92.3539519462185
<SOS> the duke frowned , the officer felt the point of the poniard , which , having penetrated through his clothes , was close to his heart . <EOS>	105.48119782801975
<SOS> `` let us dispatch , '' said the duke . <EOS>	87.134425845933
<SOS> `` my lord , one last favor . '' <EOS>	71.09489909336469
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	91.06379182687019
<SOS> speak , make haste . '' <EOS>	61.23626659811661
<SOS> `` bind my arms , my lord , fast . '' <EOS>	67.78543043170933
<SOS> `` why bind thee ? '' <EOS>	78.24225590176704
<SOS> `` that i may not be considered as your accomplice . '' <EOS>	81.14855754238755
<SOS> `` your hands ? '' <EOS>	47.23915787115759
<SOS> asked grimaud . <EOS>	60.327387466110714
<SOS> `` not before me , behind me . '' <EOS>	84.68389666205262
<SOS> `` but with what ? '' <EOS>	109.7124857889552
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	76.69854949896282
<SOS> `` with your belt , my lord ! '' <EOS>	47.12780186468615
<SOS> replied la ramee . <EOS>	69.97865103352227
<SOS> the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud , who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him . <EOS>	68.47667572242534
<SOS> `` your feet , too , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	65.90150333088707
<SOS> la ramee stretched out his legs , grimaud took a table cloth , tore it into strips and tied la ramee 's feet together . <EOS>	89.98140830444191
<SOS> `` now , my lord , '' said the poor man , `` let me have the poire d'angoisse . <EOS>	66.65157461511203
<SOS> i ask for it ; without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm . <EOS>	66.55435195215291
<SOS> thrust it into my mouth , my lord , thrust it in . '' <EOS>	70.07688177878101
<SOS> grimaud prepared to comply with this request , when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say . <EOS>	66.267341413979
<SOS> `` speak , '' said the duke . <EOS>	76.44771198017324
<SOS> `` now , my lord , do not forget , if any harm happens to me on your account , that i have a wife and four children . '' <EOS>	105.42127449082771
<SOS> `` rest assured ; put the gag in , grimaud . '' <EOS>	54.53402484509815
<SOS> in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate . <EOS>	88.8164803770674
<SOS> two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle . <EOS>	67.45637671291855
<SOS> grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were , then shut it and double locked it , and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure . <EOS>	79.66238291035465
<SOS> at last they reached the tennis court . <EOS>	56.05438004872592
<SOS> it was completely deserted . <EOS>	70.0199091472778
<SOS> no sentinels , no one at any of the windows . <EOS>	89.84052295666615
<SOS> the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch , three cavaliers with two riding horses . <EOS>	63.96025350126947
<SOS> the duke exchanged a signal with them . <EOS>	95.88156664508688
<SOS> it was indeed for him that they were there . <EOS>	70.91707122020519
<SOS> grimaud , meantime , undid the means of escape . <EOS>	80.60118993649796
<SOS> this was not , however , a rope ladder , but a ball of silk cord , with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs , the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board . <EOS>	115.28119148921046
<SOS> `` go ! '' <EOS>	52.34202395809235
<SOS> said the duke . <EOS>	68.38114456031623
<SOS> `` first , my lord ? '' <EOS>	87.72204737635343
<SOS> inquired grimaud . <EOS>	47.23705086155113
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	78.42480895152842
<SOS> if i am caught , i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison . <EOS>	62.70431940588377
<SOS> if they catch thee , thou wilt be hung . '' <EOS>	78.14573363508782
<SOS> `` true , '' replied grimaud . <EOS>	54.99176550883558
<SOS> and instantly , grimaud , sitting upon the board as if on horseback , commenced his perilous descent . <EOS>	72.80764603717957
<SOS> the duke followed him with his eyes , with involuntary terror . <EOS>	77.83011720872472
<SOS> he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke . <EOS>	53.481035272930725
<SOS> grimaud fell precipitated into the moat . <EOS>	74.043201297121
<SOS> the duke uttered a cry , but grimaud did not give a single moan . <EOS>	112.48583293650665
<SOS> he must have been dreadfully hurt , for he did not stir from the place where he fell . <EOS>	71.49200603441469
<SOS> immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat , tied under grimaud 's shoulders the end of a cord , and the remaining two , who held the other end , drew grimaud to them . <EOS>	122.27142070879854
<SOS> `` descend , my lord , '' said the man in the moat . <EOS>	120.55197362112362
<SOS> `` there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here , and the grass is soft . '' <EOS>	86.60909488121725
<SOS> the duke had already begun to descend . <EOS>	80.71783079909288
<SOS> his task was the more difficult , as there was no board to support him . <EOS>	57.91446578962284
<SOS> he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet . <EOS>	50.8840196319199
<SOS> but as we have said he was active , strong , and full of presence of mind . <EOS>	52.35797171975798
<SOS> in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord . <EOS>	95.69118830641806
<SOS> he was then only fifteen feet from the ground , as the gentlemen below had told him . <EOS>	70.20998376702872
<SOS> he let go the rope and fell upon his feet , without receiving any injury . <EOS>	57.7228684431314
<SOS> he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat , on the top of which he met de rochefort . <EOS>	83.12048388196956
<SOS> the other two gentlemen were unknown to him . <EOS>	104.32623085213041
<SOS> grimaud , in a swoon , was tied securely to a horse . <EOS>	78.61035896119886
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the duke , `` i will thank you later ; now we have not a moment to lose . <EOS>	58.78576993372334
<SOS> on , then ! <EOS>	45.052985130051916
<SOS> on ! <EOS>	62.010550148768814
<SOS> those who love me , follow me ! '' <EOS>	85.61217737337056
<SOS> and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop , snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out , with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe : `` free ! <EOS>	66.27050805982947
<SOS> free ! <EOS>	76.19739394355781
<SOS> free ! '' <EOS>	61.415973772074366
<SOS> chapter xxiv . <EOS>	93.63066278342181
<SOS> the timely arrival of d'artagnan in paris . <EOS>	105.55179592114516
<SOS> at blois , d'artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal . <EOS>	57.42689954178405
<SOS> from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers , but d'artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis . <EOS>	91.09902483959073
<SOS> in turning the corner of the rue montmartre , in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette , where he had appointed porthos to meet him , he saw at one of the windows of the hotel , that friend himself dressed in a sky blue waistcoat , embroidered with silver , and gaping , till he showed every one of his white teeth ; whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman , so handsome and so rich , who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness . <EOS>	54.43850831564738
<SOS> d'artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them . <EOS>	44.4056198133201
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	91.30374531226482
<SOS> d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	116.58742406127406
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	44.24733036812882
<SOS> `` thank god you have come ! '' <EOS>	76.52433633469118
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	74.48017699404646
<SOS> good day , dear friend ! '' <EOS>	92.52762443652192
<SOS> replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	117.9347691476373
<SOS> porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel . <EOS>	55.87258610431278
<SOS> `` ah , my dear friend ! '' <EOS>	58.30683742682513
<SOS> he cried , `` what bad stabling for my horses here . '' <EOS>	83.56385544339133
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	56.46850956426956
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` i am most unhappy to hear it , on account of those fine animals . '' <EOS>	121.25422919820868
<SOS> `` and i , also i was also wretchedly off , '' he answered , moving backward and forward as he spoke ; `` and had it not been for the hostess , '' he added , with his air of vulgar self complacency , `` who is very agreeable and understands a joke , i should have got a lodging elsewhere . '' <EOS>	90.04402978747785
<SOS> the pretty madeleine , who had approached during this colloquy , stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos 's words , for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated . <EOS>	53.91335250309303
<SOS> but to her great surprise d'artagnan remained perfectly calm , and instead of being angry he laughed , and said to porthos : `` yes , i understand , the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds ; but console yourself , i will soon conduct you to one much better . '' <EOS>	78.9004564707463
<SOS> `` when will you do that ? '' <EOS>	67.01551220360892
<SOS> `` immediately , i hope . '' <EOS>	74.22656861000345
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	119.23815579928169
<SOS> so much the better ! '' <EOS>	97.79359011081209
<SOS> to that exclamation of porthos 's succeeded a groaning , low and profound , which seemed to come from behind a door . <EOS>	63.069811412356444
<SOS> d'artagnan , who had just dismounted , then saw , outlined against the wall , the enormous stomach of mousqueton , whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress . <EOS>	65.82116074394034
<SOS> `` and you , too , my poor monsieur mouston , are out of place in this poor hotel , are you not ? '' <EOS>	69.83773799882619
<SOS> asked d'artagnan , in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery . <EOS>	67.00714040677188
<SOS> `` he finds the cooking detestable , '' replied porthos . <EOS>	112.00731634323483
<SOS> `` why , then , does n't he attend to it himself , as at chantilly ? '' <EOS>	91.94565851616704
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur , i have not here , as i had there , the ponds of monsieur le prince , where i could catch those beautiful carp , nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges . <EOS>	68.9467767185526
<SOS> as for the cellar , i have searched every part and poor stuff i found . '' <EOS>	100.86533882482101
<SOS> `` monsieur mouston , '' said d'artagnan , `` i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to . '' <EOS>	94.17800034481091
<SOS> then taking porthos aside : `` my dear du vallon , '' he said , `` here you are in full dress most fortunately , for i am going to take you to the cardinal 's . '' <EOS>	62.68757555540656
<SOS> `` gracious me ! <EOS>	104.04444164451301
<SOS> really ! '' <EOS>	92.81420571621467
<SOS> exclaimed porthos , opening his great wondering eyes . <EOS>	84.78945872613203
<SOS> `` yes , my friend . '' <EOS>	99.2856026665803
<SOS> `` a presentation ? <EOS>	105.04186163725693

<SOS> `` no , but it agitates me . '' <EOS>	53.41751244119194

<SOS> `` indeed , '' said porthos , looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away , `` you are right , d'artagnan ; mouston will do ; mouston has a very fine appearance . '' <EOS>	67.99667093257686
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled . <EOS>	76.80010108918137

<SOS> `` no , i shall go as i am . <EOS>	88.89291269367466
<SOS> this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands . '' <EOS>	90.11605623884782
<SOS> they set out on vulcan and bayard , followed by mousqueton on phoebus , and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven . <EOS>	84.00419904512123
<SOS> the streets were crowded , for it was the day of pentecost , and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers ; one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox , the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle . <EOS>	65.071581097889
<SOS> mousqueton also attracted attention ; and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion , they said that he was sancho , who , after having lost one master , had found two . <EOS>	114.80604516473053
<SOS> on reaching the palace , d'artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay . <EOS>	68.93527965445065
<SOS> he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal . <EOS>	111.95641638251024
<SOS> `` courage ! '' <EOS>	53.45637363275404

<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	64.46545242865227
<SOS> mazarin was in his study , working at a list of pensions and benefices , of which he was trying to reduce the number . <EOS>	43.6730286004072
<SOS> he saw d'artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure , yet showed no joy in his countenance . <EOS>	63.096495285532995

<SOS> welcome to ye . '' <EOS>	77.01998178845248

<SOS> here i am at your eminence 's service , as well as monsieur du vallon , one of my old friends , who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos . '' <EOS>	67.43238814135738
<SOS> porthos bowed to the cardinal . <EOS>	60.42872811412524
<SOS> `` a magnificent cavalier , '' remarked mazarin . <EOS>	65.10105058897206
<SOS> porthos turned his head to the right and to the left , and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity . <EOS>	52.04043537270818
<SOS> `` the best swordsman in the kingdom , my lord , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	88.54945869836789
<SOS> porthos bowed to his friend . <EOS>	85.01022295981561
<SOS> mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as , in later times , frederick of prussia used to be . <EOS>	98.46181767322737
<SOS> he admired the strong hands , the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos . <EOS>	79.43644131350437
<SOS> he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom , sculptured in flesh and bone . <EOS>	80.59334909863831
<SOS> he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons . <EOS>	58.25748812846728
<SOS> `` and your two other friends ? '' <EOS>	84.30769034575555
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	81.10926196854473
<SOS> porthos opened his mouth , thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn ; d'artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye . <EOS>	63.2444546149633
<SOS> `` they are prevented at this moment , but will join us later . '' <EOS>	54.134614935771836
<SOS> mazarin coughed a little . <EOS>	76.58428424643385
<SOS> `` and this gentleman , being disengaged , takes to the service willingly ? '' <EOS>	58.990781000174714
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	93.6085826596169
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , and from pure devotion to the cause , for monsieur de bracieux is rich . '' <EOS>	44.27811567742055
<SOS> `` rich ! '' <EOS>	51.235604219772895
<SOS> said mazarin , whom that single word always inspired with a great respect . <EOS>	69.79692900133254
<SOS> `` fifty thousand francs a year , '' said porthos . <EOS>	81.94081247386084
<SOS> these were the first words he had spoken . <EOS>	69.98714574513464
<SOS> `` from pure zeal ? '' <EOS>	68.59272739603412
<SOS> resumed mazarin , with his artful smile ; `` from pure zeal and devotion then ? '' <EOS>	62.06865085766083
<SOS> `` my lord has , perhaps , no faith in those words ? '' <EOS>	56.20792155076185
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	84.86925030121411
<SOS> `` have you , monsieur le gascon ? '' <EOS>	68.73133828861666
<SOS> asked mazarin , supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands . <EOS>	49.60393251427941
<SOS> `` i , '' replied the gascon , `` i believe in devotion as a word at one 's baptism , for instance , which naturally comes before one 's proper name ; every one is naturally more or less devout , certainly ; but there should be at the end of one 's devotion something to gain . '' <EOS>	64.6298859220481
<SOS> `` and your friend , for instance ; what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion ? '' <EOS>	80.84872898513763
<SOS> `` well , my lord , my friend has three magnificent estates : that of vallon , at corbeil ; that of bracieux , in the soissonais ; and that of pierrefonds , in the valois . <EOS>	96.2498615189361
<SOS> now , my lord , he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony . '' <EOS>	86.75016747098401
<SOS> `` only that ? '' <EOS>	114.27011571524675
<SOS> said mazarin , his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for porthos 's devotion without opening his purse ; `` only that ? <EOS>	62.42425304145201
<SOS> that can be managed . '' <EOS>	108.1413811719264
<SOS> `` i shall be baron ! '' <EOS>	47.26625731701136
<SOS> explained porthos , stepping forward . <EOS>	97.53198930181077
<SOS> `` i told you so , '' said d'artagnan , checking him with his hand ; `` and now his eminence confirms it . '' <EOS>	74.07036307606535
<SOS> `` and you , monsieur d'artagnan , what do you want ? '' <EOS>	42.75463962454298
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant . '' <EOS>	122.04324458897958
<SOS> `` yes , and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain . '' <EOS>	104.09506569894383
<SOS> d'artagnan bowed . <EOS>	99.96122180354264
<SOS> `` well , that is not impossible . <EOS>	115.14309916888436
<SOS> we will see , gentlemen , we will see . <EOS>	84.24015915945606
<SOS> now , monsieur de vallon , '' said mazarin , `` what service do you prefer , in the town or in the country ? '' <EOS>	102.19048421425052
<SOS> porthos opened his mouth to reply . <EOS>	100.44903982889426
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` monsieur de vallon is like me , he prefers service extraordinary that is to say , enterprises that are considered mad and impossible . '' <EOS>	52.01975998853182
<SOS> that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin ; he fell into meditation . <EOS>	90.65139014028632
<SOS> `` and yet , '' he said , `` i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service ; i have certain apprehensions well , what is the meaning of that ? '' <EOS>	115.00558582484805
<SOS> in fact , a great noise was heard in the ante chamber ; at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man , covered with dust , rushed into it , exclaiming : `` my lord the cardinal ! <EOS>	108.69999313469623
<SOS> my lord the cardinal ! '' <EOS>	81.15775364333142
<SOS> mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back , pushing his chair on the castors . <EOS>	80.65586125953868
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal . <EOS>	84.32119860495241
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' exclaimed mazarin , `` what 's the matter ? <EOS>	46.652340903370515
<SOS> and why do you rush in here , as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place ? '' <EOS>	87.86737777050615
<SOS> `` my lord , '' replied the messenger , `` i wish to speak to your eminence in secret . <EOS>	92.26955624559636
<SOS> i am monsieur du poins , an officer in the guards , on duty at the donjon of vincennes . '' <EOS>	75.35815195374495
<SOS> mazarin , perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say , made a sign that d'artagnan and porthos should give place . <EOS>	49.08441231782311
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet . <EOS>	106.03747498236994
<SOS> `` speak , monsieur , speak at once ! '' <EOS>	103.71385236007694
<SOS> said mazarin `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	70.20459775197781
<SOS> `` the matter is , my lord , that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the chateau of vincennes . '' <EOS>	89.39174544580992
<SOS> mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news . <EOS>	93.97186584540015
<SOS> he fell back , almost fainting , in his chair . <EOS>	103.06567208467116
<SOS> `` escaped ? <EOS>	65.15886949383047
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort escaped ? '' <EOS>	102.83096692829747
<SOS> `` my lord , i saw him run off from the top of the terrace . '' <EOS>	80.00318251537125
<SOS> `` and you did not fire on him ? '' <EOS>	63.823904999699415
<SOS> `` he was out of range . '' <EOS>	96.13866483650742
<SOS> `` monsieur de chavigny where was he ? '' <EOS>	69.42097667409841
<SOS> `` absent . '' <EOS>	90.47749000074067
<SOS> `` and la ramee ? '' <EOS>	77.14830385927206
<SOS> `` was found locked up in the prisoner 's room , a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him . '' <EOS>	61.48873120330048
<SOS> `` but the man who was under him ? '' <EOS>	52.10217472080185
<SOS> `` was an accomplice of the duke 's and escaped along with him . '' <EOS>	99.02948494972368
<SOS> mazarin groaned . <EOS>	96.36980991373034
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , advancing toward the cardinal , `` it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time . <EOS>	47.07029289035769
<SOS> it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner . <EOS>	65.35362000428177
<SOS> france is large ; the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant . '' <EOS>	60.98462952207246
<SOS> `` and who is to pursue him ? '' <EOS>	65.49711090267292
<SOS> cried mazarin . <EOS>	61.47649322840411
<SOS> `` i , pardieu ! '' <EOS>	59.233978039876064
<SOS> `` and you would arrest him ? '' <EOS>	98.70453640183518
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	57.65965772413615
<SOS> `` you would arrest the duc de beaufort , armed , in the field ? '' <EOS>	63.10681946385221
<SOS> `` if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil , i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in . '' <EOS>	68.6366859142748
<SOS> `` so would i , '' said porthos . <EOS>	53.48771471082121
<SOS> `` so would you ! '' <EOS>	94.049062323016
<SOS> said mazarin , looking with astonishment at those two men . <EOS>	52.89966664910369
<SOS> `` but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle . '' <EOS>	71.07269583271191
<SOS> `` very well , '' said d'artagnan , his eyes aflame , `` battle ! <EOS>	72.72591981174956
<SOS> it is a long time since we have had a battle , eh , porthos ? '' <EOS>	96.40443623482744
<SOS> `` battle ! '' <EOS>	65.13214377584815
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	91.32223559850652
<SOS> `` and you think you can catch him ? '' <EOS>	86.73590599908601
<SOS> `` yes , if we are better mounted than he . '' <EOS>	71.301021394107
<SOS> `` go then , take what guards you find here , and pursue him . '' <EOS>	52.6287056058107
<SOS> `` you command us , my lord , to do so ? '' <EOS>	63.21575216826126
<SOS> `` and i sign my orders , '' said mazarin , taking a piece of paper and writing some lines ; `` monsieur du vallon , your barony is on the back of the duc de beaufort 's horse ; you have nothing to do but to overtake it . <EOS>	42.54264641198373
<SOS> as for you , my dear lieutenant , i promise you nothing ; but if you bring him back to me , dead or alive , you may ask all you wish . '' <EOS>	53.24352200969887
<SOS> `` to horse , porthos ! '' <EOS>	54.82300242591731
<SOS> said d'artagnan , taking his friend by the hand . <EOS>	95.27180615544438
<SOS> `` here i am , '' smiled porthos , with his sublime composure . <EOS>	81.1198455784784
<SOS> they descended the great staircase , taking with them all the guards they found on their road , and crying out , `` to arms ! <EOS>	69.50359662298202
<SOS> to arms ! '' <EOS>	62.98372020001212
<SOS> and immediately put spur to horse , which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind . <EOS>	67.98990177139059
<SOS> `` well , baron , i promise you some good exercise ! '' <EOS>	65.58856013757523
<SOS> said the gascon . <EOS>	72.79250542299394
<SOS> `` yes , my captain . '' <EOS>	85.34023744903004
<SOS> as they went , the citizens , awakened , left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers , barking . <EOS>	59.95466814600217
<SOS> at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean , d'artagnan upset a man ; it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on . <EOS>	89.9654304357999
<SOS> the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings . <EOS>	52.61388958307712
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	109.18911855024703
<SOS> there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy . <EOS>	62.62245344068433
<SOS> chapter xxv . <EOS>	39.665968058199994
<SOS> an adventure on the high road . <EOS>	53.19055751752504
<SOS> the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes , and soon found themselves out of the town , then in a forest and then within sight of a village . <EOS>	64.28736282464472
<SOS> the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step ; their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces . <EOS>	110.62791571861453
<SOS> d'artagnan , freely applying his spurs , was in advance of porthos two feet at the most ; mousqueton followed two lengths behind ; the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts . <EOS>	59.58852213758618
<SOS> from the top of an eminence d'artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat , in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur . <EOS>	86.03305050471505
<SOS> he rode on , convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive . <EOS>	64.34223336716147
<SOS> in five minutes he had arrived at the place , where the guards joined him , coming up one by one . <EOS>	60.373929152314965
<SOS> the several members of that group were much excited . <EOS>	43.5613696727261
<SOS> they looked at the cord , still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground . <EOS>	75.68274855933308
<SOS> their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures . <EOS>	61.49731831533277
<SOS> on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air . <EOS>	63.73791920638409
<SOS> a few soldiers , commanded by a sergeant , drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse . <EOS>	69.87453664641745
<SOS> d'artagnan went straight to the sergeant . <EOS>	113.83191346252941
<SOS> `` my officer , '' said the sergeant , `` it is not permitted to stop here . '' <EOS>	72.47557903003641
<SOS> `` that prohibition is not for me , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.764225320895804
<SOS> `` have the fugitives been pursued ? '' <EOS>	96.56068500432045
<SOS> `` yes , my officer ; unfortunately , they are well mounted . '' <EOS>	52.09111540639336
<SOS> `` how many are there ? '' <EOS>	77.58565552402254
<SOS> `` four , and a fifth whom they carried away wounded . '' <EOS>	66.88221124081312
<SOS> `` four ! '' <EOS>	50.241652999424275
<SOS> said d'artagnan , looking at porthos . <EOS>	73.08311888657963
<SOS> `` do you hear , baron ? <EOS>	54.48733832871018
<SOS> they are only four ! '' <EOS>	67.39359586766203
<SOS> a joyous smile lighted porthos 's face . <EOS>	76.07882618546599
<SOS> `` how long a start have they ? '' <EOS>	81.48803299522974
<SOS> `` two hours and a quarter , my officer . '' <EOS>	82.66480970998275
<SOS> `` two hours and a quarter that is nothing ; we are well mounted , are we not , porthos ? '' <EOS>	108.01577692051731
<SOS> porthos breathed a sigh ; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses . <EOS>	66.5039949060423
<SOS> `` very good , '' said d'artagnan ; `` and now in what direction did they set out ? '' <EOS>	75.78230955379331
<SOS> `` that i am forbidden to tell . '' <EOS>	112.57065059999556
<SOS> d'artagnan drew from his pocket a paper . <EOS>	95.57868767525474
<SOS> `` order of the king , '' he said . <EOS>	81.71564734625372
<SOS> `` speak to the governor , then . '' <EOS>	103.31794903182221
<SOS> `` and where is the governor ? '' <EOS>	82.48038817058031
<SOS> `` in the country . '' <EOS>	56.940333277392206
<SOS> anger mounted to d'artagnan 's face ; he frowned and his cheeks were colored . <EOS>	108.5131168893982
<SOS> `` ah , you scoundrel ! '' <EOS>	87.82327426651759
<SOS> he said to the sergeant , `` i believe you are impudent to me ! <EOS>	60.04599866796855
<SOS> wait ! '' <EOS>	71.02858401438705
<SOS> he unfolded the paper , presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it . <EOS>	50.43773743687185
<SOS> `` order of the king , i tell you . <EOS>	76.39279592667705
<SOS> read and answer , or i will blow out your brains ! '' <EOS>	96.71987081477867
<SOS> the sergeant saw that d'artagnan was in earnest . <EOS>	72.58707619797825
<SOS> `` the vendomois road , '' he replied . <EOS>	92.0693073930397
<SOS> `` and by what gate did they go out ? '' <EOS>	78.51729827352045
<SOS> `` by the saint maur gate . '' <EOS>	103.34678494631878
<SOS> `` if you are deceiving me , rascal , you will be hanged to morrow . '' <EOS>	63.5020326126975
<SOS> `` and if you catch up with them you wo n't come back to hang me , '' murmured the sergeant . <EOS>	51.45377841470044
<SOS> d'artagnan shrugged his shoulders , made a sign to his escort and started . <EOS>	93.40403886079199
<SOS> `` this way , gentlemen , this way ! '' <EOS>	101.82038127276475
<SOS> he cried , directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out . <EOS>	114.66613729440218
<SOS> but , now that the duke had escaped , the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock . <EOS>	53.87223519015789
<SOS> it was necessary to compel him to open it , as the sergeant had been compelled to speak , and this took another ten minutes . <EOS>	101.81925084005006
<SOS> this last obstacle having been overcome , the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor ; but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace ; three of them stopped after an hour 's gallop , and one fell down . <EOS>	50.837862667612384
<SOS> d'artagnan , who never turned his head , did not perceive it . <EOS>	55.00223942345731
<SOS> porthos told him of it in his calm manner . <EOS>	57.97831244583451
<SOS> `` if only we two arrive , '' said d'artagnan , `` it will be enough , since the duke 's troop are only four in number . '' <EOS>	98.46606649621043
<SOS> `` that is true , '' said porthos and he spurred his courser on . <EOS>	87.53854181664802
<SOS> at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping ; their legs began to tremble , and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters . <EOS>	68.7940017112612
<SOS> `` let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time , '' said porthos . <EOS>	76.76874013063622
<SOS> `` let us rather kill them ! <EOS>	69.76566799145527
<SOS> yes , kill them ! '' <EOS>	64.73804360763043
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` i see fresh tracks ; 't is not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place . '' <EOS>	88.27872377644657
<SOS> in fact , the road was trodden by horses ' feet , visible even in the approaching gloom of evening . <EOS>	68.06760411099783
<SOS> they set out ; after a run of two leagues , mousqueton 's horse sank . <EOS>	64.93057053618462
<SOS> `` gracious me ! '' <EOS>	94.38657375035322
<SOS> said porthos , `` there 's phoebus ruined . '' <EOS>	80.24929981351787
<SOS> `` the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles . '' <EOS>	79.40125667889703
<SOS> `` i 'm above that . '' <EOS>	54.66228839790013
<SOS> `` let us set out again , at full gallop . '' <EOS>	74.7095594733917
<SOS> `` yes , if we can . '' <EOS>	57.113244276615184
<SOS> but at last the lieutenant 's horse refused to go on ; he could not breathe ; one last spur , instead of making him advance , made him fall . <EOS>	70.76537502811816
<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	72.41476975765677
<SOS> exclaimed porthos ; `` there 's vulcan foundered . '' <EOS>	69.73734165568372
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	45.64406607142405
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` then we must stop ! <EOS>	75.6452436302472
<SOS> give me your horse , porthos . <EOS>	69.35150338377417
<SOS> what the devil are you doing ? '' <EOS>	69.115159080023
<SOS> `` by jove , i am falling , or rather , bayard is falling , '' answered porthos . <EOS>	82.47631951726432
<SOS> all three then cried : `` all 's over . '' <EOS>	111.09906590731894
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	95.7868061186595
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	49.294221713215435
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	59.40828582064542
<SOS> `` i hear a horse . '' <EOS>	116.10645350593632
<SOS> `` it belongs to one of our companions , who is overtaking us . '' <EOS>	95.85009617372069
<SOS> `` no , '' said d'artagnan , `` it is in advance . '' <EOS>	74.16638686669273
<SOS> `` that is another thing , '' said porthos ; and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d'artagnan . <EOS>	65.87228537502101
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said mousqueton , who , abandoning his horse on the high road , had come on foot to rejoin his master , `` phoebus could no longer hold out and `` `` silence ! '' <EOS>	85.36466443820065
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	59.689623308262114
<SOS> in fact , at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind . <EOS>	115.1829504615522
<SOS> `` it is five hundred feet from here , in advance , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	83.13325345541259
<SOS> `` true , monsieur , '' said mousqueton ; `` and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting house . '' <EOS>	111.20234722670196
<SOS> `` mousqueton , thy pistols , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	56.08205057652979
<SOS> `` i have them at hand , monsieur . '' <EOS>	73.82223495833138
<SOS> `` porthos , take yours from your holsters . '' <EOS>	78.30270241289224
<SOS> `` i have them . '' <EOS>	94.46431071249387
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	82.74698569139522
<SOS> said d'artagnan , seizing his own ; `` now you understand , porthos ? '' <EOS>	56.38794562928439
<SOS> `` not too well . '' <EOS>	63.41073245483262
<SOS> `` we are out on the king 's service . '' <EOS>	50.38526285441259
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	51.11642806096288
<SOS> `` for the king 's service we need horses . '' <EOS>	92.70899778818489
<SOS> `` that is true , '' said porthos . <EOS>	57.807059617053994
<SOS> `` then not a word , but set to work ! '' <EOS>	52.46773285477812
<SOS> they went on through the darkness , silent as phantoms ; they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees . <EOS>	71.26548014395316
<SOS> `` yonder is the house , porthos , '' said the gascon ; `` let me do what i please and do you what i do . '' <EOS>	96.73022552879945
<SOS> they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut , four fine horses . <EOS>	54.67624128519272
<SOS> a groom was rubbing them down ; near them were saddles and bridles . <EOS>	59.264368497514475
<SOS> d'artagnan approached quickly , making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind . <EOS>	97.71713387690775
<SOS> `` i buy those horses , '' he said to the groom . <EOS>	57.67328707339926
<SOS> the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise , but made no reply . <EOS>	80.32254596743583
<SOS> `` did n't you hear , fellow ? '' <EOS>	58.23570023873683
<SOS> `` yes , i heard . '' <EOS>	77.94586571356282
<SOS> `` why , then , did n't you reply ? '' <EOS>	99.56745247672768
<SOS> `` because these horses are not to be sold , '' was the reply . <EOS>	80.96131134149289
<SOS> `` i take them , then , '' said the lieutenant . <EOS>	62.80914709258257
<SOS> and he took hold of one within his reach ; his two companions did the same thing . <EOS>	90.9208397604517
<SOS> `` sir , '' cried the groom , `` they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour . '' <EOS>	81.24158431543104
<SOS> `` half an hour 's rest is enough , '' replied the gascon . <EOS>	100.65518830452312
<SOS> the groom cried aloud for help . <EOS>	89.37800541130026
<SOS> a kind of steward appeared , just as d'artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount . <EOS>	58.850743778642986
<SOS> the steward attempted to expostulate . <EOS>	104.21483471255469
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' cried the lieutenant , `` if you say a word i will blow out your brains . '' <EOS>	65.01947919564559
<SOS> `` but , sir , '' answered the steward , `` do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon ? '' <EOS>	88.08197494550501
<SOS> `` so much the better ; they must be good animals , then . '' <EOS>	90.87533561312425
<SOS> `` sir , i shall call my people . '' <EOS>	78.7879496744533
<SOS> `` and i , mine ; i 've ten guards behind me , do n't you hear them gallop ? <EOS>	88.56000658455184

<SOS> come , porthos ; come , mousqueton . '' <EOS>	75.00866325282237
<SOS> they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible . <EOS>	81.27733034905553
<SOS> `` halloo ! <EOS>	77.15784577414856
<SOS> hi ! <EOS>	73.64695623943454

<SOS> cried the steward ; `` the house servants , with the carbines ! '' <EOS>	46.518078337198034
<SOS> `` on ! <EOS>	78.68727236894881

<SOS> they all set off , swift as the wind . <EOS>	71.35989441332252
<SOS> `` here ! '' <EOS>	82.45265570494567
<SOS> cried the steward , `` here ! '' <EOS>	69.52935332020064
<SOS> whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building . <EOS>	59.893866948325346
<SOS> `` take care of your horses ! '' <EOS>	60.686162572291025
<SOS> cried d'artagnan to him . <EOS>	86.56451516637162
<SOS> `` fire ! '' <EOS>	46.765684479191144
<SOS> replied the steward . <EOS>	60.88422907021357
<SOS> a gleam , like a flash of lightning , illumined the road , and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls , which were fired wildly in the air . <EOS>	64.63189378528648
<SOS> `` they fire like grooms , '' said porthos . <EOS>	50.53989312803032
<SOS> `` in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that , do you remember the road to crevecoeur , mousqueton ? '' <EOS>	96.51568356667275
<SOS> `` ah , sir ! <EOS>	78.82030536450034

<SOS> `` egad , did n't you hear ? <EOS>	77.2587355503404

<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	115.15801497098124

<SOS> `` exactly so . '' <EOS>	102.73524213448567
<SOS> `` and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left ? '' <EOS>	81.16928437566983
<SOS> `` my dear porthos , you are really a man of most superior understanding , '' said d'artagnan , with a look as if he spoke against his conviction . <EOS>	74.11505565034126
<SOS> `` pooh ! '' <EOS>	99.94414149238185
<SOS> replied porthos , `` i am what i am . '' <EOS>	86.72492640434108
<SOS> they rode on for an hour , till the horses were covered with foam and dust . <EOS>	61.03021187910802
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	52.18998687009913

<SOS> `` i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen , '' exclaimed porthos , leaning over his horse 's mane . <EOS>	43.867669697467626
<SOS> `` impossible . '' <EOS>	81.28651858237045

<SOS> `` nonsense ! '' <EOS>	102.02426775346858
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` they 'll suppose us to be stronger than themselves , as we 're in pursuit ; they 'll be afraid and will disperse . '' <EOS>	55.47594076554272
<SOS> `` certainly , '' remarked porthos . <EOS>	78.12732816987196
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	78.2991453510207

<SOS> cried d'artagnan , in his stentorian voice ; `` we shall laugh over all this in five minutes . '' <EOS>	46.9978248554042
<SOS> and they darted on anew . <EOS>	60.80517811017966
<SOS> the horses , excited by pain and emulation , raced over the dark road , in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass , denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon . <EOS>	77.25922461047378
<SOS> chapter xxvi . <EOS>	99.88729477681464
<SOS> the rencontre . <EOS>	47.053381642211775
<SOS> they rode on in this way for ten minutes . <EOS>	59.5308641165787
<SOS> suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass , advanced , grew in size , and as they loomed up larger and larger , assumed the appearance of two horsemen . <EOS>	50.30073726092041
<SOS> `` aha ! '' <EOS>	76.84741421096894
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` they 're coming toward us . '' <EOS>	63.20381178643918
<SOS> `` so much the worse for them , '' said porthos . <EOS>	95.18894186557006
<SOS> `` who goes there ? '' <EOS>	73.09141585464528
<SOS> cried a hoarse voice . <EOS>	56.19423803374836
<SOS> the three horsemen made no reply , stopped not , and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed . <EOS>	81.57549309728294
<SOS> `` bridle in mouth ! '' <EOS>	84.56278066086969
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	49.85419179283894
<SOS> porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn . <EOS>	69.52425342901914
<SOS> `` who goes there ? '' <EOS>	91.38003609656263
<SOS> was asked a second time . <EOS>	85.22414653793994
<SOS> `` not a step forward , or you 're dead men . '' <EOS>	76.1895977009604
<SOS> `` stuff ! '' <EOS>	80.39490558216806
<SOS> cried porthos , almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit . <EOS>	69.89434505209911
<SOS> `` stuff and nonsense ; we have seen plenty of dead men in our time . '' <EOS>	67.8083131601616
<SOS> hearing these words , the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms . <EOS>	71.50758269313943
<SOS> `` back ! '' <EOS>	64.95645354272543
<SOS> shouted d'artagnan , `` or you are dead ! '' <EOS>	111.14875131652
<SOS> two shots were the reply to this threat ; but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them ; a third pistol shot was heard , aimed by d'artagnan , and one of his adversaries fell . <EOS>	61.09661090437089
<SOS> as for porthos , he assaulted the foe with such violence that , although his sword was thrust aside , the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it . <EOS>	47.22836728375226
<SOS> `` finish , mouston , finish the work ! '' <EOS>	53.967085311150406
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	75.08656574675592
<SOS> and he darted on beside his friend , who had already begun a fresh pursuit . <EOS>	83.1738455993291
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	41.565014525283026
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	54.90761422920953
<SOS> `` i 've broken my man 's skull , '' cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	90.12483586403474
<SOS> `` and you `` `` i 've only thrown the fellow down , but hark ! '' <EOS>	72.23024644518783
<SOS> another shot of a carbine was heard . <EOS>	66.98006611957175
<SOS> it was mousqueton , who was obeying his master 's command . <EOS>	81.6472585881243
<SOS> `` on ! <EOS>	76.44508122626073
<SOS> on ! '' <EOS>	88.83447189653357
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` all goes well ! <EOS>	91.43163344085023
<SOS> we have the first throw . '' <EOS>	96.89976721957282
<SOS> `` ha ! <EOS>	87.46035364759855
<SOS> ha ! '' <EOS>	82.90916230240317
<SOS> answered porthos , `` behold , other players appear . '' <EOS>	66.24578864667399
<SOS> and in fact , two other cavaliers made their appearance , detached , as it seemed , from the principal group ; they again disputed the road . <EOS>	93.44757537275153
<SOS> this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak . <EOS>	62.09557429193755
<SOS> `` stand aside ! '' <EOS>	45.52908590708825
<SOS> he cried ; `` stand off the road ! '' <EOS>	59.20153299081335
<SOS> `` what do you want ? '' <EOS>	80.68417742381814
<SOS> asked a voice . <EOS>	58.930023881669854
<SOS> `` the duke ! '' <EOS>	71.17727052806129
<SOS> porthos and d'artagnan roared out both at once . <EOS>	56.33604099246321
<SOS> a burst of laughter was the answer , but finished with a groan . <EOS>	71.3979909963997
<SOS> d'artagnan had , with his sword , cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed . <EOS>	69.6614155400838
<SOS> at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d'artagnan turned to him . <EOS>	79.714964255653
<SOS> `` bravo ! <EOS>	54.69485872350141
<SOS> you 've killed him , i think . '' <EOS>	43.171020027337896
<SOS> `` no , wounded his horse only . '' <EOS>	50.04775883903192
<SOS> `` what would you have , my dear fellow ? <EOS>	72.60834382578385
<SOS> one does n't hit the bull 's eye every time ; it is something to hit inside the ring . <EOS>	107.59438238427053
<SOS> ho ! <EOS>	53.92735175510481
<SOS> parbleau ! <EOS>	80.78417016741707
<SOS> what is the matter with my horse ? '' <EOS>	87.4917825207174
<SOS> `` your horse is falling , '' said porthos , reining in his own . <EOS>	97.67464588345511
<SOS> in truth , the lieutenant 's horse stumbled and fell on his knees ; then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die . <EOS>	68.39022692280116
<SOS> he had received in the chest the bullet of d'artagnan 's first adversary . <EOS>	68.10949611521674
<SOS> d'artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies . <EOS>	81.41712745608035
<SOS> `` does your honor want a horse ? '' <EOS>	57.44951120295842
<SOS> asked mousqueton . <EOS>	91.13615008418549
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	74.59022902442332
<SOS> want one ! '' <EOS>	87.59305427378236
<SOS> cried the gascon . <EOS>	101.43501481299705
<SOS> `` here 's one , your honor `` `` how the devil hast thou two horses ? '' <EOS>	48.608445174155456
<SOS> asked d'artagnan , jumping on one of them . <EOS>	55.41408875808287
<SOS> `` their masters are dead ! <EOS>	42.496831668251794
<SOS> i thought they might be useful , so i took them . '' <EOS>	61.88320084550736
<SOS> meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols . <EOS>	53.01885663357959
<SOS> `` be on the qui vive ! '' <EOS>	73.94661975339615
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	96.24103377442775
<SOS> `` here are two other cavaliers . '' <EOS>	61.605293722339816
<SOS> as he spoke , two horsemen advanced at full speed . <EOS>	63.18088131504087
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	84.8218754247698
<SOS> your honor ! '' <EOS>	59.40783207486083
<SOS> cried mousqueton , `` the man you upset is getting up . '' <EOS>	47.17373923623571
<SOS> `` why did n't thou do as thou didst to the first man ? '' <EOS>	110.93996574673764
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	55.41224062124149
<SOS> `` i held the horses , my hands were full , your honor . '' <EOS>	69.59549716020582
<SOS> a shot was fired that moment ; mousqueton shrieked with pain . <EOS>	77.99227868839779
<SOS> `` ah , sir ! <EOS>	62.3135921892193
<SOS> i 'm hit in the other side ! <EOS>	80.21059092808792
<SOS> exactly opposite the other ! <EOS>	77.56958770249175
<SOS> this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens . '' <EOS>	78.09345871657973
<SOS> porthos turned around like a lion , plunged on the dismounted cavalier , who tried to draw his sword ; but before it was out of the scabbard , porthos , with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher 's knife . <EOS>	86.2999831151653
<SOS> mousqueton , groaning , slipped from his horse , his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle . <EOS>	73.17955581460717
<SOS> on perceiving the cavaliers , d'artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh ; besides , his horse , he found , had a carbine on the bow of the saddle . <EOS>	57.5647528407902
<SOS> `` here i am ! '' <EOS>	102.8343334636619
<SOS> exclaimed porthos . <EOS>	72.34945462852554
<SOS> `` shall we wait , or shall we charge ? '' <EOS>	69.47903388510217
<SOS> `` let us charge them , '' answered the gascon . <EOS>	74.16553588355997
<SOS> `` charge ! '' <EOS>	86.55964077025192
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	63.62153611431562
<SOS> they spurred on their horses ; the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them . <EOS>	38.59115712350496
<SOS> `` for the king ! '' <EOS>	77.2212673396131
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	54.849783324486026
<SOS> `` the king has no authority here ! '' <EOS>	91.30962739857868
<SOS> answered a deep voice , which seemed to proceed from a cloud , so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust . <EOS>	61.00365444407411
<SOS> `` 't is well , we will see if the king 's name is not a passport everywhere , '' replied the gascon . <EOS>	64.15351510180874
<SOS> `` see ! '' <EOS>	61.336148836677275
<SOS> answered the voice . <EOS>	84.28922250803197
<SOS> two shots were fired at once , one by d'artagnan , the other by the adversary of porthos . <EOS>	47.867546190612025
<SOS> d'artagnan 's ball took off his enemy 's hat . <EOS>	49.300151020412315
<SOS> the ball fired by porthos 's foe went through the throat of his horse , which fell , groaning . <EOS>	60.402248368417204
<SOS> `` for the last time , where are you going ? '' <EOS>	75.50841345422403
<SOS> `` to the devil ! '' <EOS>	47.1390432787727
<SOS> answered d'artagnan . <EOS>	65.0798662313141
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	89.22996393021522
<SOS> you may be easy , then you 'll get there . '' <EOS>	78.69282220352828
<SOS> d'artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him ; he had no time to draw from his holsters . <EOS>	87.44557784978251
<SOS> he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him , and made his horse rear . <EOS>	84.92576942580946
<SOS> the ball struck the animal full in front . <EOS>	71.80062604095069
<SOS> d'artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side . <EOS>	107.89555640168817
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	87.28451651466983
<SOS> this , '' cried the voice , the tone of which was at once polished and jeering , `` this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men . <EOS>	75.69032085288606
<SOS> to the sword , sir ! <EOS>	46.40226589501767
<SOS> the sword ! '' <EOS>	95.29811236450519
<SOS> and he jumped off his horse . <EOS>	86.26495847768392
<SOS> `` to the swords ! <EOS>	80.4632997781973
<SOS> be it so ! '' <EOS>	76.66449117489616
<SOS> replied d'artagnan ; `` that is exactly what i want . '' <EOS>	70.19279477919562
<SOS> d'artagnan , in two steps , was engaged with the foe , whom , according to custom , he attacked impetuously , but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause . <EOS>	61.380668275130915
<SOS> twice he was obliged to step back ; his opponent stirred not one inch . <EOS>	81.79337391608654
<SOS> d'artagnan returned and again attacked him . <EOS>	72.99310560127537
<SOS> twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides , without effect ; sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth . <EOS>	82.55466286466023
<SOS> at last d'artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing . <EOS>	83.79198788836018
<SOS> he brought it to bear , skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning , and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible . <EOS>	85.06191695876025
<SOS> the blow was parried . <EOS>	44.93673204171226
<SOS> `` 'sdeath ! '' <EOS>	77.50054729743141
<SOS> he cried , with his gascon accent . <EOS>	95.09028997412886
<SOS> at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and , bending his bare head , tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant . <EOS>	72.72680597354552
<SOS> as to d'artagnan , afraid of some feint , he still stood on the defensive . <EOS>	65.0042008699481
<SOS> `` have a care , '' cried porthos to his opponent ; `` i 've still two pistols charged . '' <EOS>	70.70663624482117
<SOS> `` the more reason you should fire the first ! '' <EOS>	63.285554527444
<SOS> cried his foe . <EOS>	76.38788265709243
<SOS> porthos fired ; the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle . <EOS>	73.84286791845888
<SOS> as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants . <EOS>	90.05736763699932
<SOS> `` athos ! '' <EOS>	51.06587166374823
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan . <EOS>	49.09909184872723
<SOS> `` d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	68.56971224218783
<SOS> ejaculated athos . <EOS>	59.569030801794106
<SOS> athos raised his sword ; d'artagnan lowered his . <EOS>	83.2597194645917
<SOS> `` aramis ! '' <EOS>	84.73312362265916
<SOS> cried athos , `` do n't fire ! '' <EOS>	68.82763268247692
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	74.88937307491481
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>	46.892278285058126
<SOS> is it you , aramis ? '' <EOS>	59.45182256035403
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	65.36011557965374
<SOS> and he threw away his pistol . <EOS>	70.37161411645529
<SOS> aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword . <EOS>	64.54809487679988
<SOS> `` my son ! '' <EOS>	72.674666524143
<SOS> exclaimed athos , extending his hand to d'artagnan . <EOS>	78.76083836559575
<SOS> this was the name which he gave him in former days , in their moments of tender intimacy . <EOS>	79.24632055113918
<SOS> `` athos ! '' <EOS>	114.6435944656319
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , wringing his hands . <EOS>	78.55058327231626
<SOS> `` so you defend him ! <EOS>	54.16990361698365
<SOS> and i , who have sworn to take him dead or alive , i am dishonored and by you ! '' <EOS>	55.5599397627127
<SOS> `` kill me ! '' <EOS>	80.17581445291863
<SOS> replied athos , uncovering his breast , `` if your honor requires my death . '' <EOS>	89.68276094586959
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	78.21153752054272
<SOS> woe is me ! <EOS>	73.33123019110545
<SOS> woe is me ! '' <EOS>	103.16706595692575
<SOS> cried the lieutenant ; `` there 's only one man in the world who could stay my hand ; by a fatality that very man bars my way . <EOS>	90.61334987376823
<SOS> what shall i say to the cardinal ? '' <EOS>	77.75027748183123
<SOS> `` you can tell him , sir , '' answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field , `` that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men ; of fighting man to man , without discomfiture , against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d'herblay , and of surrendering only to fifty men ! <EOS>	89.86372294575094
<SOS> `` the prince ! '' <EOS>	81.27360013663204
<SOS> exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis , unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort , whilst d'artagnan and porthos stepped backward . <EOS>	108.63349381483701
<SOS> `` fifty cavaliers ! '' <EOS>	94.36263817994991
<SOS> cried the gascon and porthos . <EOS>	77.18987748786651
<SOS> `` look around you , gentlemen , if you doubt the fact , '' said the duke . <EOS>	65.47204913386462
<SOS> the two friends looked to the right , to the left ; they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen . <EOS>	52.06937756278156
<SOS> `` hearing the noise of the fight , '' resumed the duke , `` i fancied you had about twenty men with you , so i came back with those around me , tired of always running away , and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause ; but you are only two . '' <EOS>	59.24238038501113
<SOS> `` yes , my lord ; but , as you have said , two that are a match for twenty , '' said athos . <EOS>	70.43146324743537
<SOS> `` come , gentlemen , your swords , '' said the duke . <EOS>	94.18360034191782
<SOS> `` our swords ! '' <EOS>	86.13984895305232
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , raising his head and regaining his self possession . <EOS>	105.50683502214703
<SOS> `` never ! '' <EOS>	84.13022979787381
<SOS> `` never ! '' <EOS>	97.33964922814788
<SOS> added porthos . <EOS>	87.69680287404705
<SOS> some of the men moved toward them . <EOS>	67.78906723693088
<SOS> `` one moment , my lord , '' whispered athos , and he said something in a low voice . <EOS>	61.82966379929972
<SOS> `` as you will , '' replied the duke . <EOS>	68.73446659383555
<SOS> `` i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request . <EOS>	59.11209672514412
<SOS> gentlemen , '' he said to his escort , `` withdraw . <EOS>	94.95232644165606
<SOS> monsieur d'artagnan , monsieur du vallon , you are free . '' <EOS>	94.25168210031151
<SOS> the order was obeyed ; d'artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle . <EOS>	115.92242916544804
<SOS> `` now , d'herblay , '' said athos , `` dismount and come here . '' <EOS>	85.95386837403701
<SOS> aramis dismounted and went to porthos , whilst athos approached d'artagnan . <EOS>	72.8340932895886
<SOS> all four once more together . <EOS>	100.43861707415446
<SOS> `` friends ! '' <EOS>	50.96280914485037

<SOS> `` no , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` i regret to see that we , hitherto united , are opposed to each other . <EOS>	71.68627619517471

<SOS> `` well , be on our side now , '' resumed aramis . <EOS>	70.24813733798466
<SOS> `` silence , d'herblay ! '' <EOS>	90.41650165753845
<SOS> cried athos ; `` such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these . <EOS>	57.42634140347162

<SOS> `` meantime , here we are , enemies ! '' <EOS>	60.583954665104365

<SOS> `` gramercy ! <EOS>	93.97947704304356
<SOS> who would ever have thought it ? '' <EOS>	47.213626413608
<SOS> d'artagnan only sighed . <EOS>	70.9279888871845
<SOS> athos looked at them both and took their hands in his . <EOS>	78.53652958340852
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , `` this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through . <EOS>	52.7571552456373
<SOS> yes , we are severed ; there is the great , the distressing truth ! <EOS>	80.0729960789158
<SOS> but we have not as yet declared war ; perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions , therefore a solemn conference is indispensable . '' <EOS>	55.10990100516138
<SOS> `` for my own part , i demand it , '' said aramis . <EOS>	78.41122973584103
<SOS> `` i accept it , '' interposed d'artagnan , proudly . <EOS>	109.90932115668514
<SOS> porthos bowed , as if in assent . <EOS>	43.37126706446604
<SOS> `` let us choose a place of rendezvous , '' continued athos , `` and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other . '' <EOS>	94.15534302637397
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	74.64622160583654
<SOS> the other three exclaimed . <EOS>	81.61067154314034
<SOS> `` well , then , the place ? '' <EOS>	54.90247091231206
<SOS> `` will the place royale suit you ? '' <EOS>	64.13610324900817

<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	52.5170850115768

<SOS> `` the place royale be it so ! '' <EOS>	50.21640771615964

<SOS> `` and we , porthos , '' said d'artagnan , `` will return , carrying our shame to the cardinal . '' <EOS>	71.58190453966498
<SOS> `` and tell him , '' cried a voice , `` that i am not too old yet for a man of action . '' <EOS>	85.3641673586937
<SOS> d'artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort . <EOS>	88.23117172149361
<SOS> `` can i do anything for you , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	59.193541396624056
<SOS> asked the duke . <EOS>	88.82116501552662
<SOS> `` bear witness that we have done all that we could . '' <EOS>	93.1096083025183

<SOS> the duke , as he spoke , kissed his hand , spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared , followed by his troop , who were soon lost in distance and darkness . <EOS>	53.526844335666446
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses ; they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him . <EOS>	92.877726548425
<SOS> `` what do i see ? '' <EOS>	41.281638434593056

<SOS> `` grimaud , is it thou ? '' <EOS>	44.38745314643586
<SOS> grimaud signified that he was not mistaken . <EOS>	68.79489884789994

<SOS> `` who has given them to us ? '' <EOS>	89.27903881644555

<SOS> `` to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders , your honor . '' <EOS>	61.18551788559399
<SOS> they were taking the road toward paris , when groans , which seemed to proceed from a ditch , attracted their attention . <EOS>	58.57504027804151
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	101.04635777847601
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.99729678421212
<SOS> `` it is i mousqueton , '' said a mournful voice , whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road . <EOS>	99.73181037312457
<SOS> porthos ran to him . <EOS>	54.61969896815052
<SOS> `` art thou dangerously wounded , my dear mousqueton ? '' <EOS>	81.29714680069671

<SOS> `` i will take care of mousqueton , '' said grimaud ; and he gave his arm to his old comrade , whose eyes were full of tears , nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again . <EOS>	72.29478943241088
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos went on , meantime , to paris . <EOS>	85.94745728217708
<SOS> they were passed by a sort of courier , covered with dust , the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal , giving testimony to the valor of d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	70.80044142793876
<SOS> mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him , announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him . <EOS>	58.95552561979421
<SOS> `` what consoles me , '' said the cardinal after reading the letter , `` is that , at least , in this chase , d'artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel . <EOS>	77.46376103580947

<SOS> `` ' i am a gascon , ' said i , 'only when i succeed . ' <EOS>	74.55223210026021
<SOS> the answer pleased him and he laughed . <EOS>	102.15546992322004
<SOS> `` 'that will teach me , ' he said , 'to have my guards provided with better horses ; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend , you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive .

<SOS> he continued : `` so i was going away , but he called me back . <EOS>	103.1958496226654

<SOS> `` you understand , then , monsieur , '' resumed planchet , `` that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine `` `` no , do n't be alarmed ; but where did you get all these details ? '' <EOS>	84.17188564927409
<SOS> `` from a good source , sir ; i heard it from friquet . '' <EOS>	44.8630814344963
<SOS> `` from friquet ? <EOS>	56.39953487875529

<SOS> `` is he not a singing boy at notre dame ? '' <EOS>	65.69310255991219
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	57.92956236710757
<SOS> `` yes , that is the very boy ; he 's patronized by bazin . '' <EOS>	75.80308418265571
<SOS> `` ah , yes , i know . '' <EOS>	64.81276444062641
<SOS> `` of what importance is this little reptile to you ? '' <EOS>	105.02423696419379
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	63.22277926334501
<SOS> `` gad ! '' <EOS>	84.04816558508458
<SOS> replied d'artagnan ; `` he has already given me good information and he may do the same again . '' <EOS>	63.62629262912782
<SOS> whilst all this was going on , athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st. antoine . <EOS>	59.95362875617973
<SOS> they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on , that they might not fail at the appointed place . <EOS>	97.4338964569019
<SOS> bazin was their only attendant , for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton . <EOS>	67.3429166366752
<SOS> as they were passing onward , athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume , and assume a dress more suited to the city . <EOS>	64.95280730437055
<SOS> `` oh , no , dear count ! '' <EOS>	51.305853810093154
<SOS> cried aramis , `` is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to ? '' <EOS>	117.06391182894883
<SOS> `` what do you mean , aramis ? '' <EOS>	110.44792696490407
<SOS> `` that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois , and nothing else . '' <EOS>	56.15302917483062

<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	58.22691595827546

<SOS> `` who can say whether d'artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal ? <EOS>	54.601218805374984

<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	89.01343587185895
<SOS> aramis , you think that d'artagnan , that porthos , would lend their hands to such an infamy ? '' <EOS>	78.67945941970677
<SOS> `` among friends , my dear athos , no , you are right ; but among enemies it would be only a stratagem . '' <EOS>	55.339177278943055
<SOS> athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head . <EOS>	91.51152617000939
<SOS> `` what can you expect , athos ? <EOS>	104.06111821163603
<SOS> men are so made ; and we are not always twenty years old . <EOS>	63.40102964686536
<SOS> we have cruelly wounded , as you know , that personal pride by which d'artagnan is blindly governed . <EOS>	42.73456699583138
<SOS> he has been beaten . <EOS>	62.46759804817485
<SOS> did you not observe his despair on the journey ? <EOS>	94.55886517631573
<SOS> as to porthos , his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair . <EOS>	57.72167613716567
<SOS> well , he found us on his road and will not be baron this time . <EOS>	82.26100318659849
<SOS> perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening . <EOS>	58.28809503119137
<SOS> let us take our precautions , athos . '' <EOS>	47.92638767754369
<SOS> `` but suppose they come unarmed ? <EOS>	43.63804876331639

<SOS> `` oh , never fear ! <EOS>	85.73937305766988

<SOS> `` an excuse for us ! <EOS>	64.30853443746392

<SOS> to have to make a false excuse to porthos ! <EOS>	45.154614406851195
<SOS> oh , aramis ! '' <EOS>	66.90756629400889
<SOS> continued athos , shaking his head mournfully , `` upon my soul , you make me the most miserable of men ; you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship . <EOS>	76.37490676531719
<SOS> go in whatever guise you choose ; for my part , i shall go unarmed . '' <EOS>	62.0682570581902
<SOS> `` no , for i will not allow you to do so . <EOS>	47.087446157847836
<SOS> 't is not one man , not athos only , not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness , but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you . '' <EOS>	101.01435036618115
<SOS> `` be it so then , '' replied athos , sorrowfully . <EOS>	46.871056082467454
<SOS> and they pursued their road in mournful silence . <EOS>	44.65726351803963
<SOS> scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale , when they perceived three cavaliers , d'artagnan , porthos , and planchet , the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden , and planchet , his musket by his side . <EOS>	112.13193761240869
<SOS> they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine , and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade . <EOS>	84.13346360162213
<SOS> athos , therefore , commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner . <EOS>	54.063662058865404
<SOS> they then advanced two and two , and saluted each other politely . <EOS>	47.281422568620414
<SOS> `` now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference ? '' <EOS>	94.20475568393057
<SOS> inquired aramis , perceiving that people were stopping to look at them , supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians , and especially the inhabitants of the place royale . <EOS>	60.58197791804156
<SOS> `` the gate is shut , '' said aramis , `` but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees , and perfect seclusion , i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited . '' <EOS>	79.48840058401773
<SOS> d'artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place . <EOS>	81.42966953452137
<SOS> porthos ventured to put his head between the railings , to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom . <EOS>	114.5769909299211
<SOS> `` if you prefer any other place , '' said athos , in his persuasive voice , `` choose for yourselves . '' <EOS>	76.49718133297041
<SOS> `` this place , if monsieur d'herblay can procure the key , is the best that we can have , '' was the answer . <EOS>	84.3479820951383
<SOS> aramis went off at once , begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d'artagnan and porthos ; a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile . <EOS>	70.8451222995852
<SOS> aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan , who was saying to him : `` you swear , sir , that it is not so ? '' <EOS>	108.99677437423345
<SOS> `` stop , '' and aramis gave him a louis d'or . <EOS>	96.9448313040062
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	49.72351047161356
<SOS> you will not swear , my master , '' said the concierge , shaking his head . <EOS>	66.45273267677362
<SOS> `` well , one can never say what may happen ; at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends . '' <EOS>	69.2830857037241
<SOS> `` yes , certainly , '' added athos and the other two . <EOS>	51.65910068903614
<SOS> d'artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it . <EOS>	94.1865610869372
<SOS> `` you see ? '' <EOS>	61.53152361092855
<SOS> he said to porthos . <EOS>	65.0531409483102
<SOS> `` what do i see ? '' <EOS>	78.00686155085197
<SOS> `` that he would n't swear . '' <EOS>	87.26311970065413
<SOS> `` swear what ? '' <EOS>	81.22689419036618
<SOS> `` that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight . '' <EOS>	100.82635672415756
<SOS> `` and aramis would n't swear ? '' <EOS>	66.97352870567757
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	51.84919012589844
<SOS> `` attention , then ! '' <EOS>	92.57493949922696
<SOS> athos did not lose sight of the two speakers . <EOS>	65.64979947686187
<SOS> aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that d'artagnan and porthos might enter . <EOS>	59.059141564411995
<SOS> in passing through the gate , the hilt of the lieutenant 's sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak ; in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal . <EOS>	69.53382078372492
<SOS> `` do you see ? '' <EOS>	54.491123722689295
<SOS> whispered aramis to athos , touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt . <EOS>	80.6114514712739
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	61.234751510650966
<SOS> i do ! '' <EOS>	94.79958478790886
<SOS> replied athos , with a deep sigh . <EOS>	86.85445943036976
<SOS> he entered third , and aramis , who shut the gate after him , last . <EOS>	64.17392488112976
<SOS> the two serving men waited without ; but as if they likewise mistrusted each other , they kept their respective distances . <EOS>	86.53505434231825
<SOS> chapter xxviii . <EOS>	66.397359701958
<SOS> the place royale . <EOS>	72.85240712272068
<SOS> they proceeded silently to the centre of the place , but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud , they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees . <EOS>	73.09825628583805
<SOS> there were benches here and there ; the four gentlemen stopped near them ; at a sign from athos , porthos and d'artagnan sat down , the two others stood in front of them . <EOS>	101.13243040657457
<SOS> after a few minutes of silent embarrassment , athos spoke . <EOS>	62.900215722728106
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , `` our presence here is the best proof of former friendship ; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous ; not one has , therefore , to reproach himself . '' <EOS>	88.04624479747932
<SOS> `` hear me , count , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` instead of making compliments to each other , let us explain our conduct to each other , like men of right and honest hearts . '' <EOS>	82.48909546995215
<SOS> `` i wish for nothing more ; have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d'herblay ? <EOS>	53.83914201392465
<SOS> if so , speak out , '' answered athos . <EOS>	80.06386450210485
<SOS> `` i have , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	103.68997993454924
<SOS> `` when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne , i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood ; instead of answering me as a friend , you played with me as a child ; the friendship , therefore , that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords , but by your dissimulation at your castle . '' <EOS>	42.170091508514375
<SOS> `` d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	110.75919722816371
<SOS> said athos , reproachfully . <EOS>	53.27012748757805
<SOS> `` you asked for candor and you have it . <EOS>	95.91435217595
<SOS> you ask what i have against you ; i tell you . <EOS>	104.31041786080604
<SOS> and i have the same sincerity to show you , if you wish , monsieur d'herblay ; i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me . '' <EOS>	50.1953330339894
<SOS> `` really , monsieur , you say strange things , '' said aramis . <EOS>	67.93228156971651
<SOS> `` you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals , but did you make them ? <EOS>	103.43308923922547
<SOS> no , you sounded me , nothing more . <EOS>	76.80512202602063
<SOS> very well what did i say to you ? <EOS>	99.18103217897843
<SOS> that mazarin was contemptible and that i would n't serve mazarin . <EOS>	50.235796133254304
<SOS> but that is all . <EOS>	70.49940872405423
<SOS> did i tell you that i would n't serve any other ? <EOS>	40.49703612238855
<SOS> on the contrary , i gave you to understand , i think , that i adhered to the princes . <EOS>	71.85871321336413
<SOS> we even joked very pleasantly , if i remember rightly , on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest . <EOS>	83.41656894713863
<SOS> were you a party man ? <EOS>	82.68380608872913
<SOS> there is no doubt of that . <EOS>	55.12197315148961
<SOS> well , why should not we , too , belong to a party ? <EOS>	51.01206263415491
<SOS> you had your secret and we had ours ; we did n't exchange them . <EOS>	81.18799425841414
<SOS> so much the better ; it proves that we know how to keep our secrets . '' <EOS>	70.42904347277931
<SOS> `` i do not reproach you , monsieur , '' said d'artagnan ; `` 't is only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct . '' <EOS>	72.00730290049667
<SOS> `` and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame ? '' <EOS>	69.83440811820367
<SOS> asked aramis , haughtily . <EOS>	64.8806947392681
<SOS> the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d'artagnan , who arose , and replied : `` i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits . '' <EOS>	77.07352666034552
<SOS> on seeing d'artagnan rise , porthos rose also ; these four men were therefore all standing at the same time , with a menacing aspect , opposite to each other . <EOS>	91.08276275773379
<SOS> upon hearing d'artagnan 's reply , aramis seemed about to draw his sword , when athos prevented him . <EOS>	90.42520600916023
<SOS> `` d'artagnan , '' he said , `` you are here to night , still infuriated by yesterday 's adventure . <EOS>	106.7980221527081
<SOS> i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour . <EOS>	49.036096659104224
<SOS> come , do you really think you have anything to say against me ? <EOS>	72.25522232038143
<SOS> say it then ; if i am in fault i will avow the error . '' <EOS>	77.78191751325954
<SOS> the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence , whilst that of aramis , which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor , irritated him . <EOS>	83.97911926855069
<SOS> he answered therefore : `` i think , monsieur le comte , that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne , and that gentleman '' he pointed to aramis `` had also something to tell me when i was in his convent . <EOS>	57.928865155584155
<SOS> at that time i was not concerned in the adventure , in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me ! <EOS>	65.8673670472391
<SOS> however , because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool . <EOS>	68.60662869711835
<SOS> if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d'herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder , i could have spoken out . '' <EOS>	57.02954269078943
<SOS> `` what are you meddling with ? '' <EOS>	51.82143159803653
<SOS> cried aramis , pale with anger , suspecting that d'artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville . <EOS>	70.63244943973864
<SOS> `` i never meddle save with what concerns me , and i know how to make believe that i have n't seen what does not concern me ; but i hate hypocrites , and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers ; and , '' he added , turning to porthos `` here 's a gentleman who 's of the same opinion as myself . '' <EOS>	62.039244561731465
<SOS> porthos , who had not spoken one word , answered merely by a word and a gesture . <EOS>	60.95187491798325
<SOS> he said `` yes '' and he put his hand on his sword . <EOS>	80.80697606779069
<SOS> aramis started back and drew his . <EOS>	75.16820270262525
<SOS> d'artagnan bent forward , ready either to attack or to stand on his defense . <EOS>	87.64773717481607
<SOS> athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone , drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time , broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right . <EOS>	61.35479328983283
<SOS> then turning to aramis : `` aramis , '' he said , `` break your sword . '' <EOS>	77.42758752319267
<SOS> aramis hesitated . <EOS>	78.76765391557196
<SOS> `` it must be done , '' said athos ; then in a lower and more gentle voice , he added . <EOS>	92.05157586508827
<SOS> `` i wish it . '' <EOS>	96.0081453293065
<SOS> then aramis , paler than before , but subdued by these words , snapped the serpent blade between his hands , and then folding his arms , stood trembling with rage . <EOS>	60.91993172547856
<SOS> these proceedings made d'artagnan and porthos draw back . <EOS>	94.04366168196367
<SOS> d'artagnan did not draw his sword ; porthos put his back into the sheath . <EOS>	93.71580735936011
<SOS> `` never ! '' <EOS>	69.11786227238557
<SOS> exclaimed athos , raising his right hand to heaven , `` never ! <EOS>	97.25669867482655
<SOS> i swear before god , who seeth us , and who , in the darkness of this night heareth us , never shall my sword cross yours , never my eye express a glance of anger , nor my heart a throb of hatred , at you . <EOS>	86.5315549445002
<SOS> we lived together , we loved , we hated together ; we shed , we mingled our blood together , and too probably , i may still add , that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship ; perhaps there may be the bond of crime ; for we four , we once did condemn , judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world , although apparently fitter for hell than for this life . <EOS>	76.83053018122669
<SOS> d'artagnan , i have always loved you as my son ; porthos , we slept six years side by side ; aramis is your brother as well as mine , and aramis has once loved you , as i love you now and as i have ever loved you . <EOS>	98.93613859043936
<SOS> what can cardinal mazarin be to us , to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased ? <EOS>	64.51663966912645
<SOS> what is such or such a prince to us , who fixed the diadem upon a great queen 's head ? <EOS>	63.19291020857929
<SOS> d'artagnan , i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you ; aramis does the same to porthos ; now hate me if you can ; but for my own part , i shall ever , even if you do hate me , retain esteem and friendship for you . <EOS>	94.87215788559239
<SOS> i repeat my words , aramis , and then , if you desire it , and if they desire it , let us separate forever from our old friends . '' <EOS>	81.49044702872659
<SOS> there was a solemn , though momentary silence , which was broken by aramis . <EOS>	77.31223951231964
<SOS> `` i swear , '' he said , with a calm brow and kindly glance , but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion , `` i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends . <EOS>	120.41999967155635
<SOS> i regret that i ever crossed swords with you , porthos ; i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast , but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment ; now , athos , come . '' <EOS>	99.43001973589713
<SOS> athos was about to retire . <EOS>	80.60305134714355
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	54.895748666082106

<SOS> no ! <EOS>	47.40857824581323
<SOS> do not go away ! '' <EOS>	67.41222221381355
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature , the native brightness of his character ; `` i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you , athos of such a man as you , aramis . '' <EOS>	78.46348503726011
<SOS> and he threw himself into the arms of athos . <EOS>	63.451982369989814
<SOS> `` my son ! '' <EOS>	66.95452943161253
<SOS> exclaimed athos , pressing him in his arms . <EOS>	46.84030604785888
<SOS> `` and as for me , '' said porthos , `` i swear nothing , but i 'm choked . <EOS>	52.75906139740079
<SOS> forsooth ! <EOS>	50.42712017345541
<SOS> if i were obliged to fight against you , i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through , for i never loved any one but you in the wide world ; '' and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos . <EOS>	100.53765433729224
<SOS> `` my friends , '' said athos , `` this is what i expected from such hearts as yours . <EOS>	74.62201468906864
<SOS> yes , i have said it and i now repeat it : our destinies are irrevocably united , although we now pursue divergent roads . <EOS>	84.62520593393549
<SOS> i respect your convictions , and whilst we fight for opposite sides , let us remain friends . <EOS>	99.97142421848137
<SOS> ministers , princes , kings , will pass away like mountain torrents ; civil war , like a forest flame ; but we we shall remain ; i have a presentiment that we shall . '' <EOS>	98.30443222824682
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied d'artagnan , `` let us still be musketeers , and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st. gervais , on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered . '' <EOS>	50.60742099846603
<SOS> `` be it so , '' cried aramis . <EOS>	66.10889966783738
<SOS> `` cardinalists or frondeurs , what matters it ? <EOS>	93.2748989779601
<SOS> let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel , devoted friends in business , merry companions in our ancient pleasures . '' <EOS>	54.37997248080225
<SOS> `` and whenever , '' added athos , `` we meet in battle , at this word , 'place royale ! ' <EOS>	41.547754453410256
<SOS> let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right , even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage . '' <EOS>	79.68779174975494
<SOS> `` you speak charmingly , '' said porthos . <EOS>	101.36222608442421
<SOS> `` and are the first of men ! '' <EOS>	108.25455904268378
<SOS> added d'artagnan . <EOS>	62.42451141740506
<SOS> `` you excel us all . '' <EOS>	59.04474894389931
<SOS> athos smiled with ineffable pleasure . <EOS>	54.88646264184517
<SOS> `` 't is then all settled . <EOS>	62.70036770594238
<SOS> gentlemen , your hands ; are we not pretty good christians ? '' <EOS>	96.94155870063354
<SOS> `` egad ! '' <EOS>	54.313641577455925
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` by heaven ! <EOS>	71.21707616216857
<SOS> yes . '' <EOS>	71.00640293585153
<SOS> `` we should be so on this occasion , if only to be faithful to our oath , '' said aramis . <EOS>	64.92923871390138
<SOS> `` ah , i 'm ready to do what you will , '' cried porthos ; `` even to swear by mahomet . <EOS>	93.67089744332222
<SOS> devil take me if i 've ever been so happy as at this moment . '' <EOS>	48.20423354278561
<SOS> and he wiped his eyes , still moist . <EOS>	83.81086568518862
<SOS> `` has not one of you a cross ? '' <EOS>	55.557626710721834
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	59.17296992396805
<SOS> aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds , which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls . <EOS>	107.67620342336619
<SOS> `` here is one , '' he said . <EOS>	70.51680621081776
<SOS> `` well , '' resumed athos , `` swear on this cross , which , in spite of its magnificent material , is still a cross ; swear to be united in spite of everything , and forever , and may this oath bind us to each other , and even , also , our descendants ! <EOS>	73.62048676741962
<SOS> does this oath satisfy you ? '' <EOS>	88.65131138386114
<SOS> `` yes , '' said they all , with one accord . <EOS>	62.649473838111476
<SOS> `` ah , traitor ! '' <EOS>	100.19630550401652
<SOS> muttered d'artagnan , leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear , `` you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse . '' <EOS>	72.8316301332625
<SOS> chapter xxix . <EOS>	79.49348287551082
<SOS> the ferry across the oise . <EOS>	109.1800873925627
<SOS> we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders . <EOS>	81.39331139993207
<SOS> in losing sight of his guardian , whom he had quitted , gazing after him in front of the royal basilican , raoul spurred on his horse , in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections , but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray . <EOS>	98.21931685192658
<SOS> one hour 's rapid progress , however , sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man 's bright anticipations ; and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth , but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future . <EOS>	62.8866720109889
<SOS> nevertheless , after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull ; and the count 's agreeable voice , his gentle and persuasive eloquence , recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos , the most amusing and the best informed of guides . <EOS>	77.26629812790284
<SOS> another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul : on their arrival at sonores he had perceived , hidden behind a screen of poplars , a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it , and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain 's respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention . <EOS>	51.00302406237532
<SOS> the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory , which in spite of us will arouse them at times ; this thread , like that of ariadne , when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought , in which one loses one 's self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection . <EOS>	70.33813684164404
<SOS> now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time ; and every branch of oak , every gilded weathercock on roof of slates , reminded him that , instead of returning to the friends of his childhood , every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever . <EOS>	64.02304197741942
<SOS> with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn , which he observed within gunshot range , a little in advance of the place they had reached . <EOS>	71.84281184969117
<SOS> as for himself , he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower , amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees , and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink , to be placed on a table which he found there , conveniently ready . <EOS>	84.78394455314273
<SOS> olivain obeyed and continued on his way , whilst raoul remained sitting , with his elbow leaning on the table , from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head , which fell upon him like snow , and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him , dotted over with green fields and groups of trees . <EOS>	66.40441707692865
<SOS> raoul had been there about ten minutes , during five of which he was lost in reverie , when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face , who , with a napkin around his body , another under his arm , and a white cap upon his head , approached him , holding paper , pen and ink in hand . <EOS>	102.88171050163412
<SOS> `` ha ! <EOS>	64.18617885385187
<SOS> ha ! '' <EOS>	93.93314763224907
<SOS> laughed the apparition , `` every gentleman seems to have the same fancy , for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad , well mounted like you , as tall as you and of about your age , halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here , and dined here , with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor , upon a pie , of which they have n't left a mouthful , and two bottles of macon wine , of which they have n't left a drop , but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left , and if your worship will but give your orders `` `` no , friend , '' replied raoul , smiling , `` i am obliged to you , but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good ; upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle , and for the ink the price of the pie . '' <EOS>	77.57758820528517
<SOS> `` very well , sir , '' said the host , `` i 'll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant , and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain . '' <EOS>	87.40694192342961
<SOS> `` do as you like , '' said raoul , who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society , who , when there were robbers on the highroads , were connected with them , and who , since highwaymen no longer exist , have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place . <EOS>	57.69327986524636
<SOS> the host , his mind at ease about his bill , placed pen , ink and paper upon the table . <EOS>	87.05477421889088
<SOS> by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write . <EOS>	87.80990520788885
<SOS> the host remained standing in front of him , looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face , combining both gravity and sweetness of expression . <EOS>	59.776327455518114
<SOS> beauty has always been and always will be all powerful . <EOS>	58.540242237261445
<SOS> `` he 's not a guest like the other one here just now , '' observed mine host to olivain , who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything , `` and your young master has no appetite . '' <EOS>	107.24571822460679
<SOS> `` my master had appetite enough three days ago , but what can one do ? <EOS>	90.92375841978425
<SOS> he lost it the day before yesterday . '' <EOS>	70.17666636380825
<SOS> and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn , olivain , according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place , relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman ; whilst raoul wrote on thus : `` sir , after a four hours ' march i stop to write to you , for i miss you every moment , and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me . <EOS>	80.07651811710095
<SOS> i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation , that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you . <EOS>	47.057458263589815
<SOS> you will forgive me , sir , for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine . <EOS>	63.745463318735084
<SOS> i entreat you to write to me , for you form a part of my existence , and , if i may venture to tell you so , i also feel anxious . <EOS>	63.86336105078017
<SOS> it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking , about which i did not dare to question you , since you told me nothing . <EOS>	51.433800302482524
<SOS> i have , therefore , as you see , great need of hearing from you . <EOS>	73.74737883960158
<SOS> now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring . <EOS>	84.48083903535274
<SOS> you sustained me powerfully , sir , and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely . <EOS>	54.15858641477609
<SOS> will you have the goodness , sir , should you receive news from blois , to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere , about whose health , when we left , so much anxiety was felt ? <EOS>	93.4288147382501
<SOS> you can understand , honored and dear guardian , how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you . <EOS>	63.25660410809485
<SOS> i hope that you will sometimes , too , think of me , and if at certain hours you should miss me , if you should feel any slight regret at my absence , i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself , and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you . '' <EOS>	86.73075275828927
<SOS> after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him , whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper , a mute and touching caress , which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter . <EOS>	96.5180306583793
<SOS> during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie ; the horses were also refreshed . <EOS>	78.1592568899156
<SOS> raoul motioned to the host to approach , threw a crown upon the table , mounted his horse , and posted his letter at senlis . <EOS>	108.88531296487156
<SOS> the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace . <EOS>	90.39303578382926
<SOS> at verberie , raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them ; he had been observed to pass only three quarters of an hour previously , but he was well mounted , as the tavern keeper had already said , and rode at a rapid pace . <EOS>	72.47905723320257
<SOS> `` let us try and overtake this gentleman , '' said raoul to olivain ; `` like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company . '' <EOS>	50.96241946280634
<SOS> it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne ; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them . <EOS>	79.53755602079752
<SOS> he had stopped , like raoul , at the hotel of the bell and bottle , the best at compiegne ; and had started again on his journey , saying that he should sleep at noyon . <EOS>	79.76112600755854
<SOS> `` well , let us sleep at noyon , '' said raoul . <EOS>	66.68070546746337
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied olivain , respectfully , `` allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning . <EOS>	82.27442867581112
<SOS> i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow . <EOS>	97.45316380456663
<SOS> eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage . '' <EOS>	48.630897268532415
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on , '' replied raoul , `` that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day ; let us push on , then , to noyon ; it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris . <EOS>	40.92542929009749
<SOS> we shall arrive at eight o'clock . <EOS>	84.51215795069298
<SOS> the horses will have a long night 's rest , and at five o'clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road . '' <EOS>	57.435574304319054
<SOS> olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master , grumbling . <EOS>	46.518320163652774
<SOS> `` go on , go on , '' said he , between his teeth , `` expend your ardor the first day ; to morrow , instead of journeying twenty leagues , you will travel ten , the day after to morrow , five , and in three days you will be in bed . <EOS>	66.0833075443462
<SOS> there you must rest ; young people are such braggarts . '' <EOS>	47.895451063985945
<SOS> it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds . <EOS>	118.18543278103986
<SOS> raoul really felt tired , but he was desirous of testing his strength , and , brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues , he did not wish to fall far short of his model . <EOS>	99.94749780910041
<SOS> d'artagnan , that man of iron , who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only , had struck him with admiration . <EOS>	76.98116444726311
<SOS> therefore , in spite of olivain 's remarks , he continued to urge his steed more and more , and following a pleasant little path , leading to a ferry , and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league , he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him . <EOS>	60.58084906191276
<SOS> a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream , ready to embark . <EOS>	64.96041139802266
<SOS> raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort ; he called out to him , but they were too distant to be heard ; then , in spite of the weariness of his beast , he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers , and when he had again attained a new height , the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank . <EOS>	53.631574384662926
<SOS> raoul , seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers , halted to wait for olivain . <EOS>	74.79865005548038
<SOS> at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river . <EOS>	70.94185269029705
<SOS> raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded , and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand . <EOS>	71.15788945993323
<SOS> `` olivain ! '' <EOS>	75.42718490114049
<SOS> he exclaimed , `` what do i see below there ? '' <EOS>	74.34990436634445
<SOS> a second scream , more piercing than the first , now sounded . <EOS>	84.04235014212739
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	59.596478128369675
<SOS> cried olivain , `` the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting . <EOS>	58.168514817273156
<SOS> but what do i see in the water something struggling ? '' <EOS>	83.0624780556595
<SOS> `` oh , yes , '' exclaimed raoul , fixing his glance on one point in the stream , splendidly illumined by the setting sun , `` a horse , a rider ! '' <EOS>	102.10392522880748
<SOS> `` they are sinking ! '' <EOS>	84.39220335713364
<SOS> cried olivain in his turn . <EOS>	54.32145566859739
<SOS> it was true , and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning ; he gave his horse its head , struck his spurs into its sides , and the animal , urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him , bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place , and fell into the river , scattering to a distance waves of white froth . <EOS>	74.36165195288775
<SOS> `` ah , sir ! '' <EOS>	56.998727898800745
<SOS> cried olivain , `` what are you doing ? <EOS>	57.823368324874735
<SOS> good god ! '' <EOS>	84.37120746917847
<SOS> raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger . <EOS>	87.16268764870692
<SOS> this was , in fact , a custom familiar to him . <EOS>	101.00020861599457
<SOS> having been brought up on the banks of the loire , he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves ; a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback , a thousand times had swum across . <EOS>	60.045349916963424
<SOS> athos , foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount , had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings . <EOS>	76.93219358953583
<SOS> `` oh , heavens ! '' <EOS>	88.92497911477895
<SOS> continued olivain , in despair , `` what would the count say if he only saw you now ! '' <EOS>	115.05608871726837
<SOS> `` the count would do as i do , '' replied raoul , urging his horse vigorously forward . <EOS>	76.98560003755355
<SOS> `` but i but i , '' cried olivain , pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore , `` how shall i cross ? '' <EOS>	64.62200353927616
<SOS> `` leap , coward ! '' <EOS>	87.23012331059955
<SOS> cried raoul , swimming on ; then addressing the traveler , who was struggling twenty yards in front of him : `` courage , sir ! '' <EOS>	73.72292288223083
<SOS> said he , `` courage ! <EOS>	57.42256821651541
<SOS> we are coming to your aid . '' <EOS>	77.18543501127209
<SOS> olivain advanced , retired , then made his horse rear turned it and then , struck to the core by shame , leaped , as raoul had done , only repeating : `` i am a dead man ! <EOS>	78.78340101931659
<SOS> we are lost ! '' <EOS>	71.91774212970216
<SOS> in the meantime , the ferryboat had floated away , carried down by the stream , and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more . <EOS>	75.91080265294426
<SOS> a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning ; but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly . <EOS>	66.7704765942055
<SOS> raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground ; but the horse and its rider , of whom he did not lose sight , were evidently sinking . <EOS>	47.058430627453674
<SOS> the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water , and the rider , who had lost the reins in struggling , fell with his head back and his arms extended . <EOS>	84.2037280632616
<SOS> one moment longer and all would disappear . <EOS>	65.86414341915736
<SOS> `` courage ! '' <EOS>	61.5214585421978
<SOS> cried raoul , `` courage ! '' <EOS>	79.24255251645839
<SOS> `` too late ! '' <EOS>	73.31727211472574
<SOS> murmured the young man , `` too late ! '' <EOS>	74.24645574012742
<SOS> the water closed above his head and stifled his voice . <EOS>	113.4634696021742
<SOS> raoul sprang from his horse , to which he left the charge of its own preservation , and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman 's side ; he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water ; the animal began to breathe again and , as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid , redoubled his efforts . <EOS>	59.88952973574129
<SOS> raoul at the same time seized one of the young man 's hands and placed it on the mane , which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man . <EOS>	75.57638103396165
<SOS> thus , sure that the rider would not release his hold , raoul now only directed his attention to the horse , which he guided to the opposite bank , helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words . <EOS>	67.97967405946508
<SOS> all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand . <EOS>	72.42133737785481
<SOS> `` saved ! '' <EOS>	57.5789027841852
<SOS> exclaimed the man with gray hair , who also touched bottom . <EOS>	109.98022746721486
<SOS> `` saved ! '' <EOS>	62.92568963780079
<SOS> mechanically repeated the young gentleman , releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul 's arms ; raoul was but ten yards from the shore ; there he bore the fainting man , and laying him down upon the grass , unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet . <EOS>	117.17798928537066
<SOS> a moment later the gray headed man was beside him . <EOS>	66.15130234975626
<SOS> olivain managed in his turn to land , after crossing himself repeatedly ; and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank , with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat . <EOS>	110.39996300353117
<SOS> thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman , the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man , who opened his eyes , at first entirely bewildered , but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him . <EOS>	59.397232283755066
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' he exclaimed , `` it was you ! <EOS>	64.51448215815778
<SOS> without you i was a dead man thrice dead . '' <EOS>	77.5805318033189
<SOS> `` but one recovers , sir , as you perceive , '' replied raoul , `` and we have but had a little bath . '' <EOS>	69.37479442892503
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	71.88890233336524
<SOS> sir , what gratitude i feel ! '' <EOS>	57.58226373476176
<SOS> exclaimed the man with gray hair . <EOS>	71.9801316897863
<SOS> `` ah , there you are , my good d'arminges ; i have given you a great fright , have i not ? <EOS>	77.22070205827077
<SOS> but it is your own fault . <EOS>	77.51972552506062
<SOS> you were my tutor , why did you not teach me to swim ? '' <EOS>	62.28095289620703
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur le comte , '' replied the old man , `` had any misfortune happened to you , i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again . '' <EOS>	90.77250305452573
<SOS> `` but how did the accident happen ? '' <EOS>	83.33727452893751
<SOS> asked raoul . <EOS>	98.70983833258431
<SOS> `` oh , sir , in the most natural way possible , '' replied he to whom they had given the title of count . <EOS>	43.82640481151223
<SOS> `` we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke . <EOS>	83.31254650893885
<SOS> alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen , my horse sprang into the water . <EOS>	89.71966998290685
<SOS> i can not swim , and dared not throw myself into the river . <EOS>	110.12908860349661
<SOS> instead of aiding the movements of my horse , i paralyzed them ; and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world , when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water ; therefore , sir , if you will agree , henceforward we are friends until death . '' <EOS>	85.35161323252828
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied raoul , bowing , `` i am entirely at your service , i assure you . '' <EOS>	83.87518859939291
<SOS> `` i am called the count de guiche , '' continued the young man ; `` my father is the marechal de grammont ; and now that you know who i am , do me the honor to inform me who you are . '' <EOS>	98.60792639422668
<SOS> `` i am the viscount de bragelonne , '' answered raoul , blushing at being unable to name his father , as the count de guiche had done . <EOS>	82.2520987983808
<SOS> `` viscount , your countenance , your goodness and your courage incline me toward you ; my gratitude is already due . <EOS>	108.01890612070872
<SOS> shake hands i crave your friendship . '' <EOS>	43.59182723665399
<SOS> `` sir , '' said raoul , returning the count 's pressure of the hand , `` i like you already , from my heart ; pray regard me as a devoted friend , i beseech you . '' <EOS>	52.01781444185036
<SOS> `` and now , where are you going , viscount ? '' <EOS>	52.31653667241717
<SOS> inquired de guiche . <EOS>	105.62191350097402
<SOS> `` to join the army , under the prince , count . '' <EOS>	83.17791514363007
<SOS> `` and i , too ! '' <EOS>	102.31949404939876
<SOS> exclaimed the young man , in a transport of joy . <EOS>	70.27099282776373
<SOS> `` oh , so much the better , we will fire the first shot together . '' <EOS>	90.64472383712766
<SOS> `` it is well ; be friends , '' said the tutor ; `` young as you both are , you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet . <EOS>	85.70258014903514
<SOS> and now , '' continued he , `` you must change your clothes ; your servants , to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat , ought to be already at the inn . <EOS>	88.0433304436725
<SOS> linen and wine are both being warmed ; come . '' <EOS>	108.66758784815488
<SOS> the young men had no objection to this proposition ; on the contrary , they thought it very timely . <EOS>	78.2814704535922
<SOS> they mounted again at once , whilst looks of admiration passed between them . <EOS>	80.05031058693027
<SOS> they were indeed two elegant horsemen , with figures slight and upright , noble faces , bright and proud looks , loyal and intelligent smiles . <EOS>	80.8633214605276
<SOS> de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age , but he was scarcely taller than raoul , who was only fifteen . <EOS>	58.80292255322665
<SOS> chapter xxx . <EOS>	70.36133580815483
<SOS> skirmishing . <EOS>	68.26838742264117
<SOS> the halt at noyon was but brief , every one there being wrapped in profound sleep . <EOS>	89.97406511999634
<SOS> raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive , but grimaud did not arrive . <EOS>	80.441865171364
<SOS> doubtless , too , the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them . <EOS>	88.5709870912238
<SOS> the count de guiche was awakened at five o'clock in the morning by raoul , who came to wish him good day . <EOS>	93.1832919263266
<SOS> they breakfasted in haste , and at six o'clock had already gone ten miles . <EOS>	45.10681409597543
<SOS> the young count 's conversation was most interesting to raoul , therefore he listened much , whilst the count talked well and long . <EOS>	88.83941630254935
<SOS> brought up in paris , where raoul had been but once ; at the court , which raoul had never seen ; his follies as page ; two duels , which he had already found the means of fighting , in spite of the edicts against them and , more especially , in spite of his tutor 's vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul . <EOS>	63.11059901293743
<SOS> raoul had only been at m. scarron 's house ; he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there . <EOS>	47.648276393927254
<SOS> guiche knew everybody madame de neuillan , mademoiselle d'aubigne , mademoiselle de scudery , mademoiselle paulet , madame de chevreuse . <EOS>	85.96010394951928
<SOS> he criticised everybody humorously . <EOS>	90.93208292099285
<SOS> raoul trembled , lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse , for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy , but either instinctively , or from affection for the duchess , he said everything in her favor . <EOS>	116.75988752663737
<SOS> his praises increased raoul 's friendship twofold . <EOS>	74.52190472605935
<SOS> then came the question of gallantry and love affairs . <EOS>	59.99755019910631
<SOS> under this head , also , bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell . <EOS>	98.80177012059472
<SOS> he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures , that the count , like himself , had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart . <EOS>	49.91458038627681
<SOS> de guiche , as we have said before , had been educated at the court , and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him . <EOS>	67.61485579241459
<SOS> it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak , except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it ; therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion . <EOS>	44.30814988164562
<SOS> the young count , witty and caustic , passed all the world in review ; the queen herself was not spared , and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule . <EOS>	83.82964980758655
<SOS> the day passed away as rapidly as an hour . <EOS>	56.75820761091019
<SOS> the count 's tutor , a man of the world and a bon vivant , up to his eyes in learning , as his pupil described him , often recalled the profound erudition , the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul ; but as regarded grace , delicacy , and nobility of external appearance , no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere . <EOS>	70.47561782819776
<SOS> the horses , which were more kindly used than on the previous day , stopped at arras at four o'clock in the evening . <EOS>	77.9830404491315
<SOS> they were approaching the scene of war ; and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras , they determined to remain in the town until the morrow . <EOS>	66.93360969469707
<SOS> the french army held all between pont a marc as far as valenciennes , falling back upon douai . <EOS>	76.3243914751214
<SOS> the prince was said to be in person at bethune . <EOS>	74.51105743795091
<SOS> the enemy 's army extended from cassel to courtray ; and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit , the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them . <EOS>	95.36229927260928
<SOS> arras was encumbered with fugitives . <EOS>	110.39699029704944
<SOS> an approaching battle was much spoken of , the prince having manoeuvred , until that movement , only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him . <EOS>	78.66351208183643
<SOS> the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely . <EOS>	43.7333076215997
<SOS> the evening was employed in discussing the war ; the grooms polished their arms ; the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish , and they awoke in despair , having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle . <EOS>	66.13024119963686
<SOS> in the morning it was rumored that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin , leaving , however , a strong garrison in the former city . <EOS>	64.15338093533884
<SOS> but as there was nothing positively certain in this report , the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune , free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary . <EOS>	76.35450671001678
<SOS> the count 's tutor was well acquainted with the country ; he consequently proposed to take a crossroad , which lay between that of lens and that of bethune . <EOS>	74.23151760727201
<SOS> they obtained information at ablain , and a statement of their route was left for grimaud . <EOS>	67.26766994239247
<SOS> about seven o'clock in the morning they set out . <EOS>	88.07346920756635
<SOS> de guiche , who was young and impulsive , said to raoul , `` here we are , three masters and three servants . <EOS>	92.17609229311131
<SOS> our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough . '' <EOS>	97.15924280048087
<SOS> `` i have never seen him put to the test , '' replied raoul , `` but he is a breton , which promises something . '' <EOS>	61.8169757804723
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' resumed de guiche ; `` i am sure he can fire a musket when required . <EOS>	112.824609005026
<SOS> on my side i have two sure men , who have been in action with my father . <EOS>	68.1485235572652
<SOS> we therefore represent six fighting men ; if we should meet a little troop of enemies , equal or even superior in number to our own , shall we charge them , raoul ? '' <EOS>	70.2615599730004
<SOS> `` certainly , sir , '' replied the viscount . <EOS>	57.60599982621522
<SOS> `` holloa ! <EOS>	55.368164203183284
<SOS> young people stop there ! '' <EOS>	73.44061580244853
<SOS> said the tutor , joining in the conversation . <EOS>	68.95256940649965
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	64.85402136963613
<SOS> how you manoeuvre my instructions , count ! <EOS>	70.24757983083099
<SOS> you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince ! <EOS>	58.692409976253586
<SOS> once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure ; but until that time , i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across . '' <EOS>	57.41270664285742
<SOS> de guiche and raoul glanced at each other , smiling . <EOS>	76.46170567873054
<SOS> they arrived at ablain without accident . <EOS>	83.99248391471436
<SOS> there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between cambria and la venthie . <EOS>	98.19177638956748
<SOS> therefore , leaving directions at every place for grimaud , they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys . <EOS>	64.85791640935791
<SOS> the country was beautiful , intersected by valleys as green as the emerald . <EOS>	48.84736487852876
<SOS> here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following . <EOS>	65.38631109797547
<SOS> in anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band , thus forming the advance guard . <EOS>	73.67366345735402
<SOS> himself and the two young men represented the body of the army , whilst olivain , with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch , protected the rear . <EOS>	74.14609112946037
<SOS> they had observed for some time before them , on the horizon , a rather thick wood ; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it , monsieur d'arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count 's two grooms . <EOS>	50.37226307959463
<SOS> the servants had just disappeared under the trees , followed by the tutor , and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off . <EOS>	80.92109548214407
<SOS> olivain was at the same distance in the rear , when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots . <EOS>	66.91214247742208
<SOS> the tutor cried halt ; the young men obeyed , pulling up their steeds , and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop . <EOS>	87.35088935374586
<SOS> the young men , impatient to learn the cause of the firing , spurred on toward the servants . <EOS>	63.9154736454623
<SOS> the tutor followed them . <EOS>	44.07407003062293
<SOS> `` were you stopped ? '' <EOS>	57.65029043748427
<SOS> eagerly inquired the two youths . <EOS>	62.68867138728552
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the servants , `` it is even probable that we have not been seen ; the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us , in the thickest part of the wood , and we returned to ask your advice . '' <EOS>	74.10711769012218
<SOS> `` my advice is this , '' said monsieur d'arminges , `` and if needs be , my will , that we beat a retreat . <EOS>	95.17574037506566
<SOS> there may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood . '' <EOS>	85.41556521857034
<SOS> `` did you see nothing there ? '' <EOS>	79.17285423386105
<SOS> asked the count . <EOS>	84.1503780909699
<SOS> `` i thought i saw , '' said one of the servants , `` horsemen dressed in yellow , creeping along the bed of the stream . <EOS>	89.55494547559844
<SOS> `` that 's it , '' said the tutor . <EOS>	72.04910319175941
<SOS> `` we have fallen in with a party of spaniards . <EOS>	64.19425285733209
<SOS> come back , sirs , back . '' <EOS>	56.11164016105666
<SOS> the two youths looked at each other , and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard . <EOS>	57.647731551054626
<SOS> another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back , and as the tutor had already turned his horse 's head , they both spurred forward , raoul crying : `` follow me , olivain ! '' <EOS>	53.43747592593468
<SOS> and the count de guiche : `` follow , urban and planchet ! '' <EOS>	53.43548927622516
<SOS> and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest . <EOS>	84.7087100460706
<SOS> whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also . <EOS>	71.56136809458421
<SOS> in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded , and then restraining their horses , they advanced cautiously . <EOS>	80.87888111223629
<SOS> `` hush , '' whispered de guiche , `` these are cavaliers . '' <EOS>	59.41935239462511
<SOS> `` yes , three on horseback and three who have dismounted . '' <EOS>	47.04492198186681
<SOS> `` can you see what they are doing ? '' <EOS>	63.0182874959844
<SOS> `` yes , they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man . '' <EOS>	67.47722502932113
<SOS> `` it is some cowardly assassination , '' said de guiche . <EOS>	103.82546026681148
<SOS> `` they are soldiers , though , '' resumed de bragelonne . <EOS>	72.56711722486133
<SOS> `` yes , skirmishers ; that is to say , highway robbers . '' <EOS>	61.79217512462956
<SOS> `` at them ! '' <EOS>	69.71703936269137
<SOS> cried raoul . <EOS>	79.71777129067488
<SOS> `` at them ! '' <EOS>	57.940723678026664
<SOS> echoed de guiche . <EOS>	63.759802477254546
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	91.22373571375753
<SOS> gentlemen ! <EOS>	53.83840909993329
<SOS> gentlemen ! <EOS>	53.16162832762046
<SOS> in the name of heaven ! '' <EOS>	85.53648278871425
<SOS> cried the poor tutor . <EOS>	60.076698390844165
<SOS> but he was not listened to , and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards . <EOS>	85.64673001843343
<SOS> the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths , leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers ; for on approaching nearer , instead of one extended figure , the young men discovered two . <EOS>	85.75390068314339
<SOS> de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man ; and the spaniard , who had advanced to meet raoul , aimed in his turn , and raoul felt a pain in the left arm , similar to that of a blow from a whip . <EOS>	71.63371674950594
<SOS> he let off his fire at but four paces . <EOS>	82.23553214795493
<SOS> struck in the breast and extending his arms , the spaniard fell back on the crupper , and the terrified horse , turning around , carried him off . <EOS>	79.19888498519643
<SOS> raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him , and remembering the recommendation of athos , he , with the rapidity of lightning , made his horse rear as the shot was fired . <EOS>	72.40891836320974
<SOS> his horse bounded to one side , losing its footing , and fell , entangling raoul 's leg under its body . <EOS>	93.26533400485182
<SOS> the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle , in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt . <EOS>	54.89668636676529
<SOS> in the position in which raoul lay , unfortunately , he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard , nor his pistols from their holsters . <EOS>	95.04792198301135
<SOS> the butt end of the musket hovered over his head , and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes , when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat . <EOS>	48.629654509324126
<SOS> `` yield ! '' <EOS>	89.64085424064955
<SOS> he cried , `` or you are a dead man ! '' <EOS>	66.83912784721961
<SOS> the musket fell from the soldier 's hands , who yielded on the instant . <EOS>	68.48221051727042
<SOS> guiche summoned one of his grooms , and delivering the prisoner into his charge , with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape , he leaped from his horse and approached raoul . <EOS>	49.17067618352481
<SOS> `` faith , sir , '' said raoul , smiling , although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair , `` you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me . <EOS>	51.339702839448805
<SOS> without your aid , '' continued he , repeating the count 's words `` i should have been a dead man thrice dead . '' <EOS>	73.61149646445378
<SOS> `` my antagonist took flight , '' replied de guiche `` and left me at liberty to come to your assistance . <EOS>	66.60803716284663
<SOS> but are you seriously wounded ? <EOS>	49.798274590757046
<SOS> i see you are covered with blood ! '' <EOS>	61.58003308073911
<SOS> `` i believe , '' said raoul , `` that i have got something like a scratch on the arm . <EOS>	77.63098669253252
<SOS> if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey . '' <EOS>	52.01076694786953
<SOS> monsieur d'arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse . <EOS>	48.80333007298839
<SOS> at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal , and in a second he was on his feet again . <EOS>	69.40871438901156
<SOS> `` nothing broken ? '' <EOS>	45.78980754379033
<SOS> asked de guiche . <EOS>	92.39233000426604
<SOS> `` faith , no , thank heaven ! '' <EOS>	73.50283169938156
<SOS> replied raoul ; `` but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering ? '' <EOS>	56.83112787985797
<SOS> `` i fear we arrived too late . <EOS>	70.26830603436389
<SOS> they have killed them , i think , and taken flight , carrying off their booty . <EOS>	94.82679644505419
<SOS> my servants are examining the bodies . '' <EOS>	73.98784947249177
<SOS> `` let us go and see whether they are quite dead , or if they can still be helped , '' suggested raoul . <EOS>	76.35055136283297
<SOS> `` olivain , we have come into possession of two horses , but i have lost my own . <EOS>	50.17534950049299
<SOS> take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours . '' <EOS>	55.75802800220871
<SOS> they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay . <EOS>	55.32954374106982

<SOS> the monk . <EOS>	49.27955209018015
<SOS> two men lay prone upon the ground , one bathed in blood and motionless , with his face toward the earth ; this one was dead . <EOS>	66.55465375679607
<SOS> the other leaned against a tree , supported there by the two valets , and was praying fervently , with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven . <EOS>	72.73098884190001
<SOS> he had received a ball in his thigh , which had broken the bone . <EOS>	56.95066002486827
<SOS> the young men first approached the dead man . <EOS>	44.13258259744488

<SOS> `` i swear to you , you shall receive the consolation that you ask . <EOS>	113.10606217286633

<SOS> monk or priest , it matters not , provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis . '' <EOS>	95.7627430474765
<SOS> `` monsieur d'arminges , '' said de guiche , `` remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible . <EOS>	53.31891580201805

<SOS> besides , we are safe for to day ; you know the axiom , 'non bis in idem . ' '' <EOS>	40.63506323614512
<SOS> `` courage , sir , '' said raoul to the wounded man . <EOS>	63.05641173465534
<SOS> `` we are going to execute your wishes . '' <EOS>	57.00157812446486
<SOS> `` may heaven prosper you ! '' <EOS>	84.20383342138874
<SOS> replied the dying man , with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe . <EOS>	60.59118941175994
<SOS> the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn . <EOS>	66.76975296090069
<SOS> raoul , without dismounting , called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful . <EOS>	110.35440936640433
<SOS> he desired him also , should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon , to fetch him , taking on himself the payment of the messenger . <EOS>	99.85590926465149
<SOS> the host , who saw two young noblemen , richly clad , promised everything they required , and our two cavaliers , after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun , started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney . <EOS>	44.31148939652083
<SOS> they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village , the red tiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them , when , coming toward them mounted on a mule , they perceived a poor monk , whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother . <EOS>	83.70398175280187
<SOS> chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking . <EOS>	57.531169075601824
<SOS> he was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old , but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises . <EOS>	104.22179628074375
<SOS> his complexion was pale , not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty , but of a bilious , yellow hue ; his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head , and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression . <EOS>	81.60682241666537
<SOS> `` sir , '' began raoul , with his usual politeness , `` are you an ecclesiastic ? '' <EOS>	88.38161715466569
<SOS> `` why do you ask me that ? '' <EOS>	77.52999597782129
<SOS> replied the stranger , with a coolness which was barely civil . <EOS>	110.11536049345038
<SOS> `` because we want to know , '' said de guiche , haughtily . <EOS>	99.17750986658156
<SOS> the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way . <EOS>	53.12265655011582
<SOS> in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage . <EOS>	91.48472533424312
<SOS> `` answer , sir , '' exclaimed he ; `` you have been asked politely , and every question is worth an answer . '' <EOS>	56.77935915172905
<SOS> `` i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me . '' <EOS>	70.4615588475659
<SOS> it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk 's bones . <EOS>	59.34344660647473
<SOS> `` in the first place , '' he said , making an effort to control himself , `` we are not people who may be treated anyhow ; my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche . <EOS>	69.74897444589395
<SOS> nor was it from caprice we asked the question , for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church . <EOS>	69.08665430727784
<SOS> if you be a priest , i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man ; if you be not , it is a different matter , and i warn you in the name of courtesy , of which you appear profoundly ignorant , that i shall chastise you for your insolence . '' <EOS>	90.33728139522299
<SOS> the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange , that raoul , whose eyes were still fixed upon him , felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult . <EOS>	88.59913796568848
<SOS> `` he is some spanish or flemish spy , '' said he , putting his hand to his pistol . <EOS>	73.58268607763972
<SOS> a glance , threatening and transient as lightning , replied to raoul . <EOS>	79.60835352054403
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said de guiche , `` are you going to reply ? '' <EOS>	89.01056853600208
<SOS> `` i am a priest , '' said the young man . <EOS>	61.41366428464557
<SOS> `` then , father , '' said raoul , forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart , `` if you are a priest you have an opportunity , as my friend has told you , of exercising your vocation . <EOS>	74.95819131977522
<SOS> at the next inn you will find a wounded man , now being attended by our servants , who has asked the assistance of a minister of god . '' <EOS>	94.3407263517354
<SOS> `` i will go , '' said the monk . <EOS>	64.66642086952918
<SOS> and he touched his mule . <EOS>	57.072769042302674
<SOS> `` if you do not go , sir , '' said de guiche , `` remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be ; and then i swear your trial will be summary ; one can always find a tree and a cord . '' <EOS>	96.54790821316331
<SOS> the monk 's eye again flashed , but that was all ; he merely repeated his phrase , `` i will go , '' and he went . <EOS>	54.87102743562996
<SOS> `` let us follow him , '' said de guiche ; `` it will be the surest plan . '' <EOS>	52.886784197123234
<SOS> `` i was about to propose so doing , '' answered de bragelonne . <EOS>	98.1961098914412
<SOS> in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not . <EOS>	51.289516032803526
<SOS> `` you see , '' said raoul , `` we have done wisely . '' <EOS>	53.86908853327716
<SOS> `` what a horrible face that monk has , '' said de guiche . <EOS>	91.58354628612013
<SOS> `` horrible ! '' <EOS>	73.38290524863262
<SOS> replied raoul , `` especially in expression . '' <EOS>	65.09224179525407
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said de guiche , `` a strange face ; but these monks are subject to such degrading practices ; their fasts make them pale , the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites , and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy , but they have lost . '' <EOS>	46.70685379271823
<SOS> `` well , '' said raoul , `` the poor man will get his priest , but , by heaven , the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor . <EOS>	48.9813078965998
<SOS> i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance . '' <EOS>	67.86202521573227
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	75.37041937260803
<SOS> exclaimed de guiche , `` you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers , who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them ; they are mostly foreigners scotch , irish or danish . <EOS>	62.53861666824086
<SOS> i have seen them before . '' <EOS>	87.42308181898325
<SOS> `` as ugly ? '' <EOS>	61.47931028085475
<SOS> `` no , but reasonably hideous . '' <EOS>	83.21730193072236
<SOS> `` what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar ! '' <EOS>	81.04507919931316
<SOS> `` pshaw ! '' <EOS>	71.59608220016176
<SOS> said de guiche . <EOS>	72.57845699693979
<SOS> `` absolution comes not from him who administers it , but from god . <EOS>	82.14388446276962
<SOS> however , for my part , i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor . <EOS>	65.20281500006571
<SOS> you are of my opinion , are you not , viscount ? <EOS>	107.44345507980034
<SOS> and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword , as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father 's head . '' <EOS>	79.47527076003571
<SOS> `` yes , count , it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you , but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man . <EOS>	98.66457947816058
<SOS> have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path ? '' <EOS>	96.28065141729972
<SOS> `` never , '' answered de guiche . <EOS>	89.71081981982594
<SOS> `` well , it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests , and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me , curled up , swinging its head and pointing its tongue , i remained fixed , pale and as though fascinated , until the moment when the comte de la fere `` `` your father ? '' <EOS>	71.87726728026944
<SOS> asked de guiche . <EOS>	55.632885672156505
<SOS> `` no , my guardian , '' replied raoul , blushing . <EOS>	89.51613152783833
<SOS> `` very well `` `` until the moment when the comte de la fere , '' resumed raoul , `` said , 'come , bragelonne , draw your sword ; ' then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two , just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing , ere it sprang upon me . <EOS>	67.8170221282573
<SOS> well , i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said , 'why do you ask me that ? ' <EOS>	48.53495554536797
<SOS> and looked so strangely at me . '' <EOS>	60.99346920221409
<SOS> `` then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels ? '' <EOS>	70.7442956743504
<SOS> `` faith , yes , almost , '' said raoul . <EOS>	80.07340674428444
<SOS> they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur d'arminges . <EOS>	80.75841249438547
<SOS> the youths spurred on . <EOS>	44.61803496149436
<SOS> `` there is the wounded man , '' said de guiche , passing close to the augustine brother . <EOS>	71.743954680551
<SOS> `` be good enough to hurry yourself a little , monsieur monk . '' <EOS>	91.59289806680418
<SOS> as for raoul , he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him , turning his head away in repulsion . <EOS>	80.42843819450397
<SOS> the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest . <EOS>	50.15639063557915
<SOS> he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out , saw the monk , and fell back upon the litter , his face illumined by joy . <EOS>	53.02828655749831
<SOS> `` and now , '' said the youths , `` we have done all we can for you ; and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince 's army we must continue our journey . <EOS>	105.10299228168846
<SOS> you will excuse us , sir , but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it . '' <EOS>	58.66297093177508
<SOS> `` go , my young sirs , '' said the sick man , `` and may you both be blessed for your piety . <EOS>	95.29387745027962
<SOS> you have done for me , as you promised , all that you could do . <EOS>	50.125774464348304
<SOS> as for me i can only repeat , may god protect you and all dear to you ! '' <EOS>	113.15023866659999
<SOS> `` sir , '' said de guiche to his tutor , `` we will precede you , and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin . '' <EOS>	78.14441997908939
<SOS> the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed , bandages , and lint ; and a groom had gone to lens , the nearest village , for a doctor . <EOS>	81.86481346817698
<SOS> `` everything , '' said he to raoul , `` shall be done as you desire ; but you will not stop to have your wound dressed ? '' <EOS>	68.21018501477377
<SOS> `` oh , my wound mine 't is nothing , '' replied the viscount ; `` it will be time to think about it when we next halt ; only have the goodness , should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant , to tell him , in fact , that you have seen me , but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin . <EOS>	86.89173634878344
<SOS> this cavalier is my attendant . '' <EOS>	65.00914154359613
<SOS> `` would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours ? '' <EOS>	115.0840810472429
<SOS> demanded the host . <EOS>	48.47154846922399
<SOS> `` there is no harm in over precaution . <EOS>	64.96189049584318
<SOS> i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud . '' <EOS>	108.62354861181053
<SOS> at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other , the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed . <EOS>	47.26108946274072
<SOS> `` sir monk , '' said de guiche , `` confess well that brave man ; and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule ; all is paid . '' <EOS>	98.91222959591195
<SOS> `` thanks , monsieur , '' said the monk , with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder . <EOS>	93.64474076283855
<SOS> `` come , count , '' said raoul , who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine ; `` come , i feel ill here , '' and the two young men spurred on . <EOS>	62.48968320763443
<SOS> the litter , borne by two servants , now entered the house . <EOS>	60.79342423208289
<SOS> the host and his wife were standing on the steps , whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk . <EOS>	77.60387893916214
<SOS> at sight of this pale , bleeding man , the wife grasped her husband 's arm . <EOS>	62.118872808972085
<SOS> `` well , what 's the matter ? '' <EOS>	90.05286940373574
<SOS> asked the latter , `` are you going to be ill just now ? '' <EOS>	75.94505253080158
<SOS> `` no , but look , '' replied the hostess , pointing to the wounded man ; `` i ask you if you recognize him ? '' <EOS>	85.78080268728944
<SOS> `` that man wait a bit . '' <EOS>	88.48151776619224
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	74.18919803519071
<SOS> i see you know him , '' exclaimed the wife ; `` for you have become pale in your turn . '' <EOS>	76.10354838125144
<SOS> `` truly , '' cried the host , `` misfortune is coming on our house ; it is the former executioner of bethune . '' <EOS>	75.68903265370466
<SOS> `` the former executioner of bethune ! '' <EOS>	65.89077976270447
<SOS> murmured the young monk , shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired . <EOS>	60.87787549120209
<SOS> monsieur d'arminges , who was at the door , perceived his hesitation . <EOS>	74.16824824333344
<SOS> `` sir monk , '' said he , `` whether he is now or has been an executioner , this unfortunate being is none the less a man . <EOS>	116.46662530302488
<SOS> render to him , then , the last service he can by any possibility ask of you , and your work will be all the more meritorious . '' <EOS>	75.73165629785036
<SOS> the monk made no reply , but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed . <EOS>	107.26590332718496
<SOS> d'arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses , and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion . <EOS>	46.15594362853927
<SOS> just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn , a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn . <EOS>	64.50437986187136
<SOS> `` what does your worship want ? '' <EOS>	63.183229639982336
<SOS> demanded the host , pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made . <EOS>	71.58994303333218
<SOS> the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink , and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something . <EOS>	76.87264323900222
<SOS> `` ah , diable ! '' <EOS>	84.2583718506624
<SOS> said the host to himself ; `` this man seems dumb . <EOS>	82.83537091260271
<SOS> and where will your worship drink ? '' <EOS>	65.77100790128614
<SOS> `` there , '' answered the traveler , pointing to the table . <EOS>	82.61624430027305
<SOS> `` i was mistaken , '' said the host , `` he 's not quite dumb . <EOS>	81.27181335084617
<SOS> and what else does your worship wish for ? '' <EOS>	78.49850879533554
<SOS> `` to know if you have seen a young man pass , fifteen years of age , mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom ? '' <EOS>	57.32559989231513
<SOS> `` the viscount de bragelonne ? <EOS>	80.9663892346579

<SOS> the traveler made a sign of assent . <EOS>	63.07042441678104
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said the host , `` your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago ; he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin . '' <EOS>	82.81331617911633
<SOS> `` how far is mazingarbe ? '' <EOS>	103.98934242197731
<SOS> `` two miles and a half . '' <EOS>	72.18821921446282
<SOS> `` thank you . '' <EOS>	99.6158118185556
<SOS> grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time , when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man . <EOS>	48.80694564289504
<SOS> grimaud sprang up . <EOS>	104.9088017992556
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	72.74255005869131
<SOS> said he ; `` whence comes that cry ? '' <EOS>	59.89848820461577
<SOS> `` from the wounded man 's room , '' replied the host . <EOS>	48.18236856002487
<SOS> `` what wounded man ? '' <EOS>	45.67644485711059
<SOS> `` the former executioner of bethune , who has just been brought in here , assassinated by spaniards , and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar . '' <EOS>	67.15365956985741
<SOS> `` the old executioner of bethune , '' muttered grimaud ; `` a man between fifty five and sixty , tall , strong , swarthy , black hair and beard ? '' <EOS>	82.29678840618021
<SOS> `` that is he , except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white ; do you know him ? '' <EOS>	69.42448860235106
<SOS> asked the host . <EOS>	67.00419337187348
<SOS> `` i have seen him once , '' replied grimaud , a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection . <EOS>	65.69786858065089
<SOS> at this instant a second cry , less piercing than the first , but followed by prolonged groaning , was heard . <EOS>	51.26348313407259
<SOS> the three listeners looked at one another in alarm . <EOS>	103.69158022931153
<SOS> `` we must see what it is , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	65.67064697895756
<SOS> `` it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered , '' murmured the host . <EOS>	76.57839451899132
<SOS> `` mon dieu ! '' <EOS>	79.03461071320615
<SOS> said the woman , crossing herself . <EOS>	73.0495088155072
<SOS> if grimaud was slow in speaking , we know that he was quick to act ; he sprang to the door and shook it violently , but it was bolted on the other side . <EOS>	92.49793158615356
<SOS> `` open the door ! '' <EOS>	83.15799377569341
<SOS> cried the host ; `` open it instantly , sir monk ! '' <EOS>	44.45590214734856
<SOS> no reply . <EOS>	58.04930365907225
<SOS> `` unfasten it , or i will break it in ! '' <EOS>	64.75787986385413
<SOS> said grimaud . <EOS>	71.87717224084786
<SOS> the same silence , and then , ere the host could oppose his design , grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt . <EOS>	40.7190386715371
<SOS> the room was inundated with blood , dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man , speechless ; the monk had disappeared . <EOS>	66.61593880735249
<SOS> `` the monk ! '' <EOS>	71.82158189429983
<SOS> cried the host ; `` where is the monk ? '' <EOS>	60.89835649733057
<SOS> grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard . <EOS>	43.30253056522097
<SOS> `` he has escaped by this means , '' exclaimed he . <EOS>	61.85811360613735
<SOS> `` do you think so ? '' <EOS>	74.16737880482209
<SOS> said the host , bewildered ; `` boy , see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable . '' <EOS>	91.40491006300198
<SOS> `` there is no mule , '' cried he to whom this question was addressed . <EOS>	47.7632806767136
<SOS> the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously , whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man , whose worn , hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past . <EOS>	92.52736959903434
<SOS> `` there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself , '' said he . <EOS>	95.15740446314688
<SOS> `` does he still live ? '' <EOS>	93.52595784417827
<SOS> inquired the innkeeper . <EOS>	75.93751913077762
<SOS> making no reply , grimaud opened the poor man 's jacket to feel if the heart beat , whilst the host approached in his turn ; but in a moment they both fell back , the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid . <EOS>	64.51226768283718
<SOS> the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner . <EOS>	57.76611669363824
<SOS> `` run ! <EOS>	83.28305932901536
<SOS> run for help ! '' <EOS>	87.30480737731932
<SOS> cried grimaud , `` and i will remain beside him here . '' <EOS>	88.05343673045057
<SOS> the host quitted the room in agitation , and as for his wife , she had fled at the sound of her husband 's cries . <EOS>	61.27719803785753
<SOS> chapter xxxii . <EOS>	62.09382801941773
<SOS> the absolution . <EOS>	69.83260508272134
<SOS> this is what had taken place : we have seen that it was not of his own free will , but , on the contrary , very reluctantly , that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner . <EOS>	63.780102533858276
<SOS> perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so . <EOS>	57.10083972219926
<SOS> he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants , who doubtless had received their instructions . <EOS>	89.67631468456209
<SOS> and besides , he considered it most expedient , without exhibiting too much ill will , to follow to the end his role as confessor . <EOS>	88.04080821305654
<SOS> the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man . <EOS>	74.19500605943067
<SOS> the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose . <EOS>	96.34063113652692
<SOS> he made a movement of surprise and said : `` father , you are very young . '' <EOS>	74.3089199732567
<SOS> `` men who bear my robe have no age , '' replied the monk , dryly . <EOS>	64.84387422675522
<SOS> `` alas , speak to me more gently , father ; in my last moments i need a friend . '' <EOS>	75.42129205081183
<SOS> `` do you suffer much ? '' <EOS>	84.43800946905561
<SOS> asked the monk . <EOS>	63.640574509602864
<SOS> `` yes , but in my soul much more than in my body . '' <EOS>	59.46098946625984
<SOS> `` we will save your soul , '' said the young man ; `` but are you really the executioner of bethune , as these people say ? '' <EOS>	111.51470341124852
<SOS> `` that is to say , '' eagerly replied the wounded man , who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim `` that is to say , i was , but am no longer ; it is fifteen years since i gave up the office . <EOS>	54.82637331863448
<SOS> i still assist at executions , but no longer strike the blow myself no , indeed . '' <EOS>	61.526421770580214
<SOS> `` you have , then , a repugnance to your profession ? '' <EOS>	57.33043043763274
<SOS> `` so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly , sheltered as i was by justice and law ; but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god 's creatures since that day `` the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair . <EOS>	91.105666664123
<SOS> `` tell me about it , '' said the monk , who , sitting on the foot of the bed , began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced . <EOS>	79.26107519582776
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	109.34869492586132
<SOS> cried the dying man , with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression , `` ah ! <EOS>	68.13131240816162
<SOS> i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds ; i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood ; on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger , and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away . <EOS>	88.00170884719147
<SOS> that is not all ; the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor ; i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me . <EOS>	51.969335082880136
<SOS> all have forgiven me , some have even loved me ; but i think that god has not pardoned me , for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman 's ghost rising before me . '' <EOS>	113.59277890152512
<SOS> `` a woman ! <EOS>	68.85466364340844
<SOS> you have assassinated a woman , then ? '' <EOS>	87.433339361944
<SOS> cried the monk . <EOS>	62.70961031547835
<SOS> `` you also ! '' <EOS>	76.05374932148538
<SOS> exclaimed the executioner , `` you use that word which sounds ever in my ears 'assassinated ! ' <EOS>	80.19788338435707
<SOS> i have assassinated , then , and not executed ! <EOS>	74.70159821191925
<SOS> i am an assassin , then , and not an officer of justice ! '' <EOS>	105.2692971292607
<SOS> and he closed his eyes with a groan . <EOS>	68.36088854076466
<SOS> the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : `` go on , i know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , god and i will judge . '' <EOS>	50.09737963238192
<SOS> `` oh , father , '' continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , `` it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river , that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , 'place for the justice of god ! ' '' <EOS>	107.8351677174957
<SOS> `` delirium ! '' <EOS>	95.26954817275738
<SOS> murmured the monk , shaking his head . <EOS>	70.47680944533495
<SOS> the executioner opened his eyes , turned toward the young man and grasped his arm . <EOS>	76.93100806138291
<SOS> `` 'delirium , ' '' he repeated ; `` 'delirium , ' do you say ? <EOS>	88.54006174224186
<SOS> oh , no ! <EOS>	71.15520074117504
<SOS> i remember too well . <EOS>	63.83671717278798
<SOS> it was evening ; i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced . <EOS>	53.33371253309271
<SOS> after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god . '' <EOS>	85.61601385848076
<SOS> `` but let me see , how was it done ? <EOS>	80.85408615947696
<SOS> speak , '' said the monk . <EOS>	102.66760288982204
<SOS> `` it was at night . <EOS>	85.27340215474807
<SOS> a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him . <EOS>	59.26191612393294
<SOS> four other noblemen awaited me . <EOS>	47.29888627160929

<SOS> i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust . <EOS>	69.19641313402508
<SOS> we traveled five or six leagues , serious , silent , and almost without speaking . <EOS>	101.43967034186056
<SOS> at length , through the window of a little hut , they showed me a woman sitting , leaning on a table , and said , 'there is the person to be executed . ' '' <EOS>	115.17937150692549
<SOS> `` horrible ! '' <EOS>	83.4430293922269
<SOS> said the monk . <EOS>	55.64384645410485
<SOS> `` and you obeyed ? '' <EOS>	67.08750031701389
<SOS> `` father , that woman was a monster . <EOS>	73.64009433415556
<SOS> it was said that she had poisoned her second husband ; she had tried to assassinate her brother in law ; she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival , and before leaving england she had , it was believed , caused the favorite of the king to be murdered . '' <EOS>	67.46386515530985
<SOS> `` buckingham ? '' <EOS>	72.81490106570394

<SOS> `` yes , buckingham . '' <EOS>	84.30055762026723
<SOS> `` the woman was english , then ? '' <EOS>	71.29322512792456
<SOS> `` no , she was french , but she had married in england . '' <EOS>	91.4366070839036
<SOS> the monk turned pale , wiped his brow and went and bolted the door . <EOS>	40.65082298992877
<SOS> the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back , groaning , upon his bed . <EOS>	66.55323746532642
<SOS> `` no , no ; i am here , '' said the monk , quickly coming back to him . <EOS>	62.47207255111021
<SOS> `` go on ; who were those men ? '' <EOS>	114.76571470694543
<SOS> `` one of them was a foreigner , english , i think . <EOS>	106.15859071404599

<SOS> `` their names ? '' <EOS>	78.65565857765158
<SOS> asked the monk . <EOS>	62.129633825089
<SOS> `` i do n't know them , but the four other noblemen called the englishman 'my lord . ' '' <EOS>	57.76396529989754

<SOS> i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful , with a face so pale . '' <EOS>	62.86070296869049
<SOS> the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion ; he trembled all over ; he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask . <EOS>	88.5013082356807
<SOS> at length , with a violent effort at self control : `` the name of that woman ? '' <EOS>	72.76691244302882
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	58.68965002787175
<SOS> `` i do n't know what it was . <EOS>	40.186113565500584

<SOS> `` oh , pardon me , pardon me ! '' <EOS>	51.51400591465214

<SOS> and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man , saying , `` here is my absolution ! '' <EOS>	53.23758838493232
<SOS> then was heard that second cry , not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan . <EOS>	68.13725244503907
<SOS> the executioner , who had lifted himself up , fell back upon his bed . <EOS>	61.96802850339807
<SOS> as to the monk , without withdrawing the poniard from the wound , he ran to the window , opened it , leaped out into the flowers of a small garden , glided onward to the stable , took out his mule , went out by a back gate , ran to a neighbouring thicket , threw off his monkish garb , took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier , clothed himself in it , went on foot to the first post , secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris . <EOS>	58.0675601707101

<SOS> `` under what circumstances did we meet ? '' <EOS>	54.349978802815016

<SOS> `` yes , '' said the executioner . <EOS>	77.40639834695325

<SOS> `` what are you going to do ? '' <EOS>	58.45243988930054

<SOS> `` she was his mother . '' <EOS>	48.94576259408164
<SOS> grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner . <EOS>	98.47916223504382
<SOS> `` his mother ! '' <EOS>	42.51452833459154
<SOS> he repeated . <EOS>	53.050383133563074
<SOS> `` yes , his mother . '' <EOS>	78.87112056932776
<SOS> `` but does he know this secret , then ? '' <EOS>	46.70716642690717

<SOS> `` unhappy man ! '' <EOS>	45.46690685413782
<SOS> cried grimaud , whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause ; `` unhappy man , you named no one , i hope ? '' <EOS>	55.607579880679644
<SOS> `` i pronounced no name , for i knew none , except his mother 's , as a young girl , and it was by this name that he recognized her , but he knows that his uncle was among her judges . '' <EOS>	83.99805892074683
<SOS> thus speaking , he fell back exhausted . <EOS>	77.37606453236963
<SOS> grimaud , wishing to relieve him , advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger . <EOS>	83.40486072848309
<SOS> `` touch me not ! '' <EOS>	92.65252520405534
<SOS> said the executioner ; `` if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die . '' <EOS>	80.05336299592348
<SOS> grimaud remained with his hand extended ; then , striking his forehead , he exclaimed : `` oh ! <EOS>	63.545567384516175
<SOS> if this man should ever discover the names of the others , my master is lost . '' <EOS>	115.45266659438293
<SOS> `` haste ! <EOS>	103.12681316221028

<SOS> my death , believe me , will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure . '' <EOS>	94.00122525419452
<SOS> `` where was the monk going ? '' <EOS>	57.89354630910401
<SOS> asked grimaud . <EOS>	99.86732777558723
<SOS> `` toward paris . '' <EOS>	103.52890070526068
<SOS> `` who stopped him ? '' <EOS>	55.670503053067904
<SOS> `` two young gentlemen , who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne . '' <EOS>	54.7199250181321
<SOS> `` and it was this young man who brought the monk to you ? <EOS>	70.09940174484606
<SOS> then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful , '' continued grimaud . <EOS>	57.98600833164578
<SOS> `` and yet that woman deserved her fate ; do you not think so ? '' <EOS>	89.57957122086141
<SOS> `` on one 's death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one 's own , '' said the executioner ; and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes . <EOS>	67.26283383653859
<SOS> grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere . <EOS>	86.87505231049184
<SOS> whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room , followed not only by a surgeon , but by many other persons , whom curiosity had attracted to the spot . <EOS>	79.43348215389267
<SOS> the surgeon approached the dying man , who seemed to have fainted . <EOS>	67.84621879483697
<SOS> `` we must first extract the steel from the side , '' said he , shaking his head in a significant manner . <EOS>	81.902154584392
<SOS> the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud , who turned away his head . <EOS>	71.24545329354535
<SOS> the weapon , as we have already stated , was plunged into the body to the hilt , and as the surgeon , taking it by the end , drew it forth , the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful . <EOS>	63.50850852771367
<SOS> when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn , a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath ; then , fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression , the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired . <EOS>	84.5179967888746
<SOS> then grimaud , lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room , to the horror of all present , made a sign to the host to follow him , paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse . <EOS>	65.37461588619568
<SOS> grimaud 's first intention had been to return to paris , but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul , and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour 's riding would unite them , and that the going , returning and explanation would not occupy an hour , he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe . <EOS>	43.845498715393745
<SOS> raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor , when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself , travel stained , dirty , and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner . <EOS>	41.83444070826042
<SOS> `` grimaud , my good grimaud ! '' <EOS>	73.26636999573446
<SOS> exclaimed raoul `` here you are at last ! <EOS>	64.03335560226208
<SOS> excuse me , sirs , this is not a servant , but a friend . <EOS>	95.98597971220767
<SOS> how did you leave the count ? '' <EOS>	80.00482748841603
<SOS> continued he . <EOS>	85.10484348701513
<SOS> `` does he regret me a little ? <EOS>	59.55266864244896
<SOS> have you seen him since i left him ? <EOS>	52.35523668027951
<SOS> answer , for i have many things to tell you , too ; indeed , the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter ? <EOS>	57.7850902186985
<SOS> how pale you are ! <EOS>	77.8002311483268
<SOS> and blood , too ! <EOS>	103.39762696786397
<SOS> what is this ? '' <EOS>	59.015664988199184
<SOS> `` it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms . '' <EOS>	96.79887702182094
<SOS> `` in your arms ? <EOS>	43.2154750927405
<SOS> that man ! <EOS>	68.65902120458061
<SOS> but know you who he was ? '' <EOS>	80.57247864090164
<SOS> `` he used to be the headsman of bethune . '' <EOS>	64.95447619235777
<SOS> `` you knew him ? <EOS>	101.67643598665565

<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	96.98044662721368
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said d'arminges , `` it is the common lot ; even an executioner is not exempted . <EOS>	57.41013312802729
<SOS> i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound , and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion , too , that death would follow . '' <EOS>	108.02837451952679
<SOS> at the mention of the monk , grimaud became pale . <EOS>	72.28635240474333
<SOS> `` come , come , '' continued d'arminges , `` to dinner ; '' for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast . <EOS>	76.47577881799077
<SOS> `` you are right , sir , '' said raoul . <EOS>	51.66431727206979
<SOS> `` come , grimaud , order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk . '' <EOS>	48.48819820514495
<SOS> `` no , sir , no , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	76.70627708959337
<SOS> `` i can not stop a moment ; i must start for paris again immediately . '' <EOS>	71.88267698453295
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	107.50190902906066
<SOS> you start for paris ? <EOS>	72.5906649538669
<SOS> you are mistaken ; it is olivain who leaves me ; you are to remain . '' <EOS>	81.06777647263044
<SOS> `` on the contrary , olivain is to stay and i am to go . <EOS>	72.67980997202012
<SOS> i have come for nothing else but to tell you so . '' <EOS>	100.90879748876652
<SOS> `` but what is the meaning of this change ? '' <EOS>	86.58921630636354
<SOS> `` i can not tell you . '' <EOS>	60.473733191303545
<SOS> `` explain yourself . '' <EOS>	59.99113928447641

<SOS> `` come , tell me , what is the joke ? '' <EOS>	74.68053023975556
<SOS> `` monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke . '' <EOS>	65.59750265143474
<SOS> `` yes , but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that olivain should return to paris . <EOS>	53.08619819660237
<SOS> i shall follow the count 's directions . '' <EOS>	86.57398589782346
<SOS> `` not under present circumstances , monsieur . '' <EOS>	92.3559714366666
<SOS> `` perhaps you mean to disobey me ? '' <EOS>	90.50846327332451
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , i must . '' <EOS>	59.73000378430921
<SOS> `` you persist , then ? '' <EOS>	104.51488815629278
<SOS> `` yes , i am going ; may you be happy , monsieur , '' and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out . <EOS>	94.31213744737703
<SOS> raoul , angry and at the same time uneasy , ran after him and seized him by the arm . <EOS>	66.4880352537517
<SOS> `` grimaud ! '' <EOS>	58.66115208368236
<SOS> he cried ; `` remain ; i wish it . '' <EOS>	51.15148184367086
<SOS> `` then , '' replied grimaud , `` you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed . '' <EOS>	83.98129244825957
<SOS> he saluted and made a movement to depart . <EOS>	78.41375280144045
<SOS> `` grimaud , my friend , '' said the viscount , `` will you leave me thus , in such anxiety ? <EOS>	66.19129159935659
<SOS> speak , speak , in heaven 's name ! '' <EOS>	92.51007328862205
<SOS> and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair . <EOS>	69.35003106806514
<SOS> `` i can tell you but one thing , sir , for the secret you wish to know is not my own . <EOS>	68.36814577812353
<SOS> you met a monk , did you not ? '' <EOS>	87.86552616997095
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	67.36270214893999
<SOS> the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear . <EOS>	66.67092668944254
<SOS> `` you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him , and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him . '' <EOS>	60.83705444755438
<SOS> `` yes , yes ! '' <EOS>	45.757957924286444
<SOS> cried both young men . <EOS>	53.06925796829249
<SOS> `` very well ; if ever you meet him again , wherever it may be , whether on the high road or in the street or in a church , anywhere that he or you may be , put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity , without mercy , as you would crush a viper or a scorpion ! <EOS>	64.75095481359564
<SOS> destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead ; the lives of five men are not safe , in my opinion , as long as he is on the earth . '' <EOS>	78.01211211408146
<SOS> and without adding another word , grimaud , profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors , rushed from the room . <EOS>	40.129636193458815
<SOS> two minutes later the thunder of a horse 's hoofs was heard upon the road ; it was grimaud , on his way to paris . <EOS>	72.13562739495283
<SOS> when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things ; first , that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles , and secondly , that he had no money . <EOS>	52.70274140998199
<SOS> but grimaud 's ingenuity was more prolific than his speech , and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses . <EOS>	86.20981568499377
<SOS> chapter xxxiv . <EOS>	73.07704096902256
<SOS> on the eve of battle . <EOS>	67.5108563421632
<SOS> raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host , who rushed into the apartment crying out , `` the spaniards ! <EOS>	97.48127556692894
<SOS> the spaniards ! '' <EOS>	50.25307443324324
<SOS> that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation . <EOS>	49.25079501821153
<SOS> the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of houdin and bethune . <EOS>	79.10059809444064
<SOS> while monsieur d'arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure , the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry . <EOS>	112.08035025971276
<SOS> this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans ; it was an entire army . <EOS>	40.11818705112238
<SOS> there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d'arminges and beat a retreat . <EOS>	52.155115921948955
<SOS> they quickly went downstairs . <EOS>	110.35268942356117
<SOS> monsieur d'arminges was already mounted . <EOS>	85.89608905905973
<SOS> olivain had ready the horses of the young men , and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner , mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use . <EOS>	52.45543954515858
<SOS> as a further precaution they had bound his hands . <EOS>	59.84662580150347
<SOS> the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin , where they expected to find the prince . <EOS>	57.66894521105699
<SOS> but he was no longer there , having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee , misled by false intelligence of the enemy 's movements . <EOS>	90.58051992782451
<SOS> deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie ; and after a reconnoissance along the entire line , in company with marshal de grammont , he had returned and seated himself before a table , with his officers around him . <EOS>	113.85499193846935
<SOS> he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain , but nothing positive had been learned . <EOS>	59.922885672936495
<SOS> the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence . <EOS>	41.83296742605146
<SOS> now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening , as when he has completely disappeared . <EOS>	95.30468538938352
<SOS> the prince was , therefore , contrary to his custom , gloomy and anxious , when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him . <EOS>	72.253948181796
<SOS> the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out . <EOS>	90.61196137104598
<SOS> the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door ; no one ventured to speak , for fear of disturbing him . <EOS>	104.96906112571175
<SOS> suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard . <EOS>	61.273658181592474
<SOS> the prince leaped to his feet , extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound , there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon . <EOS>	65.06578575263089
<SOS> every one stood up . <EOS>	86.93023536528432
<SOS> at that moment the door opened . <EOS>	59.11515813391565
<SOS> `` monseigneur , '' said marshal de grammont , with a radiant face , `` will your highness permit my son , count de guiche , and his traveling companion , viscount de bragelonne , to come in and give news of the enemy , whom they have found while we were looking for him ? '' <EOS>	52.116656193661626
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	61.990989840822195
<SOS> eagerly replied the prince , `` will i permit ? <EOS>	69.52979321071128
<SOS> i not only permit , i desire ; let them come in . '' <EOS>	91.12106081421472
<SOS> the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince . <EOS>	83.22981934169499
<SOS> `` speak , gentlemen , '' said the prince , saluting them ; `` first speak ; we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments . <EOS>	72.76111574541484
<SOS> the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing . '' <EOS>	80.95076219291772
<SOS> it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply ; not only was he the elder , but he had been presented to the prince by his father . <EOS>	70.23123268484434
<SOS> besides , he had long known the prince , whilst raoul now saw him for the first time . <EOS>	101.50387438407553
<SOS> he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe . <EOS>	75.38521981478029
<SOS> meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general , already made so famous by the battles of rocroy , fribourg , and nordlingen . <EOS>	69.86050254728607
<SOS> louis de bourbon , prince de condé , who , since the death of his father , henri de bourbon , was called , in accordance with the custom of that period , monsieur le prince , was a young man , not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old , with the eye of an eagle agl ' occhi grifani , as dante says aquiline nose , long , waving hair , of medium height , well formed , possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say , the rapid glance , quick decision , fabulous courage . <EOS>	57.97763224686163
<SOS> at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind , so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war , by his new contributions to its methods , he had also made a revolution at paris , among the young noblemen of the court , whose natural chief he was and who , in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court , modeled after bassompierre , bellegarde and the duke d'angouleme , were called the petits maitres . <EOS>	58.85386944855088
<SOS> at the first words of the count de guiche , the prince , having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon , had understood everything . <EOS>	95.14415536024534
<SOS> the enemy was marching upon lens , with the intention , doubtless , of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france . <EOS>	69.52739794616829
<SOS> but in what force was the enemy ? <EOS>	54.4421450662454
<SOS> was it a corps sent out to make a diversion ? <EOS>	55.68633246838777
<SOS> was it an entire army ? <EOS>	81.20813988024926
<SOS> to this question de guiche could not respond . <EOS>	85.10123376064666
<SOS> now , as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence , it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer , exact , precise , positive . <EOS>	93.16483327028281
<SOS> raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince : `` my lord , '' he said , `` will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject , which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty ? '' <EOS>	99.28726112523653
<SOS> the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance ; he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old . <EOS>	64.73510908864873
<SOS> `` certainly , monsieur , speak , '' he said , softening his stern , accented tones , as if he were speaking to a woman . <EOS>	67.95839941174421
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said raoul , blushing , `` might examine the spanish prisoner . '' <EOS>	73.2872991081503
<SOS> `` have you a spanish prisoner ? '' <EOS>	73.22768039412918
<SOS> cried the prince . <EOS>	63.09854067653976
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	88.23585694638706
<SOS> `` ah , that is true , '' said de guiche ; `` i had forgotten it . '' <EOS>	104.43313032267409
<SOS> `` that is easily understood ; it was you who took him , count , '' said raoul , smiling . <EOS>	105.54627111647915
<SOS> the old marshal turned toward the viscount , grateful for that praise of his son , whilst the prince exclaimed : `` the young man is right ; let the prisoner be brought in . '' <EOS>	59.129434025667884
<SOS> meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was . <EOS>	83.82604045626464
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said the prince , turning toward raoul , `` i know that you have a letter from my sister , madame de longueville ; but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel . '' <EOS>	84.99723533375132
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said raoul , coloring up , `` i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count . <EOS>	65.89356044354774
<SOS> but here is the letter . '' <EOS>	75.34107663866627
<SOS> `` very well , '' said the prince ; `` give it to me later . <EOS>	116.27918092825061
<SOS> here is the prisoner ; let us attend to what is most pressing . '' <EOS>	60.49539668479681
<SOS> the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy , and grew old in stratagems and spoils . <EOS>	75.21376202799681
<SOS> since he had been taken he had not uttered a word , so that it was not known to what country he belonged . <EOS>	61.9206449669356
<SOS> the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust . <EOS>	80.68335219454151
<SOS> `` of what country are you ? '' <EOS>	64.08539132129856
<SOS> asked the prince . <EOS>	70.40425860786648
<SOS> the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue . <EOS>	100.06546274047096
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	80.42006633513552
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	49.8589101944261
<SOS> it seems that he is a spaniard . <EOS>	83.45154679372477
<SOS> do you speak spanish , grammont ? '' <EOS>	89.14353036900621
<SOS> `` faith , my lord , but indifferently . '' <EOS>	50.37505487586134
<SOS> `` and i not at all , '' said the prince , laughing . <EOS>	77.06642199004374
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , turning to those who were near him `` can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter ? '' <EOS>	84.36299542762231
<SOS> `` i can , my lord , '' said raoul . <EOS>	65.50933422443686
<SOS> `` ah , you speak spanish ? '' <EOS>	69.15251966341894
<SOS> `` enough , i think , to fulfill your highness 's wishes on this occasion . '' <EOS>	92.74873727569432
<SOS> meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place . <EOS>	72.91616923455447
<SOS> `` my lord asks of what country you are , '' said the young man , in the purest castilian . <EOS>	40.62603336742433
<SOS> `` ich bin ein deutscher , '' replied the prisoner . <EOS>	63.0903624246819
<SOS> `` what in the devil does he say ? '' <EOS>	70.5000338251962
<SOS> asked the prince . <EOS>	82.19726060276855
<SOS> `` what new gibberish is that ? '' <EOS>	80.06671949091968
<SOS> `` he says he is german , my lord , '' replied raoul ; `` but i doubt it , for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective . '' <EOS>	95.22649696822236
<SOS> `` then you speak german , also ? '' <EOS>	59.560132154933896
<SOS> asked the prince . <EOS>	61.26782948307768
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	99.96736676222318
<SOS> `` well enough to question him in that language ? '' <EOS>	84.77547561451048
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	74.5182961349683
<SOS> `` question him , then . '' <EOS>	82.99821858966511
<SOS> raoul began the examination , but the result justified his opinion . <EOS>	94.22782045476616
<SOS> the prisoner did not understand , or seemed not to understand , what raoul said to him ; and raoul could hardly understand his replies , containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian . <EOS>	64.21846219789524
<SOS> however , amidst all the prisoner 's efforts to elude a systematic examination , raoul had recognized his natural accent . <EOS>	58.11975217131038
<SOS> `` non siete spagnuolo , '' he said ; `` non siete tedesco ; siete italiano . '' <EOS>	93.7822198595441
<SOS> the prisoner started and bit his lips . <EOS>	98.9666371777112
<SOS> `` ah , that , '' said the prince , `` i understand that language thoroughly ; and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination . <EOS>	94.15892080349622
<SOS> thank you , viscount , '' continued the prince , laughing , `` and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter . '' <EOS>	90.4090192592156
<SOS> but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages ; his aim was to elude the examination . <EOS>	86.95757752698212
<SOS> therefore , he knew nothing either of the enemy 's numbers , or of those in command , or of the purpose of the army . <EOS>	77.76166758204339
<SOS> `` very good , '' said the prince , understanding the reason of that ignorance ; `` the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery ; he might have purchased his life by speaking ; he does n't wish to speak . <EOS>	56.37417719663294
<SOS> take him out and shoot him . '' <EOS>	59.204376162248096
<SOS> the prisoner turned pale . <EOS>	78.25438180236303
<SOS> the two soldiers who had brought him in took him , each by one arm , and led him toward the door , whilst the prince , turning to marshal de grammont , seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given . <EOS>	90.16068251548711
<SOS> when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped . <EOS>	60.02468267053278
<SOS> the soldiers , who knew only their orders , attempted to force him along . <EOS>	95.08482708126874
<SOS> `` one moment , '' said the prisoner , in french . <EOS>	70.60684680198808
<SOS> `` i am ready to speak , my lord . '' <EOS>	113.60704451024355
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	95.85985432745714
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	102.61811915503758
<SOS> said the prince , laughing , `` i thought we should come to that . <EOS>	86.63356366719414
<SOS> i have a sure method of limbering tongues . <EOS>	46.68546425397835
<SOS> young men , take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command . '' <EOS>	69.80974015545998
<SOS> `` but on condition , '' continued the prisoner , `` that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe . '' <EOS>	77.64115021138862
<SOS> `` upon my honor , '' said the prince . <EOS>	57.09686009726447
<SOS> `` question , then , my lord . '' <EOS>	83.15597224091518
<SOS> `` where did the army cross the lys ? '' <EOS>	98.04429908838104
<SOS> `` between saint venant and aire . '' <EOS>	90.23844050542579
<SOS> `` by whom is it commanded ? '' <EOS>	82.05105518823348
<SOS> `` by count de fuonsaldagna , general beck and the archduke . '' <EOS>	64.40722051311518
<SOS> `` of how many does it consist ? '' <EOS>	67.9376561689059
<SOS> `` eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon . '' <EOS>	72.61513743879127
<SOS> `` and its aim is ? '' <EOS>	78.8790364074854
<SOS> `` lens . '' <EOS>	83.40318699619621
<SOS> `` you see ; gentlemen ! '' <EOS>	90.16911514374888
<SOS> said the prince , turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers . <EOS>	51.19687678013288
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , '' said the marshal , `` you have divined all that was possible to human genius . '' <EOS>	61.22888274493332
<SOS> `` recall le plessis , bellievre , villequier and d'erlac , '' said the prince , `` recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys . <EOS>	45.84939288124978
<SOS> let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night . <EOS>	74.23518435602952
<SOS> to morrow , according to all probability , we shall attack the enemy . '' <EOS>	48.67656739679201
<SOS> `` but , my lord , '' said marshal de grammont , `` consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men . '' <EOS>	54.936753757631145
<SOS> `` monsieur le marechal , '' said the prince , with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him , `` it is with small armies that great battles are won . '' <EOS>	87.70101078219928
<SOS> then turning toward the prisoner , `` take away that man , '' he said , `` and keep him carefully in sight . <EOS>	65.93677654104978
<SOS> his life is dependent on the information he has given us ; if it is true , he shall be free ; if false , let him be shot . '' <EOS>	60.15666224539324
<SOS> the prisoner was led away . <EOS>	63.47051907871808
<SOS> `` count de guiche , '' said the prince , `` it is a long time since you saw your father , remain here with him . <EOS>	80.44005807322337
<SOS> monsieur , '' he continued , addressing raoul , `` if you are not too tired , follow me . '' <EOS>	73.28992012608047
<SOS> `` to the end of the world , my lord ! '' <EOS>	64.89236802730896
<SOS> cried raoul , feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general , who seemed to him so worthy of his renown . <EOS>	91.08644138701143
<SOS> the prince smiled ; he despised flatterers , but he appreciated enthusiasts . <EOS>	79.4313283897652
<SOS> `` come , monsieur , '' he said , `` you are good in council , as we have already discovered ; to morrow we shall know if you are good in action . '' <EOS>	76.44533549128687
<SOS> `` and i , '' said the marshal , `` what am i to do ? '' <EOS>	58.06847721647857
<SOS> `` wait here to receive the troops . <EOS>	84.19825153738938
<SOS> i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me . <EOS>	63.56602291446007
<SOS> twenty guards , well mounted , are all that i shall need for my escort . '' <EOS>	44.551909156541264
<SOS> `` that is very few , '' said the marshal . <EOS>	71.76820990865386
<SOS> `` it is enough , '' replied the prince . <EOS>	69.01292464152873
<SOS> `` have you a good horse , monsieur de bragelonne ? '' <EOS>	61.100199993886484
<SOS> `` my horse was killed this morning , my lord , and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey 's . '' <EOS>	58.07958034875171
<SOS> `` choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best . <EOS>	77.75387485498699
<SOS> no false modesty ; take the best horse you can find . <EOS>	72.35549322367788
<SOS> you will need it this evening , perhaps ; you will certainly need it to morrow . '' <EOS>	71.75216118999593
<SOS> raoul did n't wait to be told twice ; he knew that with superiors , especially when those superiors are princes , the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument ; he went down to the stables , picked out a pie bald andalusian horse , saddled and bridled it himself , for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger , and went to rejoin the prince , who at that moment mounted his horse . <EOS>	58.94544122503537
<SOS> `` now , monsieur , '' he said to raoul , `` will you give me the letter you have brought ? '' <EOS>	75.58363398207183
<SOS> raoul handed the letter to the prince . <EOS>	96.12626789427131
<SOS> `` keep near me , '' said the latter . <EOS>	64.38963547879224
<SOS> the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle , as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free , unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens , attended by raoul and his small escort , whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions . <EOS>	98.74752549952203
<SOS> the prince read as he hastened on . <EOS>	51.5090075341073
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' he said , after a moment , `` they tell me great things of you . <EOS>	60.929325818390716
<SOS> i have only to say , after the little that i have seen and heard , that i think even better of you than i have been told . '' <EOS>	107.28026452689113
<SOS> raoul bowed . <EOS>	76.38843320395763
<SOS> meanwhile , as the little troop drew nearer to lens , the noise of the cannon sounded louder . <EOS>	103.46751309052419
<SOS> the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey . <EOS>	77.84416136392448
<SOS> one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon . <EOS>	116.67249750982727
<SOS> from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder , and he panted like a horse . <EOS>	87.75965246135777
<SOS> at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle , and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay . <EOS>	83.59383259166752
<SOS> the peasants were in great commotion . <EOS>	65.49390707694289
<SOS> the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened . <EOS>	64.33075086070598
<SOS> the women had already fled , taking refuge in vitry ; only a few men remained . <EOS>	85.26659194855132
<SOS> on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him . <EOS>	58.26021408369743
<SOS> one of them recognized him . <EOS>	112.50050073644745
<SOS> `` ah , my lord , '' he said , `` have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers ? '' <EOS>	102.879446595506
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the prince , `` if you will serve me as guide . '' <EOS>	98.15700502151292
<SOS> `` willingly , my lord . <EOS>	97.07687612877152
<SOS> where does your highness wish to go ? '' <EOS>	82.49307427505217
<SOS> `` to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country `` `` in that case , i 'm your man . '' <EOS>	54.94883686436005
<SOS> `` i can trust you you are a true frenchman ? '' <EOS>	89.59357539644635
<SOS> `` i am an old soldier of rocroy , my lord . '' <EOS>	76.90714911578483
<SOS> `` here , '' said the prince , handing him a purse , `` here is for rocroy . <EOS>	85.05117141150022
<SOS> now , do you want a horse , or will you go afoot ? '' <EOS>	41.455632092147
<SOS> `` afoot , my lord ; i have served always in the infantry . <EOS>	84.86570366434032
<SOS> besides , i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk . '' <EOS>	74.62366413117729
<SOS> `` come , then , '' said the prince ; `` let us lose no time . '' <EOS>	74.34364614982596
<SOS> the peasant started off , running before the prince 's horse ; then , a hundred steps from the village , he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley . <EOS>	100.31498610770278
<SOS> for a half league they proceeded thus , the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls . <EOS>	57.50396205281743
<SOS> at length they entered a path which , going out from the road , skirted the mountainside . <EOS>	80.03400454728524
<SOS> the prince dismounted , ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example , and directed the others to await his orders , keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert . <EOS>	81.7965463155271
<SOS> he then began to ascend the path . <EOS>	82.14199255382346
<SOS> in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau ; those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country . <EOS>	67.19266187301737
<SOS> at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens , at bay , and before lens the enemy 's entire army . <EOS>	65.25260288157945
<SOS> with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him , from lens as far as vimy . <EOS>	100.03294570130495
<SOS> in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind . <EOS>	74.5247087488418
<SOS> he took a pencil , tore a page from his tablets and wrote : `` my dear marshal , in an hour lens will be in the enemy 's possession . <EOS>	77.45808388578632
<SOS> come and rejoin me ; bring with you the whole army . <EOS>	108.39162195519147
<SOS> i shall be at vendin to place it in position . <EOS>	95.6028624614382
<SOS> to morrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy . '' <EOS>	49.476772344796956
<SOS> then , turning toward raoul : `` go , monsieur , '' he said ; `` ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de grammont . '' <EOS>	101.40624920327565
<SOS> raoul bowed , took the letter , went hastily down the mountain , leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop . <EOS>	76.93702875806243
<SOS> a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal . <EOS>	69.8680527403943
<SOS> a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment . <EOS>	45.207898876780625
<SOS> marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin , leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest . <EOS>	59.0187981673898
<SOS> all the artillery was ready to move , and started off at a moment 's notice . <EOS>	92.63392824125415
<SOS> it was seven o'clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place . <EOS>	63.61724137206913
<SOS> the prince awaited him there . <EOS>	84.90926266963416
<SOS> as he had foreseen , lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul 's departure . <EOS>	93.1301939948388
<SOS> the event was announced by the cessation of the firing . <EOS>	106.13953358948376
<SOS> as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments . <EOS>	72.80653304291408
<SOS> orders were given that no drum should be beaten , no trumpet sounded . <EOS>	55.043405722820765
<SOS> at nine o'clock the night had fully come . <EOS>	65.5932712797698
<SOS> still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain . <EOS>	71.24653759385215
<SOS> the army marched silently , the prince at the head of the column . <EOS>	62.30126023302557
<SOS> presently the army came in sight of lens ; two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault . <EOS>	71.71989992617075
<SOS> the prince assigned to every one his post . <EOS>	47.48296127828351
<SOS> marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left , resting on mericourt . <EOS>	75.00547181463452
<SOS> the duc de chatillon commanded the centre . <EOS>	67.05045472785574
<SOS> finally , the prince led the right wing , resting on aunay . <EOS>	70.46391399688785
<SOS> the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening . <EOS>	99.61385165726877
<SOS> each one , on awaking , would find himself on the field of battle . <EOS>	41.796657235506096
<SOS> the movement was executed in silence and with precision . <EOS>	49.15638849179073
<SOS> at ten o'clock every one was in his appointed position ; at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day . <EOS>	68.08259356820604
<SOS> three things were especially urged upon the officers , who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously : the first , that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps ; the second , to go to the charge no faster than a walk ; the third , to let the enemy fire first . <EOS>	84.89114926443054
<SOS> the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person ; but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them . <EOS>	84.8074810677464
<SOS> a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal . <EOS>	58.58879869337565
<SOS> although the day had been fatiguing , neither of them was inclined to sleep . <EOS>	77.07978408423463
<SOS> and besides , even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time ; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle . <EOS>	92.03905922581274
<SOS> on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then ; those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers . <EOS>	65.79655538778441
<SOS> it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender , it reaches then , quite naturally , the highest exaltation of which it is capable . <EOS>	88.33124596230367
<SOS> some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends , for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write . <EOS>	92.20740491144902
<SOS> the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words . <EOS>	71.46844911625787
<SOS> the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled ; they understood without speaking , their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic . <EOS>	63.35047857087412
<SOS> the letters being finished , each put his own into two envelopes , so that no one , without tearing the first envelope , could discover to whom the second was addressed ; then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters . <EOS>	91.46663279363021
<SOS> `` in case any evil should happen to me , '' said bragelonne . <EOS>	77.63506985537958
<SOS> `` in case i should be killed , '' said de guiche . <EOS>	86.81453597263435
<SOS> they then embraced each other like two brothers , and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds , flowers and infants . <EOS>	77.44503394564171
<SOS> chapter xxxv . <EOS>	56.13688994319874
<SOS> a dinner in the old style . <EOS>	97.46015197658045
<SOS> the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first . <EOS>	75.29599908612272
<SOS> athos , with his superior understanding , wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion , and at the moment when his friends , in deference to his deportment and sobriety , dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners , he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables . <EOS>	68.93420546211125
<SOS> for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all , and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the rue de la monnaie , of the sign of the hermitage . <EOS>	62.964437819742216
<SOS> the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday , at eight o'clock in the evening precisely . <EOS>	101.43963248174441
<SOS> on that day , in fact , the four friends arrived punctually at the hour , each from his own abode or occupation . <EOS>	87.24552252593934
<SOS> porthos had been trying a new horse ; d'artagnan was on guard at the louvre ; aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood ; and athos , whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud , found himself close at hand . <EOS>	50.46660855127476
<SOS> they were , therefore , somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage , athos starting out from the pont neuf , porthos by the rue de la roule , d'artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l'auxerrois , and aramis by the rue de bethisy . <EOS>	63.24743048448846
<SOS> the first words exchanged between the four friends , on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration , were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness . <EOS>	92.58414780425196
<SOS> athos perceived this embarrassment , and by way of supplying an effectual remedy , called for four bottles of champagne . <EOS>	53.14037305874681
<SOS> at this order , given in athos 's habitually calm manner , the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos 's brow grew smooth . <EOS>	71.41924461046958
<SOS> aramis was astonished . <EOS>	48.21254612367016
<SOS> he knew that athos not only never drank , but more , that he had a kind of repugnance to wine . <EOS>	94.21496906394293
<SOS> this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm . <EOS>	89.44561633288455
<SOS> his companions followed his example . <EOS>	111.16356733229907
<SOS> in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits . <EOS>	52.965655300124354
<SOS> now the four friends began to speak loud , scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began , and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table . <EOS>	102.04025364604328
<SOS> soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet , seeing which , porthos unfastened his entirely . <EOS>	74.11295787553453
<SOS> battles , long journeys , blows given and received , sufficed for the first themes of conversation , which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal . <EOS>	51.95971528863404
<SOS> `` faith , '' said aramis , laughing , `` we have praised the dead enough , let us revile the living a little ; i should like to say something evil of mazarin ; is it permissible ? '' <EOS>	88.88260855765871
<SOS> `` go on , go on , '' replied d'artagnan , laughing heartily ; `` relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one . '' <EOS>	83.91751956263033
<SOS> `` a great prince , '' said aramis , `` with whom mazarin sought an alliance , was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him . <EOS>	63.16729275374397
<SOS> the prince , who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow , made out a list , against the grain , and sent it . <EOS>	54.17827773783951
<SOS> in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them . '' <EOS>	73.93589629905871
<SOS> `` ah , ha , ha ! '' <EOS>	40.26990105079411
<SOS> laughed the three friends , `` not a bad bargain ; and there was no fear of being taken at his word ; what did the prince do then ? '' <EOS>	78.4793356610815
<SOS> `` the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin , begging him never to write to him again , and offered twenty thousand francs more , on condition that he would never speak to him . <EOS>	65.39050225909178
<SOS> what did mazarin do ? '' <EOS>	66.74571727275439
<SOS> `` stormed ! '' <EOS>	76.99462936812344
<SOS> suggested athos . <EOS>	61.223930019040104
<SOS> `` beat the messenger ! '' <EOS>	80.02012495173558
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	70.74488217943932
<SOS> `` accepted the money ! '' <EOS>	99.47590660432886
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	60.141357574855036
<SOS> `` you have guessed it , '' answered aramis ; and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything ; he thought they were fighting . <EOS>	59.42852395244839
<SOS> at last their hilarity calmed down and : `` faith ! '' <EOS>	45.73461481756235
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan to the two friends , `` you may well wish ill to mazarin ; for i assure you , on his side he wishes you no good . '' <EOS>	96.45646254847756
<SOS> `` pooh ! <EOS>	72.72714930419498
<SOS> really ? '' <EOS>	72.36992826673138
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	45.4743606566963
<SOS> `` if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized , for fear it might be thought i knew him . '' <EOS>	61.72798090426214
<SOS> `` he knows you better by your actions than your name ; he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort , and he has instigated an active search for them , i can answer for it . '' <EOS>	59.243456928798444
<SOS> `` by whom ? '' <EOS>	68.89528336896119
<SOS> `` by me ; and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information . '' <EOS>	57.714036941504574
<SOS> `` and what did you reply ? '' <EOS>	55.109492427665586
<SOS> `` that i had none as yet ; but that i was to dine to day with two gentlemen , who would be able to give me some . '' <EOS>	41.671463142088044
<SOS> `` you told him that ? '' <EOS>	65.04516335817927
<SOS> said porthos , a broad smile spreading over his honest face . <EOS>	52.09135493937043
<SOS> `` bravo ! <EOS>	61.84114297072975
<SOS> and you are not afraid of that , athos ? '' <EOS>	63.88315485797552
<SOS> `` no , '' replied athos , `` it is not the search of mazarin that i fear . '' <EOS>	63.72532179872875
<SOS> `` now , '' said aramis , `` tell me a little what you do fear . '' <EOS>	104.2767318475924
<SOS> `` nothing for the present ; at least , nothing in good earnest . '' <EOS>	50.90910845680676
<SOS> `` and with regard to the past ? '' <EOS>	41.06508111807219
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	54.595761604804906
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	97.32398058649906
<SOS> the past is another thing , '' said athos , sighing ; `` the past and the future . '' <EOS>	52.669220093073655
<SOS> `` are you afraid for your young raoul ? '' <EOS>	59.45947848549469
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	50.33031139724408
<SOS> `` well , '' said d'artagnan , `` one is never killed in a first engagement . '' <EOS>	85.04939193448497
<SOS> `` nor in the second , '' said aramis `` nor in the third , '' returned porthos ; `` and even when one is killed , one rises again , the proof of which is , that here we are ! '' <EOS>	118.17419595828741
<SOS> `` no , '' said athos , `` it is not raoul about whom i am anxious , for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman ; and if he is killed well , he will die bravely ; but hold should such a misfortune happen well `` athos passed his hand across his pale brow . <EOS>	47.42368021295075
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	52.22054952438463
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	76.48430525660386
<SOS> `` well , i shall look upon it as an expiation . '' <EOS>	89.06128976873816
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	74.67724526921432
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` i know what you mean . '' <EOS>	80.2048590034101
<SOS> `` and i , too , '' added aramis ; `` but you must not think of that , athos ; what is past , is past . '' <EOS>	82.26012186620899
<SOS> `` i do n't understand , '' said porthos . <EOS>	65.81104624885612
<SOS> `` the affair at armentieres , '' whispered d'artagnan . <EOS>	96.929822155308
<SOS> `` the affair at armentieres ? '' <EOS>	83.18087208148077
<SOS> asked he again . <EOS>	64.54930860863253
<SOS> `` milady . '' <EOS>	43.10370755183221
<SOS> `` oh , yes ! '' <EOS>	62.02723496133975
<SOS> said porthos ; `` true , i had forgotten it ! '' <EOS>	79.53782679583307
<SOS> athos looked at him intently . <EOS>	103.88175155027551
<SOS> `` you have forgotten it , porthos ? '' <EOS>	87.42510208786135
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	103.40892344634761
<SOS> `` faith ! <EOS>	51.61900231462003
<SOS> yes , it is so long ago , '' answered porthos . <EOS>	73.18722577592823
<SOS> `` this affair does not , then , weigh upon your conscience ? '' <EOS>	80.64645587387275
<SOS> `` faith , no . '' <EOS>	49.51404334595075
<SOS> `` and you , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	76.32319395039771
<SOS> `` i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux . <EOS>	82.24151029891621
<SOS> yes , yes , '' murmured he , `` i have often felt regret for the victim , but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin . '' <EOS>	43.23509112125625
<SOS> athos shook his dead doubtfully . <EOS>	74.27450739993263
<SOS> `` consider , '' said aramis , `` if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world , that woman was punished by the will of heaven . <EOS>	82.45188383224261
<SOS> we were but the instruments , that is all . '' <EOS>	103.8078782828176
<SOS> `` but as to free will , aramis ? '' <EOS>	63.42299647378831
<SOS> `` how acts the judge ? <EOS>	88.03849763968333
<SOS> he has a free will , yet he fearlessly condemns . <EOS>	60.100856950885756
<SOS> what does the executioner ? <EOS>	59.06029552739071
<SOS> he is master of his arm , yet he strikes without remorse . '' <EOS>	89.18874445489817
<SOS> `` the executioner ! '' <EOS>	105.63022672408522
<SOS> muttered athos , as if arrested by some recollection . <EOS>	46.83016532945897
<SOS> `` i know that it is terrible , '' said d'artagnan ; `` but when i reflect that we have killed english , rochellais , spaniards , nay , even french , who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us , whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can , on my honor , find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman . '' <EOS>	56.6907308078623
<SOS> `` as for me , '' said porthos , `` now that you have reminded me of it , athos , i have the scene again before me , as if i now were there . <EOS>	46.90300405044486
<SOS> milady was there , as it were , where you sit . '' <EOS>	94.80967636106097
<SOS> ( athos changed color . ) <EOS>	76.94435815133276
<SOS> `` i i was where d'artagnan stands . <EOS>	77.91107315787525
<SOS> i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it , aramis for you always called it balizarde . <EOS>	80.07739021488675
<SOS> well , i swear to you , all three , that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune ? <EOS>	71.99769802923002
<SOS> yes , egad ! <EOS>	64.03582301850138
<SOS> of bethune ! <EOS>	69.15563830634008
<SOS> not been there , i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it , or even after thinking of it . <EOS>	62.638911308895786
<SOS> she was a most atrocious woman . '' <EOS>	55.679965261186105
<SOS> `` and then , '' said aramis , with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god , `` what is the use of thinking of it all ? <EOS>	66.1477866755167
<SOS> at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime , a fault , or a meritorious deed . <EOS>	48.305186336409975
<SOS> i repent of it ? <EOS>	107.57418482661693
<SOS> egad ! <EOS>	72.10476564475088
<SOS> no . <EOS>	56.50328499386664
<SOS> upon my honor and by the holy cross ; i only regret it because she was a woman . '' <EOS>	90.96387074628716
<SOS> `` the most satisfactory part of the matter , '' said d'artagnan , `` is that there remains no trace of it . '' <EOS>	57.19577220847055
<SOS> `` she had a son , '' observed athos . <EOS>	88.87462509861346
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	98.7778251571821
<SOS> yes , i know that , '' said d'artagnan , `` and you mentioned it to me ; but who knows what has become of him ? <EOS>	79.82717923325917
<SOS> if the serpent be dead , why not its brood ? <EOS>	84.68988812087996
<SOS> do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper ? <EOS>	78.74810061330808
<SOS> de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother . '' <EOS>	88.56503165597711
<SOS> `` then , '' said athos , `` woe to de winter , for the child had done no harm . '' <EOS>	68.49159412328002
<SOS> `` may the devil take me , if the child be not dead , '' said porthos . <EOS>	78.21983035673908
<SOS> `` there is so much fog in that detestable country , at least so d'artagnan declares . '' <EOS>	64.01625786781355
<SOS> just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded , hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door . <EOS>	79.19743297354563
<SOS> `` come in , '' cried athos . <EOS>	89.20125084581309
<SOS> `` please your honors , '' said the host , `` a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you . '' <EOS>	63.75458332876308
<SOS> `` to which of us ? '' <EOS>	95.30342457622278
<SOS> asked all the four friends . <EOS>	74.45898448021515
<SOS> `` to him who is called the comte de la fere . '' <EOS>	75.09645417728815
<SOS> `` it is i , '' said athos , `` and what is the name of the person ? '' <EOS>	55.449584778072435
<SOS> `` grimaud . '' <EOS>	55.84003550666869
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	64.50111864201641
<SOS> exclaimed athos , turning pale . <EOS>	75.3414898410213
<SOS> `` back already ! <EOS>	73.81301220680555
<SOS> what can have happened , then , to bragelonne ? '' <EOS>	93.2821846755615
<SOS> `` let him enter , '' cried d'artagnan ; `` let him come up . '' <EOS>	58.6095308205799
<SOS> but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step ; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it . <EOS>	73.5233924333174
<SOS> the door being closed , the four friends waited in expectation . <EOS>	77.97757921545528
<SOS> grimaud 's agitation , his pallor , the sweat which covered his face , the dust which soiled his clothes , all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news . <EOS>	73.93098065924252
<SOS> `` your honors , '' said he , `` that woman had a child ; that child has become a man ; the tigress had a little one , the tiger has roused himself ; he is ready to spring upon you beware ! '' <EOS>	74.55277440683294
<SOS> athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile . <EOS>	115.19720201483628
<SOS> porthos turned to look at his sword , which was hanging on the wall ; aramis seized his knife ; d'artagnan arose . <EOS>	114.55998123529208
<SOS> `` what do you mean , grimaud ? '' <EOS>	81.52570481535597
<SOS> he exclaimed . <EOS>	69.41416735020151
<SOS> `` that milady 's son has left england , that he is in france , on his road to paris , if he be not here already . '' <EOS>	71.49761924720273
<SOS> `` the devil he is ! '' <EOS>	80.81671099855974

<SOS> this announcement was received in silence . <EOS>	67.25366182606403
<SOS> grimaud was so breathless , so exhausted , that he had fallen back upon a chair . <EOS>	110.31365975068576
<SOS> athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him . <EOS>	69.61894427401856
<SOS> `` well , after all , '' said d'artagnan , `` supposing that he lives , that he comes to paris ; we have seen many other such . <EOS>	60.643991894368625

<SOS> `` moreover , he is but a child , '' said aramis . <EOS>	58.305890105090874

<SOS> disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune , and having confessed him , after having learned everything from him , he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart . <EOS>	64.55413318762184

<SOS> and grimaud threw the dagger on the table . <EOS>	55.46181924886043
<SOS> d'artagnan , porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords . <EOS>	67.49247131359472
<SOS> athos alone remained seated , calm and thoughtful . <EOS>	71.4433948460386
<SOS> `` and you say he is dressed as a monk , grimaud ? '' <EOS>	54.64444662539492
<SOS> `` yes , as an augustine monk . '' <EOS>	65.67912150402802

<SOS> `` yes , on the contrary , they met , and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man . '' <EOS>	89.28294585020896
<SOS> athos , in his turn , rising without speaking , went and unhooked his sword . <EOS>	77.06455514377122
<SOS> `` heigh , sir , '' said d'artagnan , trying to laugh , `` do you know we look very much like a flock of silly , mouse evading women ! <EOS>	64.37749637957442

<SOS> the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques . <EOS>	77.29425365539942
<SOS> it is eleven o'clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i . <EOS>	80.00370421865013
<SOS> leaving the church , a woman and a young girl dressed in black , the one as a widow and the other as an orphan , have re entered their cell . <EOS>	83.1981717643663
<SOS> the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl , leaning against a chair , weeping . <EOS>	53.876151609175814
<SOS> the woman must have once been handsome , but traces of sorrow have aged her . <EOS>	85.02699858246615
<SOS> the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her ; the lady appears to be about forty years of age , the girl about fourteen . <EOS>	116.51256011758397
<SOS> `` oh , god ! '' <EOS>	53.68957404291717

<SOS> `` oh , god ! '' <EOS>	84.58731784762806
<SOS> murmured the girl , `` leave me my mother ! '' <EOS>	76.89105618764714
<SOS> `` your mother can be of no use to you in this world , henrietta , '' said the lady , turning around . <EOS>	67.44924295788444
<SOS> `` your mother has no longer either throne or husband ; she has neither son , money nor friends ; the whole world , my poor child , has abandoned your mother ! '' <EOS>	48.16003462369438

<SOS> `` courage , take courage , my dear mother ! '' <EOS>	54.48447971273214

<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	61.82694667141745
<SOS> 't is an unfortunate year for kings , '' said the mother . <EOS>	73.7962310984956
<SOS> `` and no one thinks of us in this country , for each must think about his own affairs . <EOS>	51.96469831234981

<SOS> we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven ; we are the poor , succored by god . '' <EOS>	101.29705246618366
<SOS> `` but why not address yourself to your sister , the queen ? '' <EOS>	108.01645751276419

<SOS> `` then let us pray to heaven , '' said the girl . <EOS>	67.72943898037522
<SOS> the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv. , the wife and daughter of charles i . <EOS>	76.85039629663643
<SOS> they had just finished their double prayer , when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell . <EOS>	80.04215176840835
<SOS> `` enter , my sister , '' said the queen . <EOS>	68.84092486808609

<SOS> and the queen advanced to meet the messenger , whose hand she seized affectionately , whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her , contained in a case of gold . <EOS>	51.43287331778767
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	74.0898881631651

<SOS> gold , a devoted friend , and a letter from the king , our husband and master . '' <EOS>	95.05614984932477
<SOS> de winter bowed again , unable to reply from excess of emotion . <EOS>	93.61298374659886
<SOS> on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter : `` dear wife , we have now reached the moment of decision . <EOS>	59.89085704080781

<SOS> `` more reason , then , he should protect a king pursued by parliament . '' <EOS>	86.84087046039083

<SOS> oh , my lord ! '' <EOS>	55.636397066681496

<SOS> cromwell 's letter . <EOS>	81.04455742078456
<SOS> at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal , a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin . <EOS>	82.31670000278426
<SOS> although the cardinal was often tormented by fear , he was more often in need of counsel and information , and he was therefore sufficiently accessible . <EOS>	59.32265603560729
<SOS> the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door , and even the second was passed easily enough ; but at the third watched , besides the guard and the doorkeepers , the faithful bernouin , a cerberus whom no speech could soften , no wand , even of gold , could charm . <EOS>	87.32521775878135
<SOS> it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory . <EOS>	115.21208390770329
<SOS> the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court , mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber . <EOS>	60.21568234605897

<SOS> `` have you a letter of audience ? '' <EOS>	48.28041271874652

<SOS> `` i have one , but not one from cardinal mazarin . '' <EOS>	65.62599831235543

<SOS> whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident , monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed . <EOS>	72.64030200381838

<SOS> hair sandy red more red than sandy ; gray blue eyes more gray than blue ; and for the rest , stiff and proud . '' <EOS>	80.4665374224609
<SOS> `` let him give in his letter . '' <EOS>	62.064810482647914
<SOS> `` his eminence asks for the letter , '' said bernouin , passing back into the ante chamber . <EOS>	60.50818425483578
<SOS> `` his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it , '' replied the young man ; `` but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter , see , here it is ; and kindly add , '' continued he , `` that i am not a simple messenger , but an envoy extraordinary . '' <EOS>	103.94287138857287
<SOS> bernouin re entered the cabinet , returning in a few seconds . <EOS>	75.1569050658257
<SOS> `` enter , sir , '' said he . <EOS>	77.03487710653759
<SOS> the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister 's closet , in one hand holding his hat , in the other the letter . <EOS>	72.5488284071209
<SOS> mazarin rose . <EOS>	98.1435626975014
<SOS> `` have you , sir , '' asked he , `` a letter accrediting you to me ? '' <EOS>	68.00461818742752
<SOS> `` there it is , my lord , '' said the young man . <EOS>	97.55546158480358
<SOS> mazarin took the letter and read it thus : `` mr. mordaunt , one of my secretaries , will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence , the cardinal mazarin , in paris . <EOS>	67.1516222434223
<SOS> he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence . <EOS>	53.625253871385056
<SOS> `` oliver cromwell . '' <EOS>	81.04759057611199
<SOS> `` very well , monsieur mordaunt , '' said mazarin , `` give me this second letter and sit down . '' <EOS>	117.13637825726985
<SOS> the young man drew from his pocket a second letter , presented it to the cardinal , and took his seat . <EOS>	41.112749703278766
<SOS> the cardinal , however , did not unseal the letter at once , but continued to turn it again and again in his hand ; then , in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them , fixing his eyes upon them at the same time , he thus addressed the messenger : `` you are very young , monsieur mordaunt , for this difficult task of ambassador , in which the oldest diplomatists often fail . '' <EOS>	54.38914718274056
<SOS> `` my lord , i am twenty three years of age ; but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young . <EOS>	48.85797348354382
<SOS> i am older than your eminence , although i possess not your wisdom . <EOS>	76.48358638099047
<SOS> years of suffering , in my opinion , count double , and i have suffered for twenty years . '' <EOS>	79.28586293475065
<SOS> `` ah , yes , i understand , '' said mazarin ; `` want of fortune , perhaps . <EOS>	65.29245230226444
<SOS> you are poor , are you not ? '' <EOS>	50.672795871000595
<SOS> then he added to himself : `` these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred . '' <EOS>	90.59524554140827
<SOS> `` my lord , i ought to have a fortune of six millions , but it has been taken from me . '' <EOS>	100.57499536309615
<SOS> `` you are not , then , a man of the people ? '' <EOS>	79.43507198362079
<SOS> said mazarin , astonished . <EOS>	101.42626959233498
<SOS> `` if i bore my proper title i should be a lord . <EOS>	52.603085385433396
<SOS> if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england . '' <EOS>	63.10517530455808
<SOS> `` what is your name , then ? '' <EOS>	60.637806006734685
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	89.64281980041648
<SOS> `` my name is mordaunt , '' replied the young man , bowing . <EOS>	56.71979965821592
<SOS> mazarin now understood that cromwell 's envoy desired to retain his incognito . <EOS>	90.36432303638875
<SOS> he was silent for an instant , and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first . <EOS>	88.30509642331529
<SOS> the messenger was unmoved . <EOS>	89.23985266609374
<SOS> `` devil take these puritans , '' said mazarin aside ; `` they are carved from granite . '' <EOS>	59.35306578725055
<SOS> then he added aloud , `` but you have relations left you ? '' <EOS>	49.85635785638329
<SOS> `` i have one remaining . <EOS>	84.62812789852704
<SOS> three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away . '' <EOS>	107.83057766710246
<SOS> `` oh , mon dieu ! <EOS>	72.30181322791381
<SOS> my dear mr. mordaunt , '' said mazarin , hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare , `` how extremely your history interests me ! <EOS>	54.39522066568269
<SOS> you know not , then , anything of your birth you have never seen your mother ? '' <EOS>	81.31610578232807
<SOS> `` yes , my lord ; she came three times , whilst i was a child , to my nurse 's house ; i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day . '' <EOS>	78.29889294705863
<SOS> `` you have a good memory , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	84.80203805282147
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	61.70856381480425
<SOS> yes , my lord , '' said the young man , with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein . <EOS>	72.15231376752962
<SOS> `` and who brought you up ? '' <EOS>	48.45019472564992
<SOS> he asked again . <EOS>	41.63657272376979
<SOS> `` a french nurse , who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me , telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak . '' <EOS>	73.74611251816472
<SOS> `` what became of you ? '' <EOS>	60.96828629731713
<SOS> `` as i was weeping and begging on the high road , a minister from kingston took me in , instructed me in the calvinistic faith , taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family . '' <EOS>	49.34594947460175
<SOS> `` and these researches ? '' <EOS>	101.71712189377288
<SOS> `` were fruitless ; chance did everything . '' <EOS>	73.97893500900678
<SOS> `` you discovered what had become of your mother ? '' <EOS>	103.23919585664343
<SOS> `` i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation , aided by four friends , but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i . '' <EOS>	60.76824967762354
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	78.30771041072974
<SOS> i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell ; you hate the king . '' <EOS>	97.746534854854
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , i hate him ! '' <EOS>	49.20283249686067
<SOS> said the young man . <EOS>	91.5766738065526
<SOS> mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words . <EOS>	45.72546617006431
<SOS> just as , ordinarily , faces are colored by blood , his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid . <EOS>	74.04956222396206
<SOS> `` your history is a terrible one , mr. mordaunt , and touches me keenly ; but happily for you , you serve an all powerful master ; he ought to aid you in your search ; we have so many means of gaining information . '' <EOS>	63.10926548148809
<SOS> `` my lord , to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track ; he is certain to reach the other . '' <EOS>	76.1863306583369
<SOS> `` but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him ? '' <EOS>	98.4892377589493
<SOS> said mazarin , who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell 's person . <EOS>	64.59185455013609
<SOS> `` thanks , my lord , i will speak to him myself . <EOS>	80.73322815405842
<SOS> he will treat me better the next time i see him . '' <EOS>	61.099487159316084
<SOS> `` you have the means , then , of touching him ? '' <EOS>	102.21124250242363
<SOS> `` i have the means of making myself feared . '' <EOS>	88.0341744770244
<SOS> mazarin looked at the young man , but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head ; then , embarrassed how to continue such a conversation , he opened cromwell 's letter . <EOS>	51.56686860462224
<SOS> the young man 's eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie . <EOS>	57.2193233969077
<SOS> after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read . <EOS>	46.67213021121633
<SOS> observing his indifference , he shrugged his shoulders , saying : `` send on your business those who do theirs at the same time ! <EOS>	69.30994355054295
<SOS> let us see what this letter contains . '' <EOS>	57.86420206367182
<SOS> we here present the letter verbatim : `` to his eminence , monseigneur le cardinal mazarini : `` i have wished , monseigneur , to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england . <EOS>	66.44556477586613
<SOS> the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation , as we are interested in that of france . <EOS>	54.53169246561641
<SOS> the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents . <EOS>	69.27119140828133
<SOS> placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement , i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results . <EOS>	66.27459842065873
<SOS> i am at present in the midst of war , and am about to deliver a decisive battle against king charles . <EOS>	93.16562038508302
<SOS> i shall gain it , for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me . <EOS>	51.294952895371786
<SOS> this battle won by me , the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland ; and if he is not captured or killed , he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money . <EOS>	78.05545116076586
<SOS> france has already received queen henrietta , and , unintentionally , doubtless , has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country . <EOS>	49.957922346363155
<SOS> but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality of france . <EOS>	55.18401582308254
<SOS> as to king charles , the question must be viewed differently ; in receiving and aiding him , france will censure the acts of the english nation , and thus so essentially harm england , and especially the well being of the government , that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities . '' <EOS>	73.37378396075744
<SOS> at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man . <EOS>	44.936893895054155
<SOS> the latter continued in thought . <EOS>	50.93900437218415
<SOS> mazarin resumed his reading : `` it is important , therefore , monseigneur , that i should be informed as to the intentions of france . <EOS>	82.72089383300167
<SOS> the interests of that kingdom and those of england , though taking now diverse directions , are very nearly the same . <EOS>	58.68690466228938
<SOS> england needs tranquillity at home , in order to consummate the expulsion of her king ; france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch . <EOS>	80.86836937919284
<SOS> you need , as much as we do , that interior condition of repose which , thanks to the energy of our government , we are about to attain . <EOS>	95.60928052163034
<SOS> `` your quarrels with the parliament , your noisy dissensions with the princes , who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you , the popular following directed by the coadjutor , president blancmesnil , and councillor broussel all that disorder , in short , which pervades the several departments of the state , must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war ; for in that event england , exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas , will ally herself with spain , already seeking that alliance . <EOS>	41.28366365872943
<SOS> i have therefore believed , monseigneur , knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time , that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england . <EOS>	48.963083539629146
<SOS> that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms , with money or with troops . <EOS>	78.60388384861616
<SOS> `` my letter is private and confidential , and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels . <EOS>	65.22852358330623
<SOS> it anticipates , through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate , measures to be taken after the events . <EOS>	108.37108669709558
<SOS> oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarin 's than to a queen admirable for firmness , without doubt , but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right . <EOS>	53.48789600577856
<SOS> `` farewell , monseigneur ; should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days , i shall presume my letter will have miscarried . <EOS>	79.78224354663585
<SOS> `` oliver cromwell . '' <EOS>	113.55668071285909
<SOS> `` mr. mordaunt , '' said the cardinal , raising his voice , as if to arouse the dreamer , `` my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one ; go , therefore , and await it at boulogne sur mer , and promise me to set out to morrow morning . '' <EOS>	66.75086320566467
<SOS> `` i promise , my lord , '' replied mordaunt ; `` but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply ? '' <EOS>	60.2978604080874
<SOS> `` if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave . '' <EOS>	54.62296573965467
<SOS> mordaunt bowed . <EOS>	69.12412984038755
<SOS> `` that is not all , sir , '' continued mazarin ; `` your private adventures have touched me to the quick ; besides , the letter from mr. cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador ; come , tell me , what can i do for you ? '' <EOS>	86.61131890944456
<SOS> mordaunt reflected a moment and , after some hesitation , was about to speak , when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal , whispered : `` my lord , the queen henrietta maria , accompanied by an english noble , is entering the palais royal at this moment . '' <EOS>	84.76447122820603
<SOS> mazarin made a bound from his chair , which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make . <EOS>	77.29976224379558
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the cardinal , `` you have heard me ? <EOS>	78.10589145279432
<SOS> i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you ; if you prefer another , name it ; but you can easily conceive that , surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion , i desire your presence in paris to be unknown . '' <EOS>	69.95282530057085
<SOS> `` i go , sir , '' said mordaunt , advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered . <EOS>	67.79619560413761
<SOS> `` no , not that way , i beg , sir , '' quickly exclaimed the cardinal , `` be so good as to pass by yonder gallery , by which you can regain the hall . <EOS>	55.879419977416056
<SOS> i do not wish you to be seen leaving ; our interview must be kept secret . '' <EOS>	90.8932364677394
<SOS> mordaunt followed bernouin , who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper , showing him the way out . <EOS>	62.228868827018935
<SOS> chapter xxxviii . <EOS>	60.957931070414155
<SOS> henrietta maria and mazarin . <EOS>	92.70352206492309
<SOS> the cardinal rose , and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england . <EOS>	69.6384394885258
<SOS> he showed the more respect to this queen , deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers , as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice . <EOS>	51.09540800570167
<SOS> but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features , and the daughter of henry iv . <EOS>	81.41757839831115
<SOS> smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised . <EOS>	67.07815234735618
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	58.25319557694627
<SOS> said mazarin to himself , `` what a sweet face ; does she come to borrow money of me ? '' <EOS>	63.877605410564634
<SOS> and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box ; he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring , the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand , which indeed was white and handsome . <EOS>	79.76917899526516
<SOS> `` your eminence , '' said the august visitor , `` it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen , my sister , but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men . '' <EOS>	70.74592164009255
<SOS> `` madame , '' said mazarin , `` your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction . '' <EOS>	52.414536455077176
<SOS> `` he is very gracious , '' thought the queen ; `` can he have guessed my errand ? '' <EOS>	89.74095734108158
<SOS> `` give , '' continued the cardinal , `` your commands to the most respectful of your servants . '' <EOS>	73.24495273856198
<SOS> `` alas , sir , '' replied the queen , `` i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions . <EOS>	85.51680723109314
<SOS> i am here to petition you , too happy should my prayer be favorably heard . '' <EOS>	54.645016223019105
<SOS> `` i am listening , madame , with the greatest interest , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	60.77661986559631
<SOS> `` your eminence , it concerns the war which the king , my husband , is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects . <EOS>	54.005341770121724
<SOS> you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england , '' added she , with a melancholy smile , `` and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto . '' <EOS>	60.799487596481406
<SOS> `` i am completely ignorant of it , madame , '' said the cardinal , accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders ; `` alas , our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor , incapable , infirm old minister like me . '' <EOS>	75.69706933465885
<SOS> `` well , then , your eminence , '' said the queen , `` i must inform you that charles i. , my husband , is on the eve of a decisive engagement . <EOS>	96.03592414461666
<SOS> in case of a check '' ( mazarin made a slight movement ) , `` one must foresee everything ; in the case of a check , he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual . <EOS>	59.67297812537619
<SOS> what do you say to this project ? '' <EOS>	57.62805927319315
<SOS> the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt , and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering ; and when the queen finished speaking , he said : `` do you think , madame , that france , agitated and disturbed as it is , would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king ? <EOS>	88.3666500503999
<SOS> how will the crown , which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv. , support a double weight ? '' <EOS>	90.82635558529381
<SOS> `` the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril , '' interrupted the queen , with a sad smile , `` and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me ; you see that we are very humble monarchs , sir . '' <EOS>	70.77054020965066
<SOS> `` oh , you , madame , '' the cardinal hastened to say , in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming , `` with regard to you , that is another thing . <EOS>	94.03785601893432
<SOS> a daughter of henry iv. , of that great , that sublime sovereign `` `` all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law , sir ! <EOS>	119.36818173470363
<SOS> nevertheless , you ought to remember that that great , that sublime monarch , when proscribed at one time , as my husband may be , demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him ; and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece . '' <EOS>	60.37474366326393
<SOS> `` peccato ! '' <EOS>	74.31453209080594
<SOS> said mazarin , writhing beneath this simple eloquence , `` your majesty does not understand me ; you judge my intentions wrongly , and that is partly because , doubtless , i explain myself in french . '' <EOS>	47.096098682188135
<SOS> `` speak italian , sir . <EOS>	55.96635346742689
<SOS> ere the cardinal , your predecessor , sent our mother , marie de medicis , to die in exile , she taught us that language . <EOS>	63.572888416354225
<SOS> if anything yet remains of that great , that sublime king , henry , of whom you have just spoken , he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself . '' <EOS>	105.41184017979077
<SOS> the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin 's brow . <EOS>	90.41571309747572
<SOS> `` that admiration is , on the contrary , so great , so real , madame , '' returned mazarin , without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen , `` that if the king , charles i. whom heaven protect from evil ! <EOS>	117.83003108252868
<SOS> came into france , i would offer him my house my own house ; but , alas ! <EOS>	79.08129888204631
<SOS> it would be but an unsafe retreat . <EOS>	98.45228370422294
<SOS> some day the people will burn that house , as they burned that of the marechal d'ancre . <EOS>	71.04345020030489
<SOS> poor concino concini ! <EOS>	105.09611174625668
<SOS> and yet he but desired the good of the people . '' <EOS>	81.43700323735153
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , like yourself ! '' <EOS>	79.80819383505697
<SOS> said the queen , ironically . <EOS>	65.29866187244828
<SOS> mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence , but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini . <EOS>	85.54024302263454
<SOS> `` well then , your eminence , '' said the queen , becoming impatient , `` what is your answer ? '' <EOS>	69.2669093212648
<SOS> `` madame , '' cried mazarin , more and more moved , `` will your majesty permit me to give you counsel ? '' <EOS>	79.77862787353781
<SOS> `` speak , sir , '' replied the queen ; `` the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available . '' <EOS>	70.7703706150643
<SOS> `` madame , believe me , the king ought to defend himself to the last . '' <EOS>	102.8559515659193
<SOS> `` he has done so , sir , and this last battle , which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy , proves that he will not yield without a struggle ; but in case he is beaten ? '' <EOS>	86.22837154208288

<SOS> `` but , '' persisted the queen , `` if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart , send him help of men and money , for i can do nothing for him ; i have sold even to my last diamond to aid him . <EOS>	58.47606782280567
<SOS> if i had had a single ornament left , i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself . '' <EOS>	75.04093146626765
<SOS> `` oh , madame , '' said mazarin , `` your majesty knows not what you ask . <EOS>	75.73394814299955

<SOS> `` to the point , sir , '' said the queen , `` to the point , and answer me , yes or no ; if the king persists in remaining in england will you send him succor ? <EOS>	71.88503709372397

<SOS> `` madame , '' said the cardinal , affecting an effusive frankness of speech , `` i shall convince your majesty , i trust , of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart . <EOS>	107.15944481484806
<SOS> after which your majesty will , i think , no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf . '' <EOS>	82.22354136264383
<SOS> the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair . <EOS>	62.68940694525735
<SOS> `` well , what do you propose to do ? '' <EOS>	54.84002708605743
<SOS> she , said at length ; `` come , speak . '' <EOS>	54.94280589648585
<SOS> `` i will go this instant and consult the queen , and we will refer the affair at once to parliament . '' <EOS>	47.9319246336012

<SOS> i understand you or rather , i am wrong . <EOS>	59.57709079270451
<SOS> go to the parliament , for it was from this parliament , the enemy of monarchs , that the daughter of the great , the sublime henry iv. , whom you so much admire , received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold ! '' <EOS>	74.6984747898392
<SOS> and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation , whilst the cardinal , raising his hands clasped toward her , exclaimed , `` ah , madame , madame , how little you know me , mon dieu ! '' <EOS>	81.94773011707942
<SOS> but queen henrietta , without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions , crossed the cabinet , opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal 's numerous guards , courtiers eager to pay homage , the luxurious show of a competing royalty , she went and took the hand of de winter , who stood apart in isolation . <EOS>	85.57974327422087
<SOS> poor queen , already fallen ! <EOS>	53.356831424159466
<SOS> though all bowed before her , as etiquette required , she had now but a single arm on which she could lean . <EOS>	87.34599507759144
<SOS> `` it signifies little , '' said mazarin , when he was alone . <EOS>	69.26547650448425

<SOS> bernouin entered . <EOS>	61.38610313564045
<SOS> `` see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair , who was with me just now , is still in the palace . '' <EOS>	108.3424978282267
<SOS> bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges , who was on guard . <EOS>	101.0007852332417
<SOS> `` your eminence , '' said comminges , `` as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked , he approached the glass door of the gallery , and gazed intently upon some object , doubtless the picture by raphael , which is opposite the door . <EOS>	63.5163939715208
<SOS> he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs . <EOS>	94.03740935819496
<SOS> i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court . <EOS>	78.45878420700541
<SOS> but is not your eminence going to the queen ? '' <EOS>	62.77218437901852
<SOS> `` for what purpose ? '' <EOS>	89.09236370487362
<SOS> `` monsieur de guitant , my uncle , has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army . '' <EOS>	63.299651623223966
<SOS> `` it is well ; i will go . '' <EOS>	102.77437122001807
<SOS> comminges had seen rightly , and mordaunt had really acted as he had related . <EOS>	104.6331997647447
<SOS> in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery , he perceived de winter , who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation . <EOS>	97.60426740548525
<SOS> at this sight the young man stopped short , not in admiration of raphael 's picture , but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object . <EOS>	100.74404750474797
<SOS> his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body . <EOS>	63.1252886985593
<SOS> one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy ; for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter , he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe . <EOS>	60.600990321595766
<SOS> but he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to lord de winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen 's carriage had left the court . <EOS>	65.20880903665876
<SOS> he had not long to wait , for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin , but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him . <EOS>	63.84638363384363
<SOS> at last the heavy machine , which was called a chariot in those days , came out , rumbling against the gates , and de winter , still on horseback , bent again to the door to converse with her majesty . <EOS>	69.88168050002757
<SOS> the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre , which they entered . <EOS>	50.52569702732146
<SOS> before leaving the convent of the carmelites , henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace , which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers . <EOS>	67.55541710100266
<SOS> mordaunt followed the carriage , and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended , and remained motionless , amidst the moldings of jean goujon , like a bas relievo , representing an equestrian statue . <EOS>	61.67649319469046

<SOS> `` i did not say france , my lord ; i said the cardinal , and the cardinal is not even a frenchman . '' <EOS>	85.63904043300545

<SOS> he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse . <EOS>	62.256316669378734
<SOS> then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal , the passing to and fro of busy people ? <EOS>	76.25876742243906

<SOS> i set out three days ago , passing miraculously through the puritan army , and i took post horses with my servant tony ; the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris . <EOS>	82.98533191984224
<SOS> besides , the king , i am certain , awaits your majesty 's reply before risking anything . '' <EOS>	85.02770238216833
<SOS> `` you will tell him , my lord , '' resumed the queen , despairingly , `` that i can do nothing ; that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears ; and as regards his royal person , he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king . <EOS>	41.9033428284343
<SOS> i shall go and die by his side . '' <EOS>	70.10852240489362
<SOS> `` madame , madame , '' exclaimed de winter , `` your majesty abandons yourself to despair ; and yet , perhaps , there still remains some hope . '' <EOS>	98.0504114362834
<SOS> `` no friends left , my lord ; no other friends left in the wide world but yourself ! <EOS>	61.93412354631048
<SOS> oh , god ! '' <EOS>	53.34004163255076
<SOS> exclaimed the poor queen , raising her eyes to heaven , `` have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world ? '' <EOS>	46.33677770811368
<SOS> `` i hope not , madame , '' replied de winter , thoughtfully ; `` i once spoke to you of four men . '' <EOS>	51.72206833386316
<SOS> `` what can be done with four ? '' <EOS>	65.55487658146053
<SOS> `` four devoted , resolute men can do much , assure yourself , madame ; and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time . '' <EOS>	92.9484453057912

<SOS> `` ah , that is what i do not know . <EOS>	58.21146408268356
<SOS> it is twenty years since i saw them , and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them . '' <EOS>	75.9289049605487
<SOS> `` and these men were your friends ? '' <EOS>	77.62466042746674
<SOS> `` one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me . <EOS>	60.14417169137722

<SOS> `` and these men are in france , my lord ? '' <EOS>	94.51590397367893
<SOS> `` i believe so . '' <EOS>	51.02451564701239
<SOS> `` tell me their names ; perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them . '' <EOS>	48.59466589340914

<SOS> `` ah , my lord , if i mistake not , the chevalier d'artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards ; but take care , for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal . '' <EOS>	94.06592558607989
<SOS> `` that would be a misfortune , '' said de winter , `` and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed . '' <EOS>	60.04429820360496
<SOS> `` but the others , '' said the queen , who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel . <EOS>	89.38034595846318

<SOS> `` oh , mon dieu , it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out , '' said the queen , `` since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king . '' <EOS>	61.11051808712897

<SOS> have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen ? '' <EOS>	91.09624777743682
<SOS> `` yes , at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham ; it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds . '' <EOS>	89.53784300169389
<SOS> `` well , it was that affair , madame ; these men are the ones who saved her ; and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them , who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm .

<SOS> `` well , then , my lord , they must be found ; but what can four men , or rather three men do for i tell you , you must not count on monsieur d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	91.35436838722862
<SOS> `` it will be one valiant sword the less , but there will remain still three , without reckoning my own ; now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies , to be at his side in battle , to aid him with counsel , to escort him in flight , are sufficient , not to make the king a conqueror , but to save him if conquered ; and whatever mazarin may say , once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm . '' <EOS>	58.62440693253748
<SOS> `` seek , then , my lord , seek these gentlemen ; and if they will consent to go with you to england , i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne , besides as much gold as would pave whitehall . <EOS>	54.186340797552475

<SOS> `` then indeed we are lost ! '' <EOS>	67.39772617684828
<SOS> cried the queen , in the fullness of a broken heart . <EOS>	60.03068234002951
<SOS> at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared ; then the queen , with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents , repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject . <EOS>	66.7484192420454
<SOS> but that act of self control , effective as it was , did not escape the eyes of the young princess . <EOS>	108.53289237802848
<SOS> she stopped on the threshold , breathed a sigh , and addressing the queen : `` why , then , do you always weep , mother , when i am away from you ? '' <EOS>	53.138247978450735
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	64.78338774306934
<SOS> the queen smiled , but instead of answering : `` see , de winter , '' she said , `` i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen ; and that is that my children call me 'mother ' instead of 'madame . ' '' <EOS>	50.724934343830284
<SOS> then turning toward her daughter : `` what do you want , henrietta ? '' <EOS>	56.652866111175626
<SOS> she demanded . <EOS>	50.456752217682954
<SOS> `` my mother , '' replied the young princess , `` a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty ; he arrives from the army and has , he says , a letter to remit to you , on the part of the marechal de grammont , i think . '' <EOS>	70.10783302259239
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	68.00497851119448
<SOS> said the queen to de winter , `` he is one of my faithful adherents ; but do you not observe , my dear lord , that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper ? '' <EOS>	83.695640765087
<SOS> `` madame , have pity on me , '' exclaimed de winter ; `` you wring my heart ! '' <EOS>	56.1007090581326
<SOS> `` and who is this cavalier , henrietta ? '' <EOS>	91.66185030854523
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	76.46596771130669
<SOS> `` i saw him from the window , madame ; he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age , and is called the viscount de bragelonne . '' <EOS>	41.61895127520257
<SOS> the queen , smiling , made a sign with her head ; the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold . <EOS>	81.14810940239241
<SOS> advancing a few steps toward the queen , he knelt down . <EOS>	61.207335591756355
<SOS> `` madame , '' said he , `` i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche , who told me he had the honor of being your servant ; this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect . '' <EOS>	56.936030342388314
<SOS> at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity . <EOS>	83.25809313604636
<SOS> `` you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont , henrietta ! '' <EOS>	73.9038730893523
<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	94.52900660673595
<SOS> `` i thought so , madame , '' stammered the young girl . <EOS>	54.048050456006145
<SOS> `` it is my fault , madame , '' said raoul . <EOS>	73.20456500051378
<SOS> `` i did announce myself , in truth , as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont ; but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary . '' <EOS>	65.83519488464967
<SOS> `` there has been fighting , then ? '' <EOS>	82.91709481761865
<SOS> asked the queen , motioning to raoul to rise . <EOS>	56.43064170055307
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' said the young man . <EOS>	56.752930694711026
<SOS> at this announcement of a battle having taken place , the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest ; but her lips closed again without articulating a word , while the color gradually faded from her cheeks . <EOS>	75.89679096658065
<SOS> the queen saw this , and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion , for addressing raoul again : `` and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche ? '' <EOS>	70.85843088190141
<SOS> she asked ; `` for not only is he our servant , as you say , sir , but more he is one of our friends . '' <EOS>	55.604759022546496
<SOS> `` no , madame , '' replied raoul ; `` on the contrary , he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness , the prince , on the field of battle . '' <EOS>	68.00642122285801
<SOS> the young princess clapped her hands ; and then , ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy , she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses , as if to inhale their odor . <EOS>	116.25419086093143
<SOS> `` let us see , '' said the queen , `` what the count says . '' <EOS>	83.06726485628104
<SOS> and she opened the letter and read : `` madame , being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself , by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand , i have commanded my son , the count de guiche , who , with his father , is equally your humble servant , to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens , and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe . <EOS>	66.73064446850752
<SOS> if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment , in favor of her august husband , the court of france . <EOS>	75.37724617068767
<SOS> the vicomte de bragelonne , who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty , is the friend of my son , who owes to him his life ; he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely , in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me . <EOS>	58.083393835089836
<SOS> `` i have the honor to be , with respect , etc. , `` marechal de grammont . '' <EOS>	58.86602272415402
<SOS> at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count , raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess , and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man ; he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i. loved his friend . <EOS>	90.24245171832244
<SOS> `` the battle of lens gained ! '' <EOS>	93.17426974148901

<SOS> yes , the marechal de grammont is right ; this will change the aspect of french affairs , but i much fear it will do nothing for english , even if it does not harm them . <EOS>	54.66073851951328
<SOS> this is recent news , sir , '' continued she , `` and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me ; without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow , perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris . '' <EOS>	59.742675703344446
<SOS> `` madame , '' said raoul , `` the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached ; it is as yet unknown to all , and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian . '' <EOS>	105.2868480157753
<SOS> `` your guardian ! <EOS>	81.16945363617644

<SOS> `` i once knew a bragelonne is he still alive ? '' <EOS>	41.0711986688464
<SOS> `` no , sir , he is dead ; and i believe it is from him my guardian , whose near relation he was , inherited the estate from which i take my name . '' <EOS>	48.54148950233923
<SOS> `` and your guardian , sir , '' asked the queen , who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her , `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	73.82341236665769
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere , madame , '' replied the young man , bowing . <EOS>	58.99199139006673
<SOS> de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy . <EOS>	106.43850121007054

<SOS> `` have you not mentioned that name to me ? '' <EOS>	90.34246953284661
<SOS> as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright . <EOS>	94.52805011819918
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere ! '' <EOS>	105.99497967781045
<SOS> he cried in his turn . <EOS>	64.29809443683794
<SOS> `` oh , sir , reply , i entreat you is not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember , handsome and brave , a musketeer under louis xiii. , who must be now about forty seven or forty eight years of age ? '' <EOS>	63.241447311639696
<SOS> `` yes , sir , you are right in every particular ! '' <EOS>	61.481465941714134
<SOS> `` and who served under an assumed name ? '' <EOS>	92.18967307777966
<SOS> `` under the name of athos . <EOS>	45.5885126990488

<SOS> `` that is it , madame , that is the same . <EOS>	93.20029961605321
<SOS> god be praised ! <EOS>	88.03098509661928
<SOS> and he is in paris ? '' <EOS>	63.54379477179196
<SOS> continued he , addressing raoul ; then turning to the queen : `` we may still hope . <EOS>	119.88978832223196
<SOS> providence has declared for us , since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner . <EOS>	74.73374839036016
<SOS> and , sir , where does he reside , pray ? '' <EOS>	71.13533805459437
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud , hotel du grand roi charlemagne . '' <EOS>	55.69464863129702
<SOS> `` thanks , sir . <EOS>	77.39424322363617
<SOS> inform this dear friend that he may remain within , that i shall go and see him immediately . '' <EOS>	80.62823790799804
<SOS> `` sir , i obey with pleasure , if her majesty will permit me to depart . '' <EOS>	76.54465757344038
<SOS> `` go , monsieur de bragelonne , '' said the queen , `` and rest assured of our affection . '' <EOS>	83.76222398223048
<SOS> raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses , and bowing to de winter , departed . <EOS>	68.97076404322662
<SOS> the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices , in order that the young princess should not overhear them ; but the precaution was needless : she was in deep converse with her own thoughts . <EOS>	113.12687098251408
<SOS> then , when de winter rose to take leave : `` listen , my lord , '' said the queen ; `` i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother , and this order of st. michael which came from my husband . <EOS>	90.5374885109908
<SOS> they are worth about fifty thousand pounds . <EOS>	68.97325057339768
<SOS> i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges ; but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders , everything must be sacrificed . <EOS>	75.55926462884787
<SOS> take them , and if you need money for your expedition , sell them fearlessly , my lord . <EOS>	69.74416021311573
<SOS> but should you find the means of retaining them , remember , my lord , that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen ; and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children . '' <EOS>	75.80021455348745
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied de winter , `` your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you . <EOS>	60.605492357771126
<SOS> i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place , nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us , but our estates are confiscated , our ready money is exhausted , and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess . <EOS>	84.920054141168
<SOS> in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere , and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply . '' <EOS>	78.49737396115059
<SOS> the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter , who , kissing it respectfully , went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large , dark and deserted apartments , brushing away tears which , blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier , he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified , yet so intense . <EOS>	70.10679660807779

<SOS> uncle and nephew . <EOS>	58.06137954780294
<SOS> the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door ; he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully , looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre . <EOS>	58.20856780951888
<SOS> it was then that he saw a horseman , as it were , detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance . <EOS>	51.062997807413474
<SOS> in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow . <EOS>	102.21341714305944
<SOS> `` tony , '' he said , motioning to his groom to approach . <EOS>	92.15093337782632
<SOS> `` here i am , my lord . '' <EOS>	68.66311900001239
<SOS> `` did you remark that man who is following us ? '' <EOS>	58.02924447916241
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	68.14373620220115
<SOS> `` who is he ? '' <EOS>	79.53991223575078
<SOS> `` i do not know , only he has followed your grace from the palais royal , stopped at the louvre to wait for you , and now leaves the louvre with you . '' <EOS>	92.62509474245441
<SOS> `` some spy of the cardinal , '' said de winter to him , aside . <EOS>	68.26957844238338
<SOS> `` let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us . '' <EOS>	84.18013349693987
<SOS> and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel , situated near the marais , for having for so long a time lived near the place royale , lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling . <EOS>	63.096038247031785
<SOS> the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop . <EOS>	57.77297858507015
<SOS> de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment , intending to watch the spy ; but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table , he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room . <EOS>	77.88114950724473
<SOS> he turned around and mordaunt stood before him . <EOS>	112.78264242285802
<SOS> there was a moment of frozen silence between these two . <EOS>	90.91787124276799
<SOS> `` sir , '' said de winter , `` i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution ; withdraw , then , or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london . <EOS>	79.21140197272351
<SOS> i am not your uncle , i know you not . '' <EOS>	50.96428916280319
<SOS> `` my uncle , '' replied mordaunt , with his harsh and bantering tone , `` you are mistaken ; you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not . <EOS>	75.55995260091233
<SOS> as for denying that i am your nephew , you will think twice about it , now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago . '' <EOS>	93.40789760840335
<SOS> `` and how does it concern me what you have learned ? '' <EOS>	72.05942985515091
<SOS> said de winter . <EOS>	60.34718528837398
<SOS> `` oh , it concerns you very closely , my uncle , i am sure , and you will soon be of my opinion , '' added he , with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed . <EOS>	57.79083339009862
<SOS> `` when i presented myself before you for the first time in london , it was to ask you what had become of my fortune ; the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name ; and this time i come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other , to say to you as god said to the first murderer : 'cain , what hast thou done to thy brother abel ? ' <EOS>	86.93850158853732
<SOS> my lord , what have you done with your sister your sister , who was my mother ? '' <EOS>	81.00034563735677
<SOS> de winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes . <EOS>	72.54982533870526
<SOS> `` your mother ? '' <EOS>	55.594866981267586
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	72.69085565702112
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , my mother , '' replied the young man , advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter , and crossing his arms . <EOS>	74.13079582914642
<SOS> `` i have asked the headsman of bethune , '' he said , his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief . <EOS>	104.51917738526645
<SOS> `` and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply . '' <EOS>	54.69172794784913
<SOS> de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply . <EOS>	84.93060842778677
<SOS> `` yes , '' continued the young man ; `` all is now explained ; with this key i open the abyss . <EOS>	74.06811825344437
<SOS> my mother inherited an estate from her husband , you have assassinated her ; my name would have secured me the paternal estate , you have deprived me of it ; you have despoiled me of my fortune . <EOS>	46.36679278555175
<SOS> i am no longer astonished that you knew me not . <EOS>	84.01945981963254
<SOS> i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me . <EOS>	63.723771764592215
<SOS> when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished ; when one is a murderer , to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan . '' <EOS>	73.98821966443947
<SOS> these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated . <EOS>	82.04877673498025
<SOS> de winter remembered the monster that milady had been ; he rose , dignified and calm , restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man . <EOS>	95.8820640372744
<SOS> `` you desire to fathom this horrible secret ? '' <EOS>	82.213009799946
<SOS> said de winter ; `` well , then , so be it . <EOS>	85.59463540207143
<SOS> know , then , what manner of woman it was for whom to day you call me to account . <EOS>	82.19929718804914
<SOS> that woman had , in all probability , poisoned my brother , and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn . <EOS>	50.765336662763346
<SOS> i have proof of it . <EOS>	79.61077558336477
<SOS> what say you to that ? '' <EOS>	99.24677825284297
<SOS> `` i say that she was my mother . '' <EOS>	102.00354852123218
<SOS> `` she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was , ere that , honest , good and pure . <EOS>	58.621439572041204
<SOS> what say you to that crime , of which i have the proof ? '' <EOS>	66.93974427413924
<SOS> `` she was my mother . '' <EOS>	89.10920004875074
<SOS> `` on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune . <EOS>	59.36759141821753
<SOS> will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs ? '' <EOS>	70.05795419590343
<SOS> `` she was my mother ! '' <EOS>	69.01782941690257
<SOS> cried the young man , who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force . <EOS>	89.20551974288101
<SOS> `` at last , charged with murders , with debauchery , hated by every one and yet threatening still , like a panther thirsting for blood , she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate , though they had never done her the least injury ; she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked ; and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner , if he told you everything , told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother 's shame and suicide . <EOS>	69.47979856990236
<SOS> depraved as a girl , adulterous as a wife , an unnatural sister , homicide , poisoner , execrated by all who knew her , by every nation that had been visited by her , she died accursed by heaven and earth . '' <EOS>	93.03722040696627
<SOS> a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood ; he clenched his fists , sweat covered his face , his hair , like hamlet 's , stood on end , and racked with fury he cried out : `` silence , sir ! <EOS>	54.79226826355925
<SOS> she was my mother ! <EOS>	65.53511279913572
<SOS> her crimes , i know them not ; her disorders , i know them not ; her vices , i know them not . <EOS>	85.91722515185918
<SOS> but this i know , that i had a mother , that five men leagued against one woman , murdered her clandestinely by night silently like cowards . <EOS>	66.8177258816093
<SOS> i know that you were one of them , my uncle , and that you cried louder than the others : 'she must die . ' <EOS>	83.24940571334967
<SOS> therefore i warn you , and listen well to my words , that they may be engraved upon your memory , never to be forgotten : this murder , which has robbed me of everything this murder , which has deprived me of my name this murder , which has impoverished me this murder , which has made me corrupt , wicked , implacable i shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices , when i discover them ! '' <EOS>	65.74727941551357
<SOS> with hatred in his eyes , foaming at his mouth , and his fist extended , mordaunt had advanced one more step , a threatening , terrible step , toward de winter . <EOS>	84.03617787338068
<SOS> the latter put his hand to his sword , and said , with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death : `` would you assassinate me , sir ? <EOS>	59.03074320000106
<SOS> then i shall recognize you as my nephew , for you would be a worthy son of such a mother . '' <EOS>	61.40899486381527
<SOS> `` no , '' replied mordaunt , forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm ; `` no , i shall not kill you ; at least not at this moment , for without you i could not discover the others . <EOS>	59.89536182197187
<SOS> but when i have found them , then tremble , sir . <EOS>	90.14740794520091
<SOS> i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune , without mercy or pity , and he was the least guilty of you all . '' <EOS>	41.568148352978525
<SOS> with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved ; then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony , leaning over the balustrade , waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room . <EOS>	44.11438248961574
<SOS> but de winter did not call ; crushed , enfeebled , he remained standing and with listening ear ; then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair , saying : `` my god , i thank thee that he knows me only . '' <EOS>	104.22706810465726

<SOS> whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter 's , athos , seated near his window , his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand , was listening intently to raoul 's account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle . <EOS>	76.8205620459859
<SOS> listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure , the fine , noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure ; he inhaled the tones of that young voice , as harmonious music . <EOS>	114.54100012317828
<SOS> he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future . <EOS>	46.5454389924197
<SOS> it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes . <EOS>	72.44097242914124
<SOS> athos was happy happy as he had never been before . <EOS>	48.828230280544126

<SOS> `` as calm as at parade , radiant as at a fete . <EOS>	101.8576927481763
<SOS> when we went up to the enemy it was slowly ; we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the spaniards , who were on a height with lowered muskets . <EOS>	88.82458467570599
<SOS> when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers : 'comrades , ' he said , 'you are about to suffer a furious discharge ; but after that you will make short work with those fellows . ' <EOS>	68.88902169891317
<SOS> there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words ; then raising his sword , 'sound trumpets ! ' <EOS>	75.23347528419053
<SOS> he cried . '' <EOS>	64.76273367047337
<SOS> `` well , very good ; you will do as much when the opportunity occurs , will you , raoul ? '' <EOS>	71.70780240062973
<SOS> `` i know not , sir , but i thought it really very fine and grand ! '' <EOS>	58.89608232397036
<SOS> `` were you afraid , raoul ? '' <EOS>	92.00501566632775
<SOS> asked the count . <EOS>	59.26116466943572
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the young man naively ; `` i felt a great chill at my heart , and at the word 'fire , ' which resounded in spanish from the enemy 's ranks , i closed my eyes and thought of you . '' <EOS>	45.97392165158856
<SOS> `` in honest truth , raoul ? '' <EOS>	62.24206583556293
<SOS> said athos , pressing his hand . <EOS>	73.0328975045041
<SOS> `` yes , sir ; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened . <EOS>	76.13195275180476
<SOS> those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames . <EOS>	101.1128416551305
<SOS> i opened my eyes , astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt ; a third of the squadron were lying on the ground , wounded , dead or dying . <EOS>	56.83059845192215
<SOS> at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince . <EOS>	70.63264453226381
<SOS> i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me . <EOS>	90.31626380220726
<SOS> i spurred on and found myself in the enemy 's ranks . '' <EOS>	56.83566955152756
<SOS> `` and the prince was pleased with you ? '' <EOS>	54.797132510989194
<SOS> `` he told me so , at least , sir , when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon , who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken . <EOS>	70.76200759048018
<SOS> 'go , ' said he ; 'the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service . <EOS>	55.10495358849281
<SOS> go and see those whom you love and who love you , and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you . ' <EOS>	55.49963390938904
<SOS> and i came , sir , '' added raoul , gazing at the count with a smile of real affection , `` for i thought you would be glad to see me again . '' <EOS>	49.06888770698758
<SOS> athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow , as he would have done to a young daughter . <EOS>	49.684149108596124
<SOS> `` and now , raoul , '' said he , `` you are launched ; you have dukes for friends , a marshal of france for godfather , a prince of the blood as commander , and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens ; it is not so bad for a novice . '' <EOS>	89.47878498649885
<SOS> `` oh sir , '' said raoul , suddenly , `` you recall something , which , in my haste to relate my exploits , i had forgotten ; it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england , a gentleman who , when i pronounced your name , uttered a cry of surprise and joy ; he said he was a friend of yours , asked your address , and is coming to see you . '' <EOS>	111.55629436086765
<SOS> `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	60.21693474622679
<SOS> `` i did not venture to ask , sir ; he spoke elegantly , although i thought from his accent he was an englishman . '' <EOS>	63.612665915939765
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	107.8214113683707
<SOS> said athos , leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be . <EOS>	63.13595050283756
<SOS> then , when he raised it again , he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air . <EOS>	69.9827836137364
<SOS> `` lord de winter ! '' <EOS>	50.05837233730592
<SOS> exclaimed the count . <EOS>	67.7916112934409
<SOS> `` athos , my friend ! '' <EOS>	118.63922961646597
<SOS> and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other 's arms ; then athos , looking into his friend 's face and taking him by both hands , said : `` what ails you , my lord ? <EOS>	56.76101243576838
<SOS> you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse . '' <EOS>	65.01652264274519
<SOS> `` yes , truly , dear friend ; and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay . '' <EOS>	89.74892174302965
<SOS> and de winter glancing around him , raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly . <EOS>	80.70169826522437
<SOS> `` come , now that we are alone , '' said athos , `` let us talk of yourself . '' <EOS>	68.71394447907832

<SOS> athos , again struck by this name , which seemed to pursue him like an echo , hesitated for a moment , then slightly knitting his brows , he calmly said : `` i know it , grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence . '' <EOS>	96.21246788845568
<SOS> `` does grimaud know him , then ? '' <EOS>	84.00221047239751

<SOS> `` what need you fear ? '' <EOS>	57.6932703892655
<SOS> said athos , recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced , by the aid of reason ; `` are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves ? <EOS>	96.10502190942356

<SOS> `` his hatred of the king , who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter . '' <EOS>	62.63803450868098

<SOS> everything is clear to me now . <EOS>	88.8833829969672
<SOS> adieu , count , till to morrow . '' <EOS>	67.50509760221367
<SOS> `` but the night is dark , '' said athos , perceiving that lord de winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear ; `` and you have no servant . '' <EOS>	55.60588589575195
<SOS> `` i have tony , a safe if simple youth . '' <EOS>	63.02237238544141
<SOS> `` halloo , there , grimaud , olivain , and blaisois ! <EOS>	88.21821929806069
<SOS> call the viscount and take the musket with you . '' <EOS>	83.91253345067013
<SOS> blaisois was the tall youth , half groom , half peasant , whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne , whom athos had christened by the name of his province . <EOS>	87.18541753468654
<SOS> `` viscount , '' said athos to raoul , as he entered , `` you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him . '' <EOS>	63.229760775800685
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	42.290926066451576
<SOS> count , '' said de winter , `` for whom do you take me ? '' <EOS>	53.93344415626824
<SOS> `` for a stranger who does not know paris , '' said athos , `` and to whom the viscount will show the way . '' <EOS>	66.94916841582493
<SOS> de winter shook him by the hand . <EOS>	100.42445336634563
<SOS> `` grimaud , '' said athos , `` put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk . '' <EOS>	69.18324577754858
<SOS> grimaud shuddered , and nodding , awaited the departure , regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence . <EOS>	92.95223621544808
<SOS> then obeying the orders given him by athos , he headed the small procession , bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other , until it reached de winter 's inn , when pounding on the portal with his fist , he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word . <EOS>	66.20413156420815
<SOS> the same order was followed in returning , nor did grimaud 's searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance , save a dark shadow , as it were , in ambuscade , at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai . <EOS>	93.06484713449463
<SOS> he fancied , also , that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention . <EOS>	69.77327374249388
<SOS> he pushed on toward him , but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley , into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it . <EOS>	63.00053163551492
<SOS> the next day , on awaking , the count perceived raoul by his bedside . <EOS>	55.013898704742395
<SOS> the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m. chapelain . <EOS>	61.98600699637083
<SOS> `` already up , raoul ? '' <EOS>	61.799830107894756
<SOS> exclaimed the count . <EOS>	67.46026182647846
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied raoul , with slight hesitation ; `` i did not sleep well . '' <EOS>	95.93503643374139
<SOS> `` you , raoul , not sleep well ! <EOS>	80.55277757530126
<SOS> then you must have something on your mind ! '' <EOS>	62.86874872949242
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	83.3653822568938
<SOS> `` sir , you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived , but `` `` have you only two days of leave , raoul ? '' <EOS>	71.86697793132562
<SOS> `` on the contrary , sir , i have ten ; nor is it to the camp i wish to go . '' <EOS>	69.87219487697627
<SOS> `` where , then ? '' <EOS>	48.28365633822605
<SOS> said athos , smiling , `` if it be not a secret . <EOS>	54.92657010589784
<SOS> you are now almost a man , since you have made your first passage of arms , and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me . '' <EOS>	84.47440070575014
<SOS> `` never , sir , '' said raoul , `` as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector , shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me . <EOS>	86.97600104687334
<SOS> i have , however , a wish to go and pass a day at blois . <EOS>	61.60915997072314
<SOS> you look at me and you are going to laugh at me . '' <EOS>	49.453479499017064
<SOS> `` no , on the contrary , i am not inclined to laugh , '' said athos , suppressing a sigh . <EOS>	63.24701235582608
<SOS> `` you wish to see blois again ; it is but natural . '' <EOS>	82.82283394029133
<SOS> `` then you permit me to go , you are not angry in your heart ? '' <EOS>	93.97217284898765
<SOS> exclaimed raoul , joyously . <EOS>	64.97717224777207
<SOS> `` certainly ; and why should i regret what gives you pleasure ? '' <EOS>	87.08976868704573
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	70.94711769857044
<SOS> how kind you are , '' exclaimed the young man , pressing his guardian 's hand ; `` and i can set out immediately ? '' <EOS>	90.10988882011887
<SOS> `` when you like , raoul . '' <EOS>	83.80998381429347
<SOS> `` sir , '' said raoul , as he turned to leave the room , `` i have thought of one thing , and that is about the duchess of chevreuse , who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince . '' <EOS>	55.545687044388494
<SOS> `` and you ought to thank her , raoul . <EOS>	59.148917220463204
<SOS> well , try the hotel de luynes , raoul , and ask if the duchess can receive you . <EOS>	54.01605730577571
<SOS> i am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world . <EOS>	65.60117081489766
<SOS> you must take grimaud and olivain . '' <EOS>	88.3045613262589
<SOS> `` both , sir ? '' <EOS>	50.267676062345444
<SOS> asked raoul , astonished . <EOS>	67.15362004005273
<SOS> `` both . '' <EOS>	60.38679202483881
<SOS> raoul went out , and when athos heard his young , joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain , he sighed . <EOS>	52.8652553744464
<SOS> `` it is very soon to leave me , '' he thought , `` but he follows the common custom . <EOS>	67.51644435952814
<SOS> nature has made us thus ; she makes the young look ever forward , not behind . <EOS>	84.72161645939839
<SOS> he certainly likes the child , but will he love me less as his affection grows for her ? '' <EOS>	93.95355122843755
<SOS> and athos confessed to himself that , he was unprepared for so prompt a departure ; but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian . <EOS>	64.5681470924284
<SOS> everything was ready at ten o'clock for the departure , and as athos was watching raoul mount , a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse . <EOS>	65.51939300989031
<SOS> he was charged to tell the comte de la fere , that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege , and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field , and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations . <EOS>	90.52799929444896
<SOS> `` tell her grace , '' replied athos , `` that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes . '' <EOS>	92.41356563157316
<SOS> then , with renewed instructions to grimaud , athos signified to raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment . <EOS>	58.85358578565104
<SOS> chapter xlii . <EOS>	72.2791679169657
<SOS> another queen in want of help . <EOS>	59.093116133192815
<SOS> athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois , the only serving man whom he had left . <EOS>	117.81830180561693
<SOS> blaisois found bazin donning his beadle 's gown , his services being required that day at notre dame . <EOS>	117.9278262542461
<SOS> athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself . <EOS>	109.89333271874122
<SOS> blaisois , a tall , simple youth , who understood nothing but what he was expressly told , asked , therefore for the abbé d'herblay , and in spite of bazin 's assurances that his master was not at home , he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion . <EOS>	62.56947695630207
<SOS> blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise , was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks , believing too , that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth , namely , patience and christian charity . <EOS>	88.92696656998254
<SOS> but bazin , still the servant of a musketeer , when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks , seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois , saying : `` you have insulted the church , my friend , you have insulted the church ! '' <EOS>	60.34096600684955
<SOS> at this moment aramis , aroused by this unusual disturbance , cautiously opened the door of his room ; and blaisois , looking reproachfully at the cerberus , drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis . <EOS>	85.40363512143041
<SOS> `` from the comte de la fere , '' said aramis . <EOS>	97.36552562217854
<SOS> `` all right . '' <EOS>	56.98359830272992
<SOS> and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise . <EOS>	54.7188467808156
<SOS> blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed , he related his adventure . <EOS>	95.1321661784981
<SOS> `` you foolish fellow ! '' <EOS>	59.84217949073076
<SOS> said athos , laughing . <EOS>	78.65420368689269
<SOS> `` and you did not tell him that you came from me ? '' <EOS>	90.35476983641469
<SOS> `` no , sir . '' <EOS>	105.5683501076078
<SOS> at ten o'clock athos , with his habitual exactitude , was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter . <EOS>	54.666642349902645
<SOS> they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them . <EOS>	77.38271659928151
<SOS> `` patience , '' said athos , whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac , `` patience ; i see an abbé cuffing a man , then bowing to a woman ; it must be aramis . '' <EOS>	96.80830904986946
<SOS> it was indeed aramis . <EOS>	45.44048684339759
<SOS> having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him , aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces . <EOS>	39.44398324073696
<SOS> at this moment one of his penitents passed , and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile . <EOS>	61.82550302942623
<SOS> a most affectionate greeting , as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter . <EOS>	68.63042088481347
<SOS> `` where are we going ? '' <EOS>	84.54985403383984
<SOS> inquired aramis ; `` are we going to fight , perchance ? <EOS>	88.16454627780242
<SOS> i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one . '' <EOS>	48.37998154076447
<SOS> `` no , '' said lord de winter , `` we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england . '' <EOS>	94.51484380247803
<SOS> `` oh , very well , '' replied aramis ; then bending his face down to athos 's ear , `` what is the object of this visit ? '' <EOS>	84.85447348923643
<SOS> continued he . <EOS>	84.88850099104766
<SOS> `` nay , i know not ; some evidence required from us , perhaps . '' <EOS>	67.25606161923707
<SOS> `` may it not be about that cursed affair ? '' <EOS>	86.31753847865778
<SOS> asked aramis , `` in which case i do not greatly care to go , for it will be to pocket a lecture ; and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself . '' <EOS>	89.62493792518212
<SOS> `` if it were so , '' answered athos , `` we should not be taken there by lord de winter , for he would come in for his share ; he was one of us . '' <EOS>	79.69430432823927
<SOS> `` you 're right ; yes , let us go . '' <EOS>	56.78231059431245
<SOS> on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first ; indeed , there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate . <EOS>	121.7976654005309
<SOS> it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos , aramis , and even the englishman . <EOS>	63.49396624577443
<SOS> large rooms , completely stripped of furniture , bare walls upon which , here and there , shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect , windows with broken panes ( impossible to close ) , no carpets , neither guards nor servants : this is what first met the eyes of athos , to which he , touching his companion 's elbow , directed his attention by his glances . <EOS>	53.01878712744978
<SOS> `` mazarin is better lodged , '' said aramis . <EOS>	73.59874761569127
<SOS> `` mazarin is almost king , '' answered athos ; `` madame henrietta is almost no longer queen . '' <EOS>	82.63580422447444
<SOS> `` if you would condescend to be clever , athos , '' observed aramis , `` i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture . '' <EOS>	92.95850381801326
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	91.7635183936423
<SOS> the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them , for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune . <EOS>	105.72340812496003
<SOS> `` enter . <EOS>	57.50462007019331
<SOS> you are welcome , gentlemen , '' she said . <EOS>	77.72375704364188
<SOS> the gentlemen entered and remained standing , but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves . <EOS>	103.09109593803886
<SOS> athos was calm and grave , but aramis was furious ; the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself . <EOS>	105.65586598382595
<SOS> `` you are examining the luxury i enjoy , '' said the queen , glancing sadly around her . <EOS>	67.99694221649811
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied aramis , `` i must ask your pardon , but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv . <EOS>	108.49601137283697
<SOS> is treated at the court of france . '' <EOS>	62.975651400567294
<SOS> `` monsieur aramis is not an officer ? '' <EOS>	95.00196018483469
<SOS> asked the queen of lord de winter . <EOS>	84.39433908925263
<SOS> `` that gentleman is the abbé d'herblay , '' replied he . <EOS>	58.87830403363536
<SOS> aramis blushed . <EOS>	96.59789688636485
<SOS> `` madame , '' he said , `` i am an abbé , it is true , but i am so against my will . <EOS>	71.40394625842936
<SOS> i never had a vocation for the bands ; my cassock is fastened by one button only , and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more . <EOS>	93.75252975361431
<SOS> this morning , being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty , i encumbered myself with this dress , but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty 's service , in whatever way you may see fit to use me . '' <EOS>	78.07765066821473
<SOS> `` the abbé d'herblay , '' resumed de winter , `` is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii. , of whom i have spoken to you , madame . '' <EOS>	70.96882925984016
<SOS> then turning to athos , he continued , `` and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere , whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty . '' <EOS>	69.3982601810777
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the queen , `` a few years ago i had around me ushers , treasures , armies ; and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service . <EOS>	82.67459692464016
<SOS> to day , look around you , and it may astonish you , that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter , the friend of twenty years , and you , gentlemen , whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen . '' <EOS>	95.65673647301253
<SOS> `` it is enough , '' said athos , bowing low , `` if the lives of three men can purchase yours , madame . '' <EOS>	70.17493009043692
<SOS> `` i thank you , gentlemen . <EOS>	90.21083044024749
<SOS> but hear me , '' continued she . <EOS>	63.525589812702925
<SOS> `` i am not only the most miserable of queens , but the most unhappy of mothers , the most wretched of wives . <EOS>	98.48444787835224
<SOS> my children , two of them , at least , the duke of york and the princess elizabeth , are far away from me , exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes ; my husband , the king , is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired . <EOS>	67.31800446573655
<SOS> hold ! <EOS>	51.743558812829626
<SOS> gentlemen , here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter . <EOS>	43.630120193068734
<SOS> read it . '' <EOS>	74.43963060521648
<SOS> obeying the queen , athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen , in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him . <EOS>	63.643512837246824
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	94.14278765932967
<SOS> asked athos , when he had closed the letter . <EOS>	77.77378002605454
<SOS> `` well , '' said the queen , `` it has been refused . '' <EOS>	97.03831034655646
<SOS> the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt . <EOS>	47.47886237039777
<SOS> `` and now , '' said athos , `` what is to be done ? <EOS>	73.47399111182683
<SOS> i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d'herblay and myself to do in your service . <EOS>	88.3656164777561
<SOS> we are ready . '' <EOS>	44.777786520490864
<SOS> `` ah , sir , you have a noble heart ! '' <EOS>	82.44943969643074
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , with a burst of gratitude ; whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said , `` did i not answer for them ? '' <EOS>	52.42147769559435
<SOS> `` but you , sir ? '' <EOS>	64.67431972788441
<SOS> said the queen to aramis . <EOS>	72.38620862840916
<SOS> `` i , madame , '' replied he , `` follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads , even were it on to death , without demanding wherefore ; but when it concerns your majesty 's service , then , '' added he , looking at the queen with all the grace of former days , `` i precede the count . '' <EOS>	75.75212958181562
<SOS> `` well , then , gentlemen , '' said the queen , `` since it is thus , and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned , this is what is required to be done for me . <EOS>	85.6694831702489
<SOS> the king is alone with a few gentlemen , whom he fears to lose every day ; surrounded by the scotch , whom he distrusts , although he be himself a scotchman . <EOS>	49.63121310651483
<SOS> since lord de winter left him i am distracted , sirs . <EOS>	94.21888041883948
<SOS> i ask much , too much , perhaps , for i have no title to request it . <EOS>	44.18037189262498
<SOS> go to england , join the king , be his friends , protectors , march to battle at his side , and be near him in his house , where conspiracies , more dangerous than the perils of war , are hatching every day . <EOS>	57.92906823150557
<SOS> and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make , gentlemen , i promise not to reward you , i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister , to prefer you , next to my husband and my children , to every one . <EOS>	58.21885780549038
<SOS> i swear it before heaven . '' <EOS>	75.8080365381683
<SOS> and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward . <EOS>	62.127521350095876
<SOS> `` madame , '' said athos , `` when must we set out ? '' <EOS>	49.53872149849858
<SOS> `` you consent then ? '' <EOS>	81.2479101839861
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , joyfully . <EOS>	63.55925175576649
<SOS> `` yes , madame ; only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit . <EOS>	80.00594811850532
<SOS> we render service to god , madame , in serving a prince so unfortunate , a queen so virtuous . <EOS>	63.443474468222476
<SOS> madame , we are yours , body and soul . '' <EOS>	68.05812300333199
<SOS> `` oh , sirs , '' said the queen , moved even to tears , `` this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope . <EOS>	83.93537746779594
<SOS> god , who can read my heart , all the gratitude i feel , will reward you ! <EOS>	82.5166024732422
<SOS> save my husband ! <EOS>	71.1374862050355
<SOS> save the king , and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world , leave me the hope that we shall meet again , when i may be able to thank you myself . <EOS>	104.50982541170875
<SOS> in the meantime , i remain here . <EOS>	105.30489107240743
<SOS> have you anything to ask of me ? <EOS>	66.45644198508302
<SOS> from this moment i become your friend , and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours . '' <EOS>	64.30887593066036
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied athos , `` i have only to ask your majesty 's prayers . '' <EOS>	81.41049391350893
<SOS> `` and i , '' said aramis , `` i am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve . '' <EOS>	72.92656000467825
<SOS> the queen held out her hand , which they kissed , and she said in a low tone to de winter : `` if you need money , my lord , separate the jewels i have given you ; detach the diamonds and sell them to some jew . <EOS>	41.05576055437883
<SOS> you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs ; spend them if necessary , but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve , that is to say , like kings . '' <EOS>	108.6910060358175
<SOS> the queen had two letters ready , one written by herself , the other by her daughter , the princess henrietta . <EOS>	38.58680528677268
<SOS> both were addressed to king charles . <EOS>	112.0676688295202
<SOS> she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis , so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king ; after which they withdrew . <EOS>	52.93478345424831
<SOS> at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped . <EOS>	112.41229666537383
<SOS> `` not to arouse suspicions , gentlemen , '' said he , `` go your way and i will go mine , and this evening at nine o'clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis . <EOS>	57.88396540865983
<SOS> we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post . <EOS>	83.12603685605949
<SOS> once more , let me thank you , my good friends , both in my own name and the queen 's . '' <EOS>	78.70376127165002
<SOS> the three gentlemen then shook hands , lord de winter taking the rue saint honore , and athos and aramis remaining together . <EOS>	68.38687754597238
<SOS> `` well , '' said aramis , when they were alone , `` what do you think of this business , my dear count ? '' <EOS>	85.9108056451532
<SOS> `` bad , '' replied athos , `` very bad . '' <EOS>	70.061762829834
<SOS> `` but you received it with enthusiasm . '' <EOS>	83.83848965196711
<SOS> `` as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle , my dear d'herblay . <EOS>	70.13001002889925
<SOS> monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy , but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs . <EOS>	85.01518783056704
<SOS> let us , then , support monarchy , in order to support ourselves . <EOS>	55.98336370183637
<SOS> `` we shall be murdered there , '' said aramis . <EOS>	62.35333958993385
<SOS> `` i hate the english they are coarse , like every nation that swills beer . '' <EOS>	73.40477325309278
<SOS> `` would it be better to remain here , '' said athos , `` and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort ? <EOS>	74.46723298093082
<SOS> i'faith , aramis , believe me , there is little left to regret . <EOS>	55.550060754213405
<SOS> we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes ; the choice is easy . '' <EOS>	81.3139918270237
<SOS> `` it is true ; but in everything , friend , one must always return to the same question a stupid one , i admit , but very necessary have you any money ? '' <EOS>	82.76485955724137
<SOS> `` something like a hundred pistoles , that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne ; but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoul a young man must live respectably . <EOS>	101.00796697123808
<SOS> i have then about fifty pistoles . <EOS>	62.3734058052151

<SOS> `` as for me , i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home . <EOS>	49.09668254269305
<SOS> fortunately lord de winter is rich . '' <EOS>	85.1001333605377
<SOS> `` lord de winter is ruined for the moment ; oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources . '' <EOS>	74.0443494452446
<SOS> `` now is the time when baron porthos would be useful . '' <EOS>	88.73661548414225
<SOS> `` now it is that i regret d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	93.90588289560294
<SOS> `` let us entice them away . '' <EOS>	64.69003389282709
<SOS> `` this secret , aramis , does not belong to us ; take my advice , then , and let no one into our confidence . <EOS>	87.43768880042049
<SOS> and moreover , in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves . <EOS>	92.07943658686891
<SOS> let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes , but not speak of it . '' <EOS>	83.67145802962658
<SOS> `` you are right ; but what are you going to do until this evening ? <EOS>	52.76936256531791
<SOS> i have two things to postpone . '' <EOS>	105.38950877565128
<SOS> `` and what are they ? '' <EOS>	58.18997349856339
<SOS> `` first , a thrust with the coadjutor , whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet 's and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me . '' <EOS>	79.1154799922533
<SOS> `` oh , fie a quarrel between priests , a duel between allies ! '' <EOS>	87.57935708335283
<SOS> `` what can i do , friend ? <EOS>	71.00904259938824
<SOS> he is a bully and so am i ; his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine ; in fact , there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor . <EOS>	61.7158350442049
<SOS> this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me ; besides , he is a turbulent fellow , who will ruin our party . <EOS>	96.79342940060393
<SOS> i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear , such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me , it would change the appearance of things . '' <EOS>	74.16887894111171
<SOS> `` and i , my dear aramis , '' quietly replied athos , `` i think it would only change monsieur de retz 's appearance . <EOS>	63.718315936570676
<SOS> take my advice , leave things just as they are ; besides , you are neither of you now your own masters ; he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england . <EOS>	64.19491061686462
<SOS> so , if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first `` `` oh ! <EOS>	74.0961767109682
<SOS> that is of the first importance . '' <EOS>	55.23670537309343
<SOS> `` attend to it , then , at once . '' <EOS>	94.84377492223379
<SOS> `` unfortunately , it is a thing that i ca n't perform at any time i choose . <EOS>	68.11639502843377
<SOS> it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve . '' <EOS>	74.33635735821427
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said athos smiling , `` midnight . '' <EOS>	81.14062814155957
<SOS> `` about that time . '' <EOS>	80.65669635653843
<SOS> `` but , my dear fellow , those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off , especially with so good an excuse to give on your return `` `` yes , if i return . '' <EOS>	63.33147313412142
<SOS> `` if you do not return , how does it concern you ? <EOS>	83.44647996657527
<SOS> be reasonable . <EOS>	69.63699259386145

<SOS> `` yes , '' said athos , `` doubtless you would commit great follies ! <EOS>	114.35641167880847
<SOS> but now we must part . <EOS>	65.83912723575114
<SOS> i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write . <EOS>	55.843287181273226
<SOS> call for me at eight o'clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven ? '' <EOS>	87.27536990606662
<SOS> `` that will do very well , '' said aramis . <EOS>	66.81856917937655
<SOS> `` i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write . '' <EOS>	105.1421956921233
<SOS> they then separated . <EOS>	72.61127933157587
<SOS> athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome , left his name at madame de chevreuse 's and wrote the following letter to d'artagnan : `` dear friend , i am about to set off with aramis on important business . <EOS>	67.79449712866551
<SOS> i wished to make my adieux to you , but time does not permit . <EOS>	78.14091040077558
<SOS> remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish . <EOS>	104.02586263532368
<SOS> `` raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure ; watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can ; and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence , tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois , of which i send you now the key . <EOS>	93.67787033568399
<SOS> `` embrace porthos from aramis and myself . <EOS>	84.57193617358573
<SOS> adieu , perhaps farewell . '' <EOS>	75.70398580337515
<SOS> at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived ; he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw . <EOS>	59.65223604485074
<SOS> `` by the bye , '' he said , `` i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus , without leaving a line for porthos and d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	66.3704649546147
<SOS> `` the thing is done , dear friend , '' said athos ; `` i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself . '' <EOS>	117.71158194784294
<SOS> `` you are a wonderful man , my dear count , '' said aramis ; `` you think of everything . '' <EOS>	49.192868213745186
<SOS> `` well , have you made up your mind to this journey ? '' <EOS>	58.677333131688364
<SOS> `` quite ; and now that i reflect about it , i am glad to leave paris at this moment . '' <EOS>	110.17565636905077
<SOS> `` and so am i , '' replied athos ; `` my only regret is not having seen d'artagnan ; but the rascal is so cunning , he might have guessed our project . '' <EOS>	96.3222492574158
<SOS> when supper was over blaisois entered . <EOS>	98.51253496199371
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he , `` here is monsieur d'artagnan 's answer . '' <EOS>	60.750013095770385
<SOS> `` but i did not tell you there would be an answer , stupid ! '' <EOS>	71.28229635761603
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	67.84571965031768
<SOS> `` and i set off without waiting for one , but he called me back and gave me this ; '' and he presented a little leather bag , plump and giving out a golden jingle . <EOS>	81.73323715438848
<SOS> athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note , written in these terms : `` my dear count , when one travels , and especially for three months , one never has a superfluity of money . <EOS>	57.79262977562694
<SOS> now , recalling former times of mutual distress , i send you half my purse ; it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat . <EOS>	110.42500828816421

<SOS> athos smiled , and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear . <EOS>	60.56761436037222
<SOS> d'artagnan , who had loved him so tenderly , loved him still , although a mazarinist . <EOS>	95.15359941622826

<SOS> `` all right ; i am glad to see you are of my opinion . <EOS>	90.43298519057426
<SOS> there now , shall we start ? '' <EOS>	63.117301623777536
<SOS> `` when you like ; but have you no groom ? '' <EOS>	54.88258174441549
<SOS> `` no ; that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger , as you know , and therefore can not leave notre dame . <EOS>	93.42650776996611
<SOS> `` very well , take blaisois , with whom i know not what to do , since i already have grimaud . '' <EOS>	60.322039999443355
<SOS> `` willingly , '' said aramis . <EOS>	67.73613836576023
<SOS> at this moment grimaud appeared at the door . <EOS>	47.54133708368133
<SOS> `` ready , '' said he , with his usual curtness . <EOS>	87.15228888237876
<SOS> `` let us go , then , '' said athos . <EOS>	81.85510865495297
<SOS> the two friends mounted , as did their servants . <EOS>	41.34051863466636
<SOS> at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin , who was running breathlessly . <EOS>	66.15934056075116
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	88.20369422853507
<SOS> exclaimed he , `` thank heaven i have arrived in time . <EOS>	76.43096737603854
<SOS> monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you , saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left . '' <EOS>	95.98827564715019
<SOS> `` good , '' said aramis , taking a purse which bazin presented to him . <EOS>	78.0296012969607
<SOS> `` what is this ? '' <EOS>	63.868849131160545
<SOS> `` wait , your reverence , there is a letter . '' <EOS>	42.2379460246374
<SOS> `` you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body . <EOS>	42.381895069683964
<SOS> give me the letter . '' <EOS>	49.65449537001293
<SOS> `` how can you read ? '' <EOS>	49.95467278189298
<SOS> asked athos , `` it is as dark as a cold oven . '' <EOS>	77.81328866503898
<SOS> `` wait , '' said bazin , striking a flint , and setting afire a twisted wax light , with which he started the church candles . <EOS>	78.6189834547492
<SOS> thus illumined , aramis read the following epistle : `` my dear d'herblay , i learned from d'artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself , that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months ; as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord . <EOS>	96.6026101102311
<SOS> here are two hundred pistoles , which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs . <EOS>	78.38786748391689
<SOS> do not fear that you put me to inconvenience ; if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux ; at bracieux alone , i have twenty thousand francs in gold . <EOS>	59.540580888062344
<SOS> so , if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum . <EOS>	45.97304245763368
<SOS> `` i address you , because you know , that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere ; but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time . <EOS>	81.79649753829081
<SOS> `` i am , as i trust you do not doubt , your devoted `` du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds . '' <EOS>	80.25013915244784
<SOS> `` well , '' said aramis , `` what do you say to that ? '' <EOS>	86.59024345862784
<SOS> `` i say , my dear d'herblay , that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends , and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos , as we divided the louis sent by d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	52.76922525866787
<SOS> the division being made by the light of bazin 's taper , the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis . <EOS>	81.44059828644725
<SOS> chapter xliii . <EOS>	77.34829618767412
<SOS> in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best . <EOS>	112.40846556342919
<SOS> the three gentlemen took the road to picardy , a road so well known to them and which recalled to athos and aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth . <EOS>	62.20895975499513
<SOS> `` if mousqueton were with us , '' observed athos , on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers , `` how he would tremble at passing this ! <EOS>	96.12888293785826
<SOS> do you remember , aramis , that it was here he received that famous bullet wound ? '' <EOS>	47.19297199706881
<SOS> `` by my faith , 'twould be excusable in him to tremble , '' replied aramis , `` for even i feel a shudder at the recollection ; hold , just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed . '' <EOS>	52.867848286234384
<SOS> it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past . <EOS>	56.225031402364706
<SOS> arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast , he approached athos and said , showing him the airhole of the cellar : `` sausages ! '' <EOS>	61.16202804114153
<SOS> athos began to laugh , for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person . <EOS>	56.99188886078838
<SOS> at last , after traveling two days and a night , they arrived at boulogne toward the evening , favored by magnificent weather . <EOS>	70.3104758331619
<SOS> boulogne was a strong position , then almost a deserted town , built entirely on the heights ; what is now called the lower town did not then exist . <EOS>	43.46438320049346
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said de winter , on reaching the gate of the town , `` let us do here as at paris let us separate to avoid suspicion . <EOS>	90.98063203228378
<SOS> i know an inn , little frequented , but of which the host is entirely devoted to me . <EOS>	64.0037600909199
<SOS> i will go there , where i expect to find letters , and you go to the first tavern in the town , to l'epee du grand henri for instance , refresh yourselves , and in two hours be upon the jetty ; our boat is waiting for us there . '' <EOS>	62.07494859425977
<SOS> the matter being thus decided , the two friends found , about two hundred paces further , the tavern indicated . <EOS>	78.87990617947214
<SOS> their horses were fed , but not unsaddled ; the grooms supped , for it was already late , and their two masters , impatient to return , appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one . <EOS>	86.68571745483986
<SOS> it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alone long enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud . <EOS>	55.30031843538267
<SOS> athos and aramis walked down toward the port . <EOS>	94.50320281786584
<SOS> from their dress , covered with dust , and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable , the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders . <EOS>	69.6363012036729
<SOS> there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression . <EOS>	95.88980683888742
<SOS> this man , whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others , was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty . <EOS>	64.20475013784315
<SOS> from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them . <EOS>	64.29883730824399
<SOS> on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start . <EOS>	62.343174409955466
<SOS> `` that is doubtless our boat , '' said athos . <EOS>	71.38101501144516
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied aramis , `` and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination ; now , '' continued he , `` if only de winter does not keep us waiting . <EOS>	61.46294527989587
<SOS> it is not at all amusing here ; there is not a single woman passing . '' <EOS>	54.82334195410679
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	84.1980174799593
<SOS> said athos , `` we are overheard . '' <EOS>	47.04757466948452
<SOS> in truth , the walker , who , during the observations of the two friends , had passed and repassed behind them several times , stopped at the name of de winter ; but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name , it might have been by chance he stood so still . <EOS>	52.90062958187815
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the man , who was young and pale , bowing with ease and courtesy , `` pardon my curiosity , but i see you come from paris , or at least that you are strangers at boulogne . '' <EOS>	82.5969634360385
<SOS> `` we come from paris , yes , '' replied athos , with the same courtesy ; `` what is there we can do for you ? '' <EOS>	68.42203145082631
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the young man , `` will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister ? '' <EOS>	56.28455285210749
<SOS> `` that is a strange question , '' said aramis . <EOS>	88.01276408491206
<SOS> `` he is and he is not , '' replied athos ; `` that is to say , he is dismissed by one half of france , but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him ; you will perceive that this may last a long time . '' <EOS>	81.11363062477761
<SOS> `` however , sir , '' said the stranger , `` he has neither fled nor is in prison ? '' <EOS>	107.37282883064012
<SOS> `` no , sir , not at this moment at least . '' <EOS>	65.47096291118869
<SOS> `` sirs , accept my thanks for your politeness , '' said the young man , retreating . <EOS>	71.30786323908322
<SOS> `` what do you think of that interrogator ? '' <EOS>	55.42665593951672
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	66.0506850947562
<SOS> `` i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information . '' <EOS>	64.7639522645192
<SOS> `` and you replied to him with that notion ? '' <EOS>	106.64638634558528
<SOS> `` nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise ; he was polite to me and i was so to him . '' <EOS>	75.44873176034478
<SOS> `` but if he be a spy `` `` what do you think a spy would be about here ? <EOS>	79.80674861708941
<SOS> we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu , who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion . '' <EOS>	44.67920933816916
<SOS> `` it matters not ; you were wrong to reply to him as you did , '' continued aramis , following with his eyes the young man , now vanishing behind the cliffs . <EOS>	75.81586181609086
<SOS> `` and you , '' said athos , `` you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter 's name . <EOS>	91.0025073803668
<SOS> did you not see that at that name the young man stopped ? '' <EOS>	65.6941124448938
<SOS> `` more reason , then , when he spoke to you , for sending him about his business . '' <EOS>	70.33960601981339
<SOS> `` a quarrel ? '' <EOS>	99.19954262499971
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	78.91478142417434
<SOS> `` and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel ? '' <EOS>	66.87622011263997
<SOS> `` i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it . <EOS>	75.38970409276072
<SOS> besides , let me own something to you . <EOS>	83.6172392146336
<SOS> i am anxious to see that young man nearer . '' <EOS>	67.44328766103975
<SOS> `` and wherefore ? '' <EOS>	48.886232716388555
<SOS> `` aramis , you will certainly laugh at me , you will say that i am always repeating the same thing , you will call me the most timorous of visionaries ; but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man ? '' <EOS>	80.53271103435407
<SOS> `` in beauty or on the contrary ? '' <EOS>	99.87048143371699
<SOS> asked aramis , laughing . <EOS>	93.50080794430149
<SOS> `` in ugliness , in so far as a man can resemble a woman . '' <EOS>	68.88110022713917
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	80.22862928466527
<SOS> egad ! '' <EOS>	63.29222699861839
<SOS> cried aramis , `` you set me thinking . <EOS>	99.49832995803587
<SOS> no , in truth you are no visionary , my dear friend , and now i think of it you yes , i'faith , you 're right those delicate , yet firm set lips , those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart ! <EOS>	74.7422985589364
<SOS> yes , it is one of milady 's bastards ! '' <EOS>	72.78551547625077
<SOS> `` you laugh aramis . '' <EOS>	82.84710689010136
<SOS> `` from habit , that is all . <EOS>	82.58052773838638
<SOS> i swear to you , i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path . '' <EOS>	99.26044451902517
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	89.14563684440787
<SOS> here is de winter coming , '' said athos . <EOS>	63.04947682438537
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	74.00877038360449
<SOS> one thing now is only awanting and that is , that our grooms should not keep us waiting . '' <EOS>	48.62658332196103
<SOS> `` no , '' said athos . <EOS>	94.89442016246778
<SOS> `` i see them about twenty paces behind my lord . <EOS>	76.2988443638417
<SOS> i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch . <EOS>	76.22912689412566
<SOS> tony carries our muskets . '' <EOS>	75.4274715829299
<SOS> `` then we set sail to night ? '' <EOS>	64.15019544030419
<SOS> asked aramis , glancing toward the west , where the sun had left a single golden cloud , which , dipping into the ocean , appeared by degrees to be extinguished . <EOS>	86.29639187450603
<SOS> `` probably , '' said athos . <EOS>	109.48368229837595
<SOS> `` diable ! '' <EOS>	68.43725523990268
<SOS> resumed aramis , `` i have little fancy for the sea by day , still less at night ; the sounds of wind and wave , the frightful movements of the vessel ; i confess i prefer the convent of noisy . '' <EOS>	76.44033467052583
<SOS> athos smiled sadly , for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter . <EOS>	48.037611026319546
<SOS> `` what ails our friend ? '' <EOS>	75.70799433325425
<SOS> said aramis , `` he resembles one of dante 's damned , whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels . <EOS>	81.09804728949175
<SOS> what the devil makes him glower thus behind him ? '' <EOS>	110.10390420868055
<SOS> when de winter perceived them , in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity . <EOS>	73.3523842101174
<SOS> `` what is the matter , my lord ? '' <EOS>	68.61738348054581
<SOS> said athos , `` and what puts you out of breath thus ? '' <EOS>	78.29067067155314
<SOS> `` nothing , '' replied de winter ; `` nothing ; and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me `` and he again turned round . <EOS>	65.19780372537952
<SOS> athos glanced at aramis . <EOS>	97.74468375540151
<SOS> `` but let us go , '' continued de winter ; `` let us be off ; the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there ? <EOS>	72.92581492193567
<SOS> i wish i were on board already , '' and he looked back again . <EOS>	68.10197416941146
<SOS> `` he has seen him , '' said athos , in a low tone , to aramis . <EOS>	115.45551413197038
<SOS> they had reached the ladder which led to the boat . <EOS>	66.69293017342557
<SOS> de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them . <EOS>	106.64238482900561
<SOS> at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty , and hastening his steps , as if to reach the other side of the port , scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking . <EOS>	66.03770942460795
<SOS> he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him . <EOS>	50.68797659755406
<SOS> athos now descended the ladder in his turn , without losing sight of the young man . <EOS>	42.279671299989204
<SOS> the latter , to make a short cut , had appeared on a sluice . <EOS>	77.93359158676873
<SOS> `` he certainly bodes us no good , '' said athos ; `` but let us embark ; once out at sea , let him come . '' <EOS>	82.03532700091097
<SOS> and athos sprang into the boat , which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers . <EOS>	99.09011953152584
<SOS> but the young man had begun to follow , or rather to advance before the boat . <EOS>	55.153984690731
<SOS> she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty , surmounted by a beacon just lighted , and a rock which jutted out . <EOS>	69.738990141858
<SOS> they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed . <EOS>	64.2022612117595
<SOS> `` ay , but , '' said aramis , `` that young fellow is decidedly a spy . '' <EOS>	110.69004180351111
<SOS> `` which is the young man ? '' <EOS>	94.84312592124216
<SOS> asked de winter , turning around . <EOS>	74.29601557172184
<SOS> `` he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there ; behold ! '' <EOS>	61.841046153093885
<SOS> de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis 's finger . <EOS>	46.21452308568325
<SOS> the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms . <EOS>	42.59104077815764
<SOS> `` it is he ! '' <EOS>	124.14508271844316
<SOS> exclaimed de winter , seizing the arm of athos ; `` it is he ! <EOS>	67.07845875011249
<SOS> i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken . '' <EOS>	86.58385800490663
<SOS> `` whom do you mean ? '' <EOS>	93.95917655252494
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	102.61005918305975
<SOS> `` milady 's son , '' replied athos . <EOS>	61.051828023807275
<SOS> `` the monk ! '' <EOS>	109.76110899724178
<SOS> exclaimed grimaud . <EOS>	87.71446348738999
<SOS> the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it . <EOS>	50.066979248515366
<SOS> `` yes , it is i , my uncle i , the son of milady i , the monk i , the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now , both you and your companions . '' <EOS>	118.97980526445068
<SOS> in that boat sat three men , unquestionably brave , whose courage no man would have dared dispute ; nevertheless , at that voice , that accent and those gestures , they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins . <EOS>	68.11896680910034
<SOS> as for grimaud , his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow . <EOS>	69.72343618322572
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	122.39536452235575
<SOS> exclaimed aramis , `` that is the nephew , the monk , and the son of milady , as he says himself . '' <EOS>	73.21823976963111
<SOS> `` alas , yes , '' murmured de winter . <EOS>	76.38095088920049
<SOS> `` then wait , '' said aramis ; and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed , he took one of the muskets from tony , shouldered and aimed it at the young man , who stood , like the accusing angel , upon the rock . <EOS>	63.23089079457213
<SOS> `` fire ! '' <EOS>	82.80722647868286
<SOS> cried grimaud , unconsciously . <EOS>	85.62932252852859
<SOS> athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired . <EOS>	54.54021019574912
<SOS> `` the devil take you , '' said aramis . <EOS>	76.85329082931689
<SOS> `` i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast . '' <EOS>	69.16931780411092
<SOS> `` it is enough to have killed the mother , '' said athos , hoarsely . <EOS>	60.368283499616176
<SOS> `` the mother was a wretch , who struck at us all and at those dear to us . '' <EOS>	72.9368600892635
<SOS> `` yes , but the son has done us no harm . '' <EOS>	76.38750957615775
<SOS> grimaud , who had risen to watch the effect of the shot , fell back hopeless , wringing his hands . <EOS>	66.61260184288601
<SOS> the young man burst into a laugh . <EOS>	98.48147097642756
<SOS> `` ah , it is certainly you ! '' <EOS>	42.35468609919519
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	45.20789310553151
<SOS> `` i know you even better now . '' <EOS>	93.50463500075439
<SOS> his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads , carried by the breeze , until lost in the depths of the horizon . <EOS>	72.48477799394007
<SOS> aramis shuddered . <EOS>	62.37097379966655
<SOS> `` be calm , '' exclaimed athos , `` for heaven 's sake ! <EOS>	48.792713119151294
<SOS> have we ceased to be men ? '' <EOS>	85.72208605983454
<SOS> `` no , '' said aramis , `` but that fellow is a fiend ; and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew . '' <EOS>	54.00089687104643
<SOS> de winter only replied by a groan . <EOS>	87.61845588256696
<SOS> `` it was all up with him , '' continued aramis ; `` ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly . '' <EOS>	76.96279681011043
<SOS> athos took lord de winter 's hand and tried to turn the conversation . <EOS>	74.293907720771
<SOS> `` when shall we land in england ? '' <EOS>	77.30263847062113
<SOS> he asked ; but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply . <EOS>	58.57803614399005
<SOS> `` hold , athos , '' said aramis , `` perhaps there is yet time . <EOS>	93.9559215114691
<SOS> see if he is still in the same place . '' <EOS>	74.9604362751494
<SOS> athos turned around with an effort ; the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him , and there he still was , in fact , on the rock , the beacon shedding around him , as it were , a doubtful aureole . <EOS>	55.02940954303091
<SOS> `` decidedly , aramis , '' said athos , `` i think i was wrong not to let you fire . '' <EOS>	68.01842961692144
<SOS> `` hold your tongue , '' replied aramis ; `` you would make me weep , if such a thing were possible . '' <EOS>	83.48989662545054
<SOS> at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men , servants and baggage were aboard . <EOS>	109.10210847110892
<SOS> the captain was only waiting for his passengers ; hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings , where they were to disembark . <EOS>	79.42944679678304
<SOS> at this instant the three friends turned , in spite of themselves , a last look on the rock , upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still . <EOS>	81.54752777673035
<SOS> then a voice reached them once more , sending this threat : `` to our next meeting , sirs , in england . '' <EOS>	66.34288815051272
<SOS> chapter xliv . <EOS>	47.06810411544582
<SOS> te deum for the victory of lens . <EOS>	109.65440994530024
<SOS> the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason , was occasioned by the battle of lens , announced by the prince 's messenger , the duc de chatillon , who had taken such a noble part in the engagement ; he was , besides , charged to hang five and twenty flags , taken from the lorraine party , as well as from the spaniards , upon the arches of notre dame . <EOS>	83.6912383384906
<SOS> such news was decisive ; it destroyed , in favor of the court , the struggle commenced with parliament . <EOS>	62.204846407050105
<SOS> the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition , was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy . <EOS>	63.11604332629177
<SOS> now , since the affair of nordlingen , they had experienced nothing but reverses ; the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories , always promised , ever deferred ; but this time there really had been fighting , a triumph and a complete one . <EOS>	59.65682783255893
<SOS> and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court , a victory at home and abroad ; so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed , `` ah , gentlemen of the parliament , we shall see what you will say now ! '' <EOS>	95.15378057919978
<SOS> upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart , whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own . <EOS>	62.949827629001035
<SOS> a council was called on the same evening , but nothing transpired of what had been decided on . <EOS>	71.10940919942293
<SOS> it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens . <EOS>	55.7506080957668
<SOS> the following sunday , then , the parisians arose with joy ; at that period a te deum was a grand affair ; this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect . <EOS>	69.46541127294446
<SOS> the shops were deserted , houses closed ; every one wished to see the young king with his mother , and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence . <EOS>	71.0864271604747
<SOS> moreover , great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd ; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused , so to speak , of coming insurrection , as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum . <EOS>	82.81529302426338
<SOS> the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself , nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips . <EOS>	70.83005570828749
<SOS> nevertheless , at eight o'clock in the morning the regiment of the queen 's guards , commanded by guitant , under whom was his nephew comminges , marched publicly , preceded by drums and trumpets , filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame , a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly , delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms . <EOS>	53.02211873613181
<SOS> friquet had put on his sunday clothes , under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth , and had procured a whole holiday from bazin . <EOS>	107.43028994274434
<SOS> on leaving bazin , friquet started off to the palais royal , where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards ; and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music , he took his place at their head , beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet , which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony . <EOS>	58.153812006303355
<SOS> this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame , and friquet found in it very real enjoyment ; but when at last the regiment separated , penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe , near the rue cocatrix , in which broussel lived , then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast ; and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day , he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast . <EOS>	66.37414236201718
<SOS> in consequence he took to his heels , arrived breathlessly at the councillor 's door , and knocked violently . <EOS>	70.41997242681535
<SOS> his mother , the councillor 's old servant , opened it . <EOS>	60.46605161487938
<SOS> `` what doest thou here , good for nothing ? '' <EOS>	64.05197475939423
<SOS> she said , `` and why art thou not at notre dame ? '' <EOS>	69.30787465785893
<SOS> `` i have been there , mother , '' said friquet , `` but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned , and so with monsieur bazin 's permission you know , mother , monsieur bazin , the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel . '' <EOS>	85.60117258607201
<SOS> `` and what hast thou to say , boy , to monsieur broussel ? '' <EOS>	60.3206874046919
<SOS> `` i wish to tell him , '' replied friquet , screaming with all his might , `` that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way . <EOS>	86.02840033392192
<SOS> and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him , i wish to warn him , that he may be on his guard . '' <EOS>	106.37514203203854
<SOS> broussel heard the scream of the young oddity , and , enchanted with this excess of zeal , came down to the first floor , for he was , in truth , working in his room on the second . <EOS>	75.92002645450279
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , `` friend , what matters the regiment of guards to us , and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance ? <EOS>	58.47912396095963
<SOS> knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by ? '' <EOS>	57.02958497439389
<SOS> friquet counterfeited surprise , and twisting his new cap around in his fingers , said : `` it is not astonishing for you to know it , monsieur broussel , who knows everything ; but as for me , by holy truth , i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice ; you must not be angry with me for that , monsieur broussel . '' <EOS>	41.31186812859595
<SOS> `` on the contrary , my boy , on the contrary , i am pleased with your zeal . <EOS>	104.47663580070518
<SOS> dame nanette , look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son , with a crust of new bread . '' <EOS>	59.251024629562146
<SOS> `` oh , thank you , sir , thank you , monsieur broussel , '' said friquet ; `` i am so fond of apricots ! '' <EOS>	59.081146169807184
<SOS> broussel then proceeded to his wife 's room and asked for breakfast ; it was nine o'clock . <EOS>	56.478060197835696
<SOS> the councillor placed himself at the window ; the street was completely deserted , but in the distance was heard , like the noise of the tide rushing in , the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame . <EOS>	73.05606898784033
<SOS> this noise redoubled when d'artagnan , with a company of musketeers , placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church . <EOS>	94.29366112518517
<SOS> he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony ; and porthos , in full dress , mounted his finest horse , taking the part of supernumerary musketeer , as d'artagnan had so often done formerly . <EOS>	74.2621706502651
<SOS> the sergeant of this company , a veteran of the spanish wars , had recognized porthos , his old companion , and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville . <EOS>	72.10727047753393
<SOS> porthos had not only been well received by the company , but he was moreover looked on with great admiration . <EOS>	57.905791941221004
<SOS> at ten o'clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king , and then a movement , similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops , ran though the multitude , which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard . <EOS>	88.93785232138791
<SOS> at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot . <EOS>	49.93015754347577
<SOS> ten other carriages followed , containing the ladies of honor , the officers of the royal household , and the court . <EOS>	74.0518319454908
<SOS> `` god save the king ! '' <EOS>	100.04152129472602
<SOS> was the cry in every direction ; the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window , looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed ; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed . <EOS>	72.82779361465502
<SOS> just as the court was settling down in the cathedral , a carriage , bearing the arms of comminges , quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe , now entirely deserted . <EOS>	60.0317259284367
<SOS> when it arrived there , four guards and a police officer , who accompanied it , mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters ; then through an opening cautiously made , the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix , as if he was waiting for some one . <EOS>	74.887742047364
<SOS> all the world was occupied with the ceremony , so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed . <EOS>	65.54298081279663
<SOS> friquet , whose eye , ever on the alert , could alone have discovered them , had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of notre dame . <EOS>	78.42532416043034
<SOS> thence he saw the king , the queen and monsieur mazarin , and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty . <EOS>	103.33554212225087
<SOS> toward the end of the service , the queen , seeing comminges standing near her , waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre , said in a whisper : `` go , comminges , and may god aid you ! '' <EOS>	114.62494758528089
<SOS> comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe . <EOS>	112.18581350431255
<SOS> friquet , seeing this fine officer thus walk away , followed by two guards , amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage . <EOS>	90.20066563801556
<SOS> hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman , who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussel 's door . <EOS>	62.50840484215814
<SOS> comminges knocked at the door at the same moment , and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened . <EOS>	83.36029240286864
<SOS> `` what dost thou there , rascal ? '' <EOS>	63.86305966025654
<SOS> asked comminges . <EOS>	45.966559097921994
<SOS> `` i want to go into master broussel 's house , captain , '' replied friquet , in that wheedling way the `` gamins '' of paris know so well how to assume when necessary . <EOS>	44.29102148520074
<SOS> `` and on what floor does he live ? '' <EOS>	69.8910151064614
<SOS> asked comminges . <EOS>	111.25853603882788
<SOS> `` in the whole house , '' said friquet ; `` the house belongs to him ; he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals ; he must be at dinner now ; it is noon . '' <EOS>	77.09625531764668
<SOS> `` good , '' said comminges . <EOS>	78.55311662177188
<SOS> at this moment the door was opened , and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner . <EOS>	79.59097484825386
<SOS> broussel was seated at the table with his family , having his wife opposite to him , his two daughters by his side , and his son , louvieres , whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table . <EOS>	65.67539133193186
<SOS> the worthy man , restored to perfect health , was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him . <EOS>	77.26227451856911
<SOS> at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved , but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also . <EOS>	92.98062357108728
<SOS> still , in spite of this reciprocal politeness , the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness ; louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself . <EOS>	62.17338564496184
<SOS> `` sir , '' said comminges , `` i am the bearer of an order from the king . '' <EOS>	70.52215719643006
<SOS> `` very well , sir , '' replied broussel , `` what is this order ? '' <EOS>	90.40884419602149
<SOS> and he held out his hand . <EOS>	59.19489364998418
<SOS> `` i am commissioned to seize your person , sir , '' said comminges , in the same tone and with the same politeness ; `` and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me . '' <EOS>	63.1254472399182
<SOS> a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people , so peacefully assembled there , would not have produced a more appalling effect . <EOS>	96.16177955958065
<SOS> it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king . <EOS>	52.45204758863547
<SOS> louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword , which stood against a chair in a corner of the room ; but a glance from the worthy broussel , who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind , checked this foolhardy action of despair . <EOS>	59.022167905843524
<SOS> madame broussel , separated by the width of the table from her husband , burst into tears , and the young girls clung to their father 's arms . <EOS>	73.10876408872271
<SOS> `` come , sir , '' said comminges , `` make haste ; you must obey the king . '' <EOS>	83.35111661224047
<SOS> `` sir , '' said broussel , `` i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state ; i must have time . '' <EOS>	107.40405470028762
<SOS> `` it is impossible , '' said comminges ; `` the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant . '' <EOS>	81.35484180067179
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	84.63767224101677
<SOS> said louvieres ; `` sir , beware of driving us to despair . '' <EOS>	68.27403866034723
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	52.46648828314397
<SOS> cried a shrill voice from the end of the room . <EOS>	90.26947529325237
<SOS> comminges turned and saw dame nanette , her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand . <EOS>	56.31863247675182
<SOS> `` my good nanette , be quiet , i beseech you , '' said broussel . <EOS>	79.42036648252622
<SOS> `` me ! <EOS>	95.92718499214958
<SOS> keep quiet while my master is being arrested ! <EOS>	83.50350099335138
<SOS> he , the support , the liberator , the father of the people ! <EOS>	66.31371468142288
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	91.71961631057785
<SOS> well , yes ; you have to know me yet . <EOS>	47.16641234553839
<SOS> are you going ? '' <EOS>	77.16850574727628
<SOS> added she to comminges . <EOS>	92.24766865840763
<SOS> the latter smiled . <EOS>	77.53381301992661
<SOS> `` come , sir , '' said he , addressing broussel , `` silence that woman and follow me . '' <EOS>	92.71221929006248
<SOS> `` silence me ! <EOS>	57.71798316840778
<SOS> me ! <EOS>	49.37556375841402
<SOS> me ! '' <EOS>	52.98867788085297
<SOS> said nanette . <EOS>	66.1528375472142
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	92.6771761558068
<SOS> yet one wants some one besides you for that , my fine king 's cockatoo ! <EOS>	90.14588187993985
<SOS> you shall see . '' <EOS>	99.48326202378138
<SOS> and dame nanette sprang to the window , threw it open , and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame : `` help ! '' <EOS>	60.99727845350291
<SOS> she screamed , `` my master is being arrested ; the councillor broussel is being arrested ! <EOS>	79.77637275552377
<SOS> help ! '' <EOS>	107.15563636468792
<SOS> `` sir , '' said comminges , `` declare yourself at once ; will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king ? '' <EOS>	88.79454732303316
<SOS> `` i obey , i obey , sir ! '' <EOS>	49.43229951722208
<SOS> cried broussel , trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son , who seemed determined to dispute authority . <EOS>	53.57776376453295
<SOS> `` in that case , '' commanded comminges , `` silence that old woman . '' <EOS>	96.83549539357892
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	75.19660956425318
<SOS> old woman ! '' <EOS>	64.4622361946023
<SOS> screamed nanette . <EOS>	64.80037275946117
<SOS> and she began to shriek more loudly , clinging to the bars of the window : `` help ! <EOS>	54.09183677206783
<SOS> help ! <EOS>	74.60208044243747
<SOS> for master broussel , who is arrested because he has defended the people ! <EOS>	77.1968202333656
<SOS> help ! '' <EOS>	107.71315424334375
<SOS> comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post ; but at that instant a treble voice , proceeding from a kind of entresol , was heard screeching : `` murder ! <EOS>	76.02581531268211
<SOS> fire ! <EOS>	95.34358569398958
<SOS> assassins ! <EOS>	52.83676500848022
<SOS> master broussel is being killed ! <EOS>	55.56323169312773
<SOS> master broussel is being strangled . '' <EOS>	71.34414359708425
<SOS> it was friquet 's voice ; and dame nanette , feeling herself supported , recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk . <EOS>	65.42334122052331
<SOS> many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run , first men , then groups , and then a crowd of people ; hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it ; but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage . <EOS>	60.83881899188641
<SOS> `` they want to arrest master broussel ! '' <EOS>	109.82728264639668
<SOS> he cried ; `` the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs ! '' <EOS>	62.212124587791614
<SOS> the crowd began to murmur and approached the house . <EOS>	77.10563086890056
<SOS> the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges ; those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms . <EOS>	61.37734778842941
<SOS> `` do n't you see them ? '' <EOS>	112.89387497895622
<SOS> cried friquet , `` do n't you see ? <EOS>	72.32751993673998
<SOS> there they are ! '' <EOS>	76.32466962737259
<SOS> the coachman turning around , gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain . <EOS>	91.64021093844123
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	60.64858106227218
<SOS> devil 's coachman ! '' <EOS>	41.89752613118626
<SOS> cried friquet , `` you 're meddling too ! <EOS>	69.79208263639062
<SOS> wait ! '' <EOS>	43.84959107166208
<SOS> and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on . <EOS>	48.75311833269811
<SOS> the tumult now began to increase ; the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction ; the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage . <EOS>	87.20200796973135
<SOS> the soldiers , pushed back by these living walls , were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages . <EOS>	77.2049652414241
<SOS> the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times : `` in the king 's name , '' were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed , on the contrary , to exasperate it still more ; when , at the shout , `` in the name of the king , '' an officer ran up , and seeing the uniforms ill treated , he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand , and brought unexpected help to the guards . <EOS>	56.874444691189844
<SOS> this gentleman was a young man , scarcely sixteen years of age , now white with anger . <EOS>	47.75659733764306
<SOS> he leaped from his charger , placed his back against the shaft of the carriage , making a rampart of his horse , drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt , and began to fight with the back sword , like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon . <EOS>	94.14351599300002
<SOS> during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay ; at last comminges appeared , pushing broussel before him . <EOS>	78.70662840314712
<SOS> `` let us break the carriage ! '' <EOS>	68.95868650843464
<SOS> cried the people . <EOS>	94.67054921815446
<SOS> `` in the king 's name ! '' <EOS>	75.93266010096465
<SOS> cried comminges . <EOS>	66.64427523009907
<SOS> `` the first who advances is a dead man ! '' <EOS>	55.58990238780947
<SOS> cried raoul , for it was in fact he , who , feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen , pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back . <EOS>	49.15738740663372
<SOS> comminges , so to speak , threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him . <EOS>	65.24548894860875
<SOS> at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards . <EOS>	112.18144453942806
<SOS> comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor . <EOS>	59.948343770283984
<SOS> `` very well , sir , '' said comminges , `` you shall hear of this anon . '' <EOS>	65.02360176332921
<SOS> `` and you of me , sir , '' said louvieres ; `` and we shall see then who can speak the loudest . '' <EOS>	102.93226436569003
<SOS> friquet and nanette continued to shout ; the cries , the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects . <EOS>	94.41732248483927
<SOS> `` down with the officer ! <EOS>	71.56366832067268
<SOS> down with him ! '' <EOS>	74.32822537147156
<SOS> was the cry . <EOS>	68.1305608709418
<SOS> `` one step nearer , '' said comminges , putting down the sashes , that the interior of the carriage might be well seen , and placing his sword on his prisoner 's breast , `` one step nearer , and i kill the prisoner ; my orders were to carry him off alive or dead . <EOS>	72.45980497201188
<SOS> i will take him dead , that 's all . '' <EOS>	75.83766809486102
<SOS> a terrible cry was heard , and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people ; the latter knew that this officer , who was so pale , but who appeared so determined , would keep his word ; they continued to threaten , but they began to disperse . <EOS>	99.39339428923526
<SOS> `` drive to the palace , '' said comminges to the coachman , who was by then more dead than alive . <EOS>	43.85094433143061
<SOS> the man whipped his animals , which cleared a way through the crowd ; but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop ; the carriage was upset , the horses carried off , stifled , mangled by the crowd . <EOS>	43.300453469763404
<SOS> raoul , on foot , for he had not time to mount his horse again , tired , like the guards , of distributing blows with the flat of his sword , had recourse to its point . <EOS>	61.76945655861958
<SOS> but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude . <EOS>	68.49601736823844
<SOS> from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd ; projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard , the echo of which , though they were probably fired in the air , made all hearts vibrate . <EOS>	98.7393292500895
<SOS> voices , unheard except on days of revolution , were distinguished ; faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed . <EOS>	63.288129837407226
<SOS> cries of `` death ! <EOS>	82.29935030132607
<SOS> death to the guards ! <EOS>	86.88858390421701
<SOS> to the seine with the officer ! '' <EOS>	78.69540801376618
<SOS> were heard above all the noise , deafening as it was . <EOS>	63.35915163041823
<SOS> raoul , his hat in ribbons , his face bleeding , felt not only his strength but also his reason going ; a red mist covered his sight , and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him , ready to seize upon him when he fell . <EOS>	62.49851053232203
<SOS> the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation . <EOS>	80.77129163133989
<SOS> all was over ; carriages , horses , guards , and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds , when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard , and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air ; at the same time the crowd opened , upset , trodden down , and an officer of the musketeers , striking and cutting right and left , rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall . <EOS>	65.42384489093689
<SOS> `` god 's blood ! '' <EOS>	98.96793065460498
<SOS> cried the officer , `` have they killed him ? <EOS>	58.93744879192589
<SOS> woe to them if it be so ! '' <EOS>	86.15970608358073
<SOS> and he turned around , so stern with anger , strength and threat , that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another , in order to escape , and some of them even rolled into the seine . <EOS>	49.994781693196764
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	56.10544099584854
<SOS> murmured raoul . <EOS>	91.12941171615078
<SOS> `` yes , 'sdeath ! <EOS>	84.91807606114257
<SOS> in person , and fortunately it seems for you , my young friend . <EOS>	93.82168168255268
<SOS> come on , here , you others , '' he continued , rising in his stirrups , raising his sword , and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught . <EOS>	77.33314626682213
<SOS> `` come , sweep away all that for me ! <EOS>	64.15970212993028
<SOS> shoulder muskets ! <EOS>	88.26810867178934
<SOS> present arms ! <EOS>	60.89882123192574
<SOS> aim `` at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d'artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter . <EOS>	75.39657198661473
<SOS> `` thank you , d'artagnan , '' said comminges , showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle , `` thanks , my young friend ; your name that i may mention it to the queen . '' <EOS>	63.135602466299076
<SOS> raoul was about to reply when d'artagnan bent down to his ear . <EOS>	75.97429042595444
<SOS> `` hold your tongue , '' said he , `` and let me answer . <EOS>	97.11078162075331
<SOS> do not lose time , comminges , '' he continued ; `` get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up ; be quick , or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed . <EOS>	77.10392447259903
<SOS> hold ! <EOS>	113.38990312424554
<SOS> there 's a carriage coming over yonder . '' <EOS>	54.195922397943086
<SOS> then bending again to raoul , he whispered : `` above all things do not divulge your name . '' <EOS>	59.43746323320352
<SOS> `` that 's right . <EOS>	105.82139374656468
<SOS> i will go , '' said comminges ; `` and if they come back , fire ! '' <EOS>	105.661274967713
<SOS> `` not at all not at all , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` let no one move . <EOS>	55.608090421807624
<SOS> on the contrary , one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow . '' <EOS>	84.46581228815546
<SOS> comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage , from which he made the people inside dismount , and brought them to the vehicle which had upset . <EOS>	52.526167190603836
<SOS> but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other , the people , catching sight of him whom they called their liberator , uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle . <EOS>	72.84835494593689
<SOS> `` start , start ! '' <EOS>	99.17195398275973
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.96081435998647
<SOS> `` there are ten men to accompany you . <EOS>	53.413602043622845
<SOS> i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob ; go , and lose not a moment . <EOS>	81.72524494019868
<SOS> ten men for monsieur de comminges . '' <EOS>	46.28582601782028
<SOS> as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets . <EOS>	101.41080639347832
<SOS> a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded . <EOS>	54.5871737112488
<SOS> `` forward ! '' <EOS>	81.28984005163956
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , driven to extremities , biting his moustache ; and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear . <EOS>	64.38532091759558
<SOS> one man alone remained in his place , gun in hand . <EOS>	80.81470844896752
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	70.12087405864055
<SOS> he exclaimed , `` it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated ? <EOS>	77.09570063569858
<SOS> wait an instant . '' <EOS>	88.03606701412151
<SOS> and he pointed his gun at d'artagnan , who was riding toward him at full speed . <EOS>	71.2436155170218
<SOS> d'artagnan bent down to his horse 's neck , the young man fired , and the ball severed the feathers from the hat . <EOS>	73.79898053078612
<SOS> the horse started , brushed against the imprudent man , who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest , and he fell against the wall . <EOS>	75.39462887000586
<SOS> d'artagnan pulled up his horse , and whilst his musketeers continued to charge , he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down . <EOS>	56.897628034698855
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	84.54734937231034
<SOS> exclaimed raoul , recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix , `` spare him ! <EOS>	71.3193648638651
<SOS> it is his son ! '' <EOS>	101.15331440921436
<SOS> d'artagnan 's arm dropped to his side . <EOS>	49.29499239907693
<SOS> `` ah , you are his son ! '' <EOS>	106.5120899286322
<SOS> he said ; `` that is a different thing . '' <EOS>	54.41612847176216
<SOS> `` sir , i surrender , '' said louvieres , presenting his unloaded musket to the officer . <EOS>	52.02602753418666
<SOS> `` eh , no ! <EOS>	68.29346892915152
<SOS> do not surrender , egad ! <EOS>	48.848424618737276
<SOS> on the contrary , be off , and quickly . <EOS>	61.732678863571834
<SOS> if i take you , you will be hung ! '' <EOS>	56.202157426396475
<SOS> the young man did not wait to be told twice , but passing under the horse 's head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud . <EOS>	81.32382224480888
<SOS> `` i'faith ! '' <EOS>	64.01681393642124
<SOS> said d'artagnan to raoul , `` you were just in time to stay my hand . <EOS>	51.27791251391509
<SOS> he was a dead man ; and on my honor , if i had discovered that it was his son , i should have regretted having killed him . '' <EOS>	67.17772906546497
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	82.27567916283503
<SOS> sir ! '' <EOS>	46.55553300647446
<SOS> said raoul , `` allow me , after thanking you for that poor fellow 's life , to thank you on my own account . <EOS>	69.60945831015462
<SOS> i too , sir , was almost dead when you arrived . '' <EOS>	62.40402805428781
<SOS> `` wait , wait , young man ; do not fatigue yourself with speaking . <EOS>	73.90752894938329
<SOS> we can talk of it afterward . '' <EOS>	72.46798648325142
<SOS> then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael , he raised his sword for them to double their speed . <EOS>	57.32464716804159
<SOS> the musketeers trotted up , and at the same time the ten men whom d'artagnan had given to comminges appeared . <EOS>	62.78040943219256
<SOS> `` halloo ! '' <EOS>	85.14541058420947
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` has something fresh happened ? '' <EOS>	95.92596663211775
<SOS> `` eh , sir ! '' <EOS>	76.59131577317515
<SOS> replied the sergeant , `` their vehicle has broken down a second time ; it really must be doomed . '' <EOS>	69.69864458394427
<SOS> `` they are bad managers , '' said d'artagnan , shrugging his shoulders . <EOS>	92.96593441682148
<SOS> `` when a carriage is chosen , it ought to be strong . <EOS>	97.99069394450798
<SOS> the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men . '' <EOS>	61.787238085622754
<SOS> `` what are your commands , lieutenant ? '' <EOS>	52.59512554983987
<SOS> `` take the detachment and conduct him to his place . '' <EOS>	43.803335517740734
<SOS> `` but you will be left alone ? '' <EOS>	76.89349688804732
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	59.31202837134867
<SOS> so you suppose i have need of an escort ? <EOS>	95.08187041627338
<SOS> go . '' <EOS>	76.26967982894911
<SOS> the musketeers set off and d'artagnan was left alone with raoul . <EOS>	51.55614879809695
<SOS> `` now , '' he said , `` are you in pain ? '' <EOS>	87.29702416745202
<SOS> `` yes ; my head is not only swimming but burning . '' <EOS>	90.41046857661689
<SOS> `` what 's the matter with this head ? '' <EOS>	72.30308338536855
<SOS> said d'artagnan , raising the battered hat . <EOS>	112.65741749784978
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	85.59404068706951
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	91.71073483634687
<SOS> a bruise . '' <EOS>	56.53060460500777
<SOS> `` yes , i think i received a flower pot upon my head . '' <EOS>	66.0093300392929
<SOS> `` brutes ! '' <EOS>	96.99046092561936
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	87.73481178283005
<SOS> `` but were you not on horseback ? <EOS>	99.89224436245036
<SOS> you have spurs . '' <EOS>	71.24092858068654
<SOS> `` yes , but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away . <EOS>	75.72498885818817
<SOS> here it is , i see . '' <EOS>	51.239851951100015
<SOS> at this very moment friquet passed , mounted on raoul 's horse , waving his parti colored cap and crying , `` broussel ! <EOS>	74.1702496002453
<SOS> broussel ! '' <EOS>	101.20440827974237
<SOS> `` halloo ! <EOS>	81.00918681109248
<SOS> stop , rascal ! '' <EOS>	76.59396706742707
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	88.19010864254831
<SOS> `` bring hither that horse . '' <EOS>	86.43662041388681
<SOS> friquet heard perfectly , but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road . <EOS>	59.834352969246375
<SOS> d'artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet , but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it . <EOS>	79.25023048477613
<SOS> friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear . <EOS>	79.0046069614808
<SOS> he saw d'artagnan 's movement , heard the sound of the click , and stopped at once . <EOS>	71.43297587305777
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	104.90878294420004
<SOS> it is you , your honor , '' he said , advancing toward d'artagnan ; `` and i am truly pleased to meet you . '' <EOS>	69.7867875782911
<SOS> d'artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre . <EOS>	56.627573560958226
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	64.72619481211969
<SOS> 't is thou , rascal ! '' <EOS>	82.06975133143776
<SOS> said he , `` come here : so thou hast changed thy trade ; thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy ; thou hast become a horse stealer ? '' <EOS>	114.24874702901188
<SOS> `` ah , your honor , how can you say so ? '' <EOS>	47.70635324914742
<SOS> exclaimed friquet . <EOS>	88.58586617974602
<SOS> `` i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer , brave and handsome as a youthful caesar ; '' then , pretending to see raoul for the first time : `` ah ! <EOS>	103.05045959145815
<SOS> but if i mistake not , '' continued he , `` here he is ; you wo n't forget the boy , sir . '' <EOS>	106.80632301712416
<SOS> raoul put his hand in his pocket . <EOS>	97.58741318370794
<SOS> `` what are you about ? '' <EOS>	82.75521039397799
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	61.52058475834945
<SOS> `` to give ten francs to this honest fellow , '' replied raoul , taking a pistole from his pocket . <EOS>	58.11953096904025
<SOS> `` ten kicks on his back ! '' <EOS>	56.90942053687679
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` be off , you little villain , and forget not that i have your address . '' <EOS>	76.56215538982929
<SOS> friquet , who did not expect to be let off so cheaply , bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine , and disappeared . <EOS>	54.724064999394415
<SOS> raoul mounted his horse , and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne . <EOS>	72.18153920017035
<SOS> d'artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son . <EOS>	74.35792204887493
<SOS> they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette . <EOS>	69.56320930180547
<SOS> the handsome madeleine announced to d'artagnan that planchet had returned , bringing mousqueton with him , who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit . <EOS>	53.245392062581274
<SOS> d'artagnan desired planchet to be summoned , but he had disappeared . <EOS>	72.1403522818425
<SOS> `` then bring some wine , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	76.9539366090026
<SOS> `` you are much pleased with yourself , '' said he to raoul when they were alone , `` are you not ? '' <EOS>	90.76217962374768
<SOS> `` well , yes , '' replied raoul . <EOS>	95.38023107255273
<SOS> `` it seems to me i did my duty . <EOS>	85.93383831722224
<SOS> i defended the king . '' <EOS>	66.02765890355087
<SOS> `` and who told you to defend the king ? '' <EOS>	86.78311054901224
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere himself . '' <EOS>	50.91598176499224
<SOS> `` yes , the king ; but to day you have not fought for the king , you have fought for mazarin ; which is not quite the same thing . '' <EOS>	70.09454003139975
<SOS> `` but you yourself ? '' <EOS>	66.29333415312784
<SOS> `` oh , for me ; that is another matter . <EOS>	57.87848899910721
<SOS> i obey my captain 's orders . <EOS>	78.2305185081233
<SOS> as for you , your captain is the prince , understand that rightly ; you have no other . <EOS>	73.1586837800741
<SOS> but has one ever seen such a wild fellow , '' continued he , `` making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel ! <EOS>	53.90905877060966
<SOS> breathe not a word of that , or the comte de la fere will be furious . '' <EOS>	94.13098237055281
<SOS> `` you think the count will be angry with me ? '' <EOS>	79.6630363555782
<SOS> `` think it ? <EOS>	106.24707561490116
<SOS> i 'm certain of it ; were it not for that , i should thank you , for you have worked for us . <EOS>	43.20930785837627
<SOS> however , i scold you instead of him , and in his place ; the storm will blow over more easily , believe me . <EOS>	106.78400929701799
<SOS> and moreover , my dear child , '' continued d'artagnan , `` i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian . '' <EOS>	94.15034461094494
<SOS> `` i do not understand you , sir , '' said raoul . <EOS>	74.58461996064003
<SOS> d'artagnan rose , and taking a letter from his writing desk , presented it to raoul . <EOS>	54.09340094621183
<SOS> the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper . <EOS>	74.38114988406147
<SOS> `` oh , mon dieu ! '' <EOS>	59.23139983868298
<SOS> he said , raising his fine eyes to d'artagnan , moist with tears , `` the count has left paris without seeing me ? '' <EOS>	83.4326013223399
<SOS> `` he left four days ago , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.23828827918648
<SOS> `` but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger , perhaps death . '' <EOS>	79.70397024250151
<SOS> `` he he incur danger of death ! <EOS>	47.824398369072256
<SOS> no , be not anxious ; he is traveling on business and will return ere long . <EOS>	53.54055327324938
<SOS> i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim . '' <EOS>	46.51303701712444
<SOS> `` oh , no , monsieur d'artagnan , '' said raoul , `` you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you ! '' <EOS>	66.55468740848751
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	55.23366131216084

<SOS> and the coadjutor and madame de longueville ; and if the worthy broussel were there , whom you so stupidly helped arrest , i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks . '' <EOS>	106.02724276473128

<SOS> `` yes , but in exchange , '' said porthos , covered with perspiration and soiled by dust , `` in exchange , i have torn many skins . <EOS>	84.14216437166338
<SOS> those wretches wanted to take away my sword ! <EOS>	65.62792860462697
<SOS> deuce take 'em , what a popular commotion ! '' <EOS>	58.1429154499897
<SOS> continued the giant , in his quiet manner ; `` but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde . <EOS>	56.934106192120545
<SOS> a draught of wine , d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	79.44382462162999
<SOS> `` oh , i 'll answer for you , '' said the gascon , filling porthos 's glass to the brim ; `` but when you have drunk , give me your opinion . '' <EOS>	43.085284588660194
<SOS> `` upon what ? '' <EOS>	53.360154348485814
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	75.3956839136511
<SOS> `` look here , '' resumed d'artagnan ; `` here is monsieur de bragelonne , who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges . '' <EOS>	96.17698865933424
<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	89.66751328990553
<SOS> said porthos ; `` and his guardian , what would he have said to that ? '' <EOS>	71.03121503641967
<SOS> `` do you hear ? '' <EOS>	97.27959622784753
<SOS> interrupted d'artagnan ; `` become a frondist , my friend , belong to the fronde , and remember that i fill the count 's place in everything ; '' and he jingled his money . <EOS>	91.4094022711881
<SOS> `` will you come ? '' <EOS>	54.41572620854558
<SOS> said he to porthos . <EOS>	76.64634154804892
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	75.04609744555464
<SOS> asked porthos , filling a second glass of wine . <EOS>	84.40475721985958
<SOS> `` to present our respects to the cardinal . '' <EOS>	61.81062290656156
<SOS> porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first , took his beaver and followed d'artagnan . <EOS>	100.59144714903054
<SOS> as for raoul , he remained bewildered with what he had seen , having been forbidden by d'artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over . <EOS>	91.80151632188085
<SOS> chapter xlv . <EOS>	58.6619045986045
<SOS> the beggar of st. eustache . <EOS>	73.31066574399736
<SOS> d'artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him , and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he , d'artagnan , and his friend had rendered to the queen 's party in the morning . <EOS>	61.489609269357814
<SOS> they were indeed admirably received by mazarin , who paid them numerous compliments , and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired , namely , d'artagnan his captaincy , porthos his barony . <EOS>	102.29474521575688
<SOS> d'artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk , for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform . <EOS>	91.13970938852779
<SOS> but , though he held the cardinal 's promises as of little worth , he affected to be completely satisfied , for he was unwilling to discourage porthos . <EOS>	80.69878088447132
<SOS> whilst the two friends were with the cardinal , the queen sent for him . <EOS>	77.25196876591748
<SOS> mazarin , thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen , motioned them to follow him . <EOS>	59.06644810344556
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses , but the cardinal shook his head . <EOS>	94.51577406162123
<SOS> `` those costumes , '' he said , `` are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen 's courtiers ; they are costumes of battle . '' <EOS>	71.12502305886353
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos obeyed . <EOS>	56.6342044678537
<SOS> the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation ; for , after having gained a victory over the spaniard , it had just gained another over the people . <EOS>	100.0329586649253
<SOS> broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance , and was at this time in the prison of saint germain ; while blancmesnil , who was arrested at the same time , but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise , was safe in the castle of vincennes . <EOS>	63.15941679361814
<SOS> comminges was near the queen , who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition , and every one was listening to his account , when d'artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door , behind the cardinal . <EOS>	90.63434272464389
<SOS> `` ah , madame , '' said comminges , hastening to d'artagnan , `` here is one who can tell you better than myself , for he was my protector . <EOS>	111.32857970709463
<SOS> without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud , for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river . <EOS>	68.03796985160014
<SOS> speak , d'artagnan , speak . '' <EOS>	85.59086117978902
<SOS> d'artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers , but her majesty had never once spoken to him . <EOS>	66.1765172993495
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' at last said anne of austria , `` you are silent , after rendering such a service ? '' <EOS>	95.35140803838686
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied d'artagnan , `` i have nought to say , save that my life is ever at your majesty 's service , and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you . '' <EOS>	64.45542842141721
<SOS> `` i know that , sir ; i have known that , '' said the queen , `` a long time ; therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem . '' <EOS>	83.99482213893408
<SOS> `` permit me , madame , '' said d'artagnan , `` to reserve a portion for my friend ; like myself '' ( he laid an emphasis on these words ) `` an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville ; he has done wonders . '' <EOS>	78.42555337257323
<SOS> `` his name ? '' <EOS>	62.54953374949694
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	78.55367437617238
<SOS> `` in the regiment , '' said d'artagnan , `` he is called porthos '' ( the queen started ) , `` but his true name is the chevalier du vallon . '' <EOS>	47.61436923930022
<SOS> `` de bracieux de pierrefonds , '' added porthos . <EOS>	76.17830481718622
<SOS> `` these names are too numerous for me to remember them all , and i will content myself with the first , '' said the queen , graciously . <EOS>	67.46727351165342
<SOS> porthos bowed . <EOS>	71.275452728135
<SOS> at this moment the coadjutor was announced ; a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage . <EOS>	74.38881470134622
<SOS> although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde ; and mazarin , in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach , had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving . <EOS>	50.06621389602879
<SOS> the fact was , in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day . <EOS>	102.07874984447588
<SOS> although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping stone . <EOS>	103.70629371890239
<SOS> monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle 's place , and cardinal , like mazarin ; and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal . <EOS>	93.17218117900256
<SOS> he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens , determined beforehand to act with or against the court , as his congratulations were well or ill received . <EOS>	113.79028409322636
<SOS> the coadjutor possessed , perhaps , as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him . <EOS>	86.19513940027221
<SOS> his speech , therefore , was so well turned , that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh , they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule . <EOS>	53.81666206758715
<SOS> he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty 's command . <EOS>	77.07060914307517
<SOS> during the whole time he was speaking , the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor 's harangue ; but terminating as it did with such a phrase , the only one which could be caught at by the jokers , anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites , which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies . <EOS>	119.13438619967579
<SOS> immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire . <EOS>	49.80250466027043
<SOS> nogent beautin , the fool of the court , exclaimed that `` the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment . '' <EOS>	50.953007392278344
<SOS> this caused a universal burst of laughter . <EOS>	66.91766871640255
<SOS> the count de villeroy said that `` he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment , when the court had , to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of paris , his holiness the coadjutor , who by a signal could raise an army of curates , church porters and vergers . '' <EOS>	93.33886628721092
<SOS> the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat , as henry iv . <EOS>	81.72278651240134
<SOS> had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of ivry . <EOS>	66.86604835278328
<SOS> during this storm , gondy , who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters , remained calm and stern . <EOS>	68.9511881866646
<SOS> the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her . <EOS>	96.18380206345309
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' replied the coadjutor ; `` i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom . '' <EOS>	86.80263816685402
<SOS> the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced . <EOS>	100.00338517890295
<SOS> the coadjutor bowed and left the palace , casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes . <EOS>	94.20987494784711
<SOS> that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin , who , reading in it a declaration of war , seized d'artagnan by the arm and said : `` if occasion requires , monsieur , you will remember that man who has just gone out , will you not ? '' <EOS>	45.324908117025394
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , '' he replied . <EOS>	73.23936704715983
<SOS> then , turning toward porthos , `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	85.26297962392398
<SOS> said he , `` this has a bad look . <EOS>	64.71297084745991
<SOS> i dislike these quarrels among men of the church . '' <EOS>	69.36958684115076
<SOS> gondy withdrew , distributing benedictions on his way , and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet . <EOS>	49.10083932328149
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	99.67001790463318
<SOS> he murmured , as he left the threshold of the palace : `` ungrateful court ! <EOS>	48.694196677476526
<SOS> faithless court ! <EOS>	76.59430962402261
<SOS> cowardly court ! <EOS>	91.80455111456112
<SOS> i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner . '' <EOS>	58.13062855395776
<SOS> but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal , to increase the hilarity of the queen , mazarin , a man of sense , and whose fear , moreover , gave him foresight , lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes ; he went out after the coadjutor , settled his account , locked up his gold , and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls . <EOS>	61.792795139554265
<SOS> on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him ; he started with delight when , on demanding the name of this young man , he learned that it was louvieres . <EOS>	64.23062158619638
<SOS> he hastened to his cabinet . <EOS>	61.05956485783138
<SOS> broussel 's son was there , still furious , and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king 's officers . <EOS>	69.46913914439958
<SOS> the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend . <EOS>	68.51229851895422
<SOS> the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand . <EOS>	65.94139577750047
<SOS> the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart . <EOS>	91.08582558425495
<SOS> `` my dear monsieur louvieres , '' said the coadjutor , `` believe me , i am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you . '' <EOS>	82.98310453456693
<SOS> `` is that true , and do you speak seriously ? '' <EOS>	72.67613406748984
<SOS> asked louvieres . <EOS>	95.72595612050915
<SOS> `` from the depth of my heart , '' said gondy . <EOS>	81.46723457706425
<SOS> `` in that case , my lord , the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand ; my lord , in three days , if you wish it , my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal . '' <EOS>	85.20649986096504
<SOS> the coadjutor started . <EOS>	77.25950077574845
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	90.47531670281012
<SOS> let us speak frankly , '' continued louvieres , `` and act in a straightforward manner . <EOS>	115.86113969332499
<SOS> thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given , as you have done for the last six months , out of pure christian charity ; that would be too grand . <EOS>	77.46871545114321
<SOS> you are ambitious it is natural ; you are a man of genius and you know your worth . <EOS>	90.52086348029367
<SOS> as for me , i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance . <EOS>	80.30700915912409
<SOS> give us the clergy and the people , of whom you can dispose , and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament ; with these four elements paris is ours in a week ; and believe me , monsieur coadjutor , the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will . '' <EOS>	72.0956454722321
<SOS> it was now the coadjutor 's turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres . <EOS>	71.46358352595945
<SOS> `` but , monsieur louvieres , are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me ? '' <EOS>	63.55146143171343
<SOS> `` you have been preparing long enough , my lord , for it to be welcome to you now . '' <EOS>	48.76849916178971
<SOS> `` never mind , '' said the coadjutor ; `` you must be well aware that this requires reflection . '' <EOS>	78.72244843506762
<SOS> `` and how many hours of reflection do you ask ? '' <EOS>	95.4221478958852
<SOS> `` twelve hours , sir ; is it too long ? '' <EOS>	94.24434508566685
<SOS> `` it is now noon ; at midnight i will be at your house . '' <EOS>	59.118301868419465
<SOS> `` if i should not be in , wait for me . '' <EOS>	81.7643096382136
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	57.15703480009641
<SOS> at midnight , my lord . '' <EOS>	106.85301167449111
<SOS> `` at midnight , my dear monsieur louvieres . '' <EOS>	70.1344270924151
<SOS> when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house . <EOS>	82.14244095549562
<SOS> two hours later , thirty officiating ministers from the most populous , and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there . <EOS>	58.35691966878764
<SOS> gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin , the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie . <EOS>	53.16794724907994
<SOS> the curates asked him what was to be done . <EOS>	78.20587130434481
<SOS> `` simply this , '' said the coadjutor . <EOS>	91.88280117227742
<SOS> `` you are the directors of all consciences . <EOS>	77.00937322829448
<SOS> well , undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings ; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant ; and repeat often and loudly , so that all may know it , that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin , her lover and her destroyer ; begin this work to day , this instant even , and in three days i shall expect the result . <EOS>	65.73846615819593
<SOS> for the rest , if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound , i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure . '' <EOS>	75.32578649531371
<SOS> three curates remained those of st. merri , st. sulpice and st. eustache . <EOS>	63.24295017904614
<SOS> the others withdrew . <EOS>	71.61641180568407
<SOS> `` you think , then , that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers ? '' <EOS>	60.58916312496959
<SOS> said gondy . <EOS>	90.53936763730877
<SOS> `` we hope so , '' answered the curates . <EOS>	88.61566258143843
<SOS> `` let us hear . <EOS>	106.52681055588506
<SOS> monsieur de st. merri , you begin . '' <EOS>	82.57898426179041
<SOS> `` my lord , i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you . '' <EOS>	61.626684355769555
<SOS> `` who and what is this man ? '' <EOS>	93.63142453612996
<SOS> `` a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards , who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter . '' <EOS>	62.60576249961585
<SOS> `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	67.48594770170573
<SOS> `` he is named planchet , who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago ; but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared . '' <EOS>	61.074655509750684
<SOS> `` and can you find him ? '' <EOS>	86.07488209332
<SOS> `` i hope so . <EOS>	55.002597190685485
<SOS> i think he has not been arrested , and as i am his wife 's confessor , if she knows where he is i shall know it too . '' <EOS>	68.02051734428177
<SOS> `` very well , sir , find this man , and when you have found him bring him to me . '' <EOS>	106.65381860626944
<SOS> `` we will be with you at six o'clock , my lord . '' <EOS>	86.14602810275073
<SOS> `` go , my dear curate , and may god assist you ! '' <EOS>	90.9084007353282
<SOS> `` and you , sir ? '' <EOS>	68.52989523616138
<SOS> continued gondy , turning to the curate of st. sulpice . <EOS>	66.10134326158419
<SOS> `` i , my lord , '' said the latter , `` i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt . <EOS>	101.89788421736478
<SOS> him i can place at your disposal ; it is count de rochefort . '' <EOS>	63.7968371009338
<SOS> `` i know him also , but unfortunately he is not in paris . '' <EOS>	73.92647406620748
<SOS> `` my lord , he has been for three days at the rue cassette . '' <EOS>	77.94213680501339
<SOS> `` and wherefore has he not been to see me ? '' <EOS>	47.37766699032406
<SOS> `` he was told my lord will pardon me `` `` certainly , speak . '' <EOS>	67.75126708848778
<SOS> `` that your lordship was about to treat with the court . '' <EOS>	64.31052465601802
<SOS> gondy bit his lips . <EOS>	97.06930551060246
<SOS> `` they are mistaken ; bring him here at eight o'clock , sir , and may heaven bless you as i bless you ! '' <EOS>	76.37265687364832
<SOS> `` and now 't is your turn , '' said the coadjutor , turning to the last that remained ; `` have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us ? '' <EOS>	62.21778799513638
<SOS> `` better , my lord . '' <EOS>	60.753400556503486
<SOS> `` diable ! <EOS>	71.18483513470177

<SOS> `` i offer you a beggar , my lord . '' <EOS>	61.21106080699419
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	60.89243083746584
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	57.294160293252325
<SOS> said gondy , reflecting , `` you are right , sir ; some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris ; some one who would know how to cry aloud to them , that all france might hear it , that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty .

<SOS> `` yes , i have heard it said , '' replied the coadjutor . <EOS>	63.53134562966874
<SOS> `` well , the man whom i offer you is a general syndic . '' <EOS>	74.81746205398278
<SOS> `` and what do you know of him ? '' <EOS>	75.13871595926585
<SOS> `` nothing , my lord , except that he is tormented with remorse . '' <EOS>	46.59056031666987
<SOS> `` what makes you think so ? '' <EOS>	55.30729862245617
<SOS> `` on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death ; yesterday i said this mass again . '' <EOS>	42.040059888521405

<SOS> `` maillard ; but i do not think it is his right one . '' <EOS>	102.66664730220484
<SOS> `` and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post ? '' <EOS>	91.24722909110476
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	104.00096452807358
<SOS> `` let us go and see your beggar , sir , and if he is such as you describe him , you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure . '' <EOS>	74.92566945020556
<SOS> gondy dressed himself as an officer , put on a felt cap with a red feather , hung on a long sword , buckled spurs to his boots , wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate . <EOS>	74.70650271877898
<SOS> the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st. eustache church , watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling . <EOS>	68.71171575817755
<SOS> the people were in an excited mood , but , like a swarm of frightened bees , seemed not to know at what point to concentrate ; and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing . <EOS>	91.9805691889679
<SOS> on arriving at the rue des prouvaires , the curate pointed toward the square before the church . <EOS>	72.71924925041263
<SOS> `` stop ! '' <EOS>	62.96230120000673
<SOS> he said , `` there he is at his post . '' <EOS>	54.74972899298858
<SOS> gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings ; a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand . <EOS>	72.99236900957276
<SOS> `` is it by permission that he remains there ? '' <EOS>	100.47238520979039
<SOS> asked gondy . <EOS>	108.97604322945354
<SOS> `` no , my lord ; these places are bought . <EOS>	76.51093200214991
<SOS> i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his . '' <EOS>	84.44196727670267
<SOS> `` the rascal is rich , then ? '' <EOS>	81.42460607488262
<SOS> `` some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more . '' <EOS>	50.87925664617238
<SOS> `` hum ! '' <EOS>	94.99743550922268
<SOS> said gondy , laughing ; `` i was not aware my alms were so well invested . '' <EOS>	47.56060745867086
<SOS> in the meantime they were advancing toward the square , and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush . <EOS>	53.248547390848024
<SOS> he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age , little , rather stout , with gray hair and light eyes . <EOS>	84.18415505113352
<SOS> his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principles a wicked nature , subdued by determination , perhaps by repentance . <EOS>	70.58084930495944
<SOS> he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate . <EOS>	75.0662036494052
<SOS> the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross ; the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat , which was on the ground . <EOS>	97.61809934486799
<SOS> `` maillard , '' began the curate , `` this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little . '' <EOS>	80.92562503379584
<SOS> `` with me ! '' <EOS>	70.54009562111038
<SOS> said the mendicant ; `` it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water . '' <EOS>	52.50691193378626
<SOS> there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor . <EOS>	68.96452521924117
<SOS> `` yes , '' continued the curate , apparently accustomed to this tone , `` yes , we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church . '' <EOS>	67.96717642077277
<SOS> the mendicant shook his head . <EOS>	80.32169570217106
<SOS> `` these are melancholy doings , your reverence , which always fall again upon the poor . <EOS>	69.03887798683373
<SOS> as to what is said , everybody is discontented , everybody complains , but 'everybody ' means 'nobody . ' '' <EOS>	43.94926152876543
<SOS> `` explain yourself , my good friend , '' said the coadjutor . <EOS>	115.67751424754401
<SOS> `` i mean that all these cries , all these complaints , these curses , produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all ; but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it . '' <EOS>	91.60893135497547
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said gondy , `` you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man ; are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war , should we have one , and put at the command of the leader , should we find one , your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades ? '' <EOS>	114.27299604710994
<SOS> `` yes , sir , provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean , the remission of my sins . '' <EOS>	62.90865822743789
<SOS> `` the war will not only be approved of , but directed by the church . <EOS>	63.562972230323474
<SOS> as for the remission of your sins , we have the archbishop of paris , who has the very greatest power at the court of rome , and even the coadjutor , who possesses some plenary indulgences ; we will recommend you to him . '' <EOS>	65.30167154076057
<SOS> `` consider , maillard , '' said the curate , `` that i have recommended you to this gentleman , who is a powerful lord , and that i have made myself responsible for you . '' <EOS>	51.125505513772886
<SOS> `` i know , monsieur le curé , '' said the beggar , `` that you have always been very kind to me , and therefore i , in my turn , will be serviceable to you . '' <EOS>	81.30162298400228
<SOS> `` and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now ? '' <EOS>	89.56344346523058
<SOS> `` i think they have some esteem for me , '' said the mendicant with pride , `` and that not only will they obey me , but wherever i go they will follow me . '' <EOS>	55.60287752401375
<SOS> `` and could you count on fifty resolute men , good , unemployed , but active souls , brawlers , capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying , 'down with mazarin , ' as fell those at jericho ? '' <EOS>	54.99745259986118
<SOS> `` i think , '' said the beggar , `` i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that . '' <EOS>	77.36039313270689
<SOS> `` ah , ah , '' said gondy , `` you will undertake , then , some night , to throw up some ten barricades ? '' <EOS>	63.75040694066852
<SOS> `` i will undertake to throw up fifty , and when the day comes , to defend them . '' <EOS>	50.046348032433535
<SOS> `` i'faith ! '' <EOS>	95.43956199075646
<SOS> exclaimed gondy , `` you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure ; and since monsieur le curé can answer for you `` `` i answer for him , '' said the curate . <EOS>	67.70651672646201
<SOS> `` here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold ; make all your arrangements , and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten o'clock . '' <EOS>	65.26351377734557
<SOS> `` it must be on some elevated place , whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris . '' <EOS>	41.52992670277682
<SOS> `` shall i give you a line for the vicar of st. jacques de la boucherie ? <EOS>	43.62005588614391
<SOS> he will let you into the rooms in his tower , '' said the curate . <EOS>	120.45464101643023
<SOS> `` capital , '' answered the mendicant . <EOS>	42.39191815350948
<SOS> `` then , '' said the coadjutor , `` this evening , at ten o'clock , and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal . '' <EOS>	82.38350750790974
<SOS> the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity , but he quickly suppressed his emotion . <EOS>	64.63582966997159
<SOS> `` this evening , sir , '' he replied , `` all will be ready . '' <EOS>	98.95072289800714

<SOS> the tower of st. jacques de la boucherie . <EOS>	71.03317287227614
<SOS> at a quarter to six o'clock , monsieur de gondy , having finished his business , returned to the archiepiscopal palace . <EOS>	50.74555232722089
<SOS> at six o'clock the curate of st. merri was announced . <EOS>	69.60885434888152
<SOS> the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man . <EOS>	47.17615096867844
<SOS> the curate then entered , followed by planchet . <EOS>	76.7799474714428
<SOS> `` your holiness , '' said the curate , `` here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you . '' <EOS>	96.63092098883844
<SOS> planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses . <EOS>	80.26165435210119
<SOS> `` and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people ? '' <EOS>	107.8700607960661
<SOS> asked gondy . <EOS>	82.78937450281363
<SOS> `` most undoubtedly , '' said planchet . <EOS>	88.62789479982699
<SOS> `` i am a frondist from my heart . <EOS>	72.59719830011562

<SOS> `` and on what account ? '' <EOS>	51.93839015757864
<SOS> `` i rescued from the hands of mazarin 's police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile , where he had been for five years . '' <EOS>	87.00972794416008
<SOS> `` will you name him ? '' <EOS>	78.55866702925238

<SOS> you raised the whole district , so they told me ! '' <EOS>	77.04360042695785
<SOS> `` very nearly , '' replied planchet , with a self satisfied air . <EOS>	54.96340812666246
<SOS> `` and your business is `` `` that of a confectioner , in the rue des lombards . '' <EOS>	102.76472801662631
<SOS> `` explain to me how it happens that , following so peaceful a business , you had such warlike inclinations . '' <EOS>	82.82232962033856
<SOS> `` why does my lord , belonging to the church , now receive me in the dress of an officer , with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots ? '' <EOS>	85.69610082878073
<SOS> `` not badly answered , i'faith , '' said gondy , laughing ; `` but i have , you must know , always had , in spite of my bands , warlike inclinations . '' <EOS>	84.33377085057833
<SOS> `` well , my lord , before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment , and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	62.44691066485092
<SOS> `` the lieutenant of musketeers ? '' <EOS>	68.25805123059386

<SOS> whistled planchet . <EOS>	88.87759819809744
<SOS> `` what do you mean by that ? '' <EOS>	47.37022551915253
<SOS> `` nothing , my lord ; monsieur d'artagnan belongs to the service ; monsieur d'artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal , who pays him , as much as we make it ours , we citizens , to attack him , whom he robs . '' <EOS>	44.46255074082401
<SOS> `` you are an intelligent fellow , my friend ; can we count upon you ? '' <EOS>	71.83331457734936

<SOS> `` i would follow him to hell , and that is saying not a little , as i believe him entirely capable of the descent . '' <EOS>	110.8401207985966

<SOS> `` money never comes amiss at any time , my lord ; if one has it not , one must do without it ; with it , matters go on much better and more rapidly . '' <EOS>	70.91925574318697
<SOS> gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag . <EOS>	70.3293286610137
<SOS> `` here are five hundred pistoles , '' he said ; `` and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow . '' <EOS>	80.70699430062639
<SOS> `` i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship , '' said planchet , putting the bag under his arm . <EOS>	81.32642349745821

<SOS> `` make your mind easy , he is in good hands . '' <EOS>	51.7073393067628

<SOS> `` are you satisfied , my lord ? '' <EOS>	60.6632286630204
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	91.52033813274298

<SOS> the curate rejoined planchet , who was waiting for him on the stairs . <EOS>	122.53077932949024
<SOS> ten minutes later the curate of st. sulpice was announced . <EOS>	69.99386583995904
<SOS> as soon as the door of gondy 's study was opened a man rushed in . <EOS>	93.25849335451659
<SOS> it was the count de rochefort . <EOS>	60.067513037641405
<SOS> `` 't is you , then , my dear count , '' cried gondy , offering his hand . <EOS>	77.18132794878962
<SOS> `` you have made up your mind at last , my lord ? '' <EOS>	97.59723948833357

<SOS> `` you care about it , then , so much ? '' <EOS>	65.4134376200832
<SOS> `` since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me , '' said gondy , `` i wish at least that the hat should be red . '' <EOS>	77.24520907671709

<SOS> `` ah , monsieur mazarin , monsieur mazarin , '' said rochefort , leading off his curate , who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue , `` you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action . '' <EOS>	91.50243035891575
<SOS> it was half past nine o'clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop 's palace to the tower of st. jacques de la boucherie . <EOS>	81.46685116979461
<SOS> he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower . <EOS>	69.55157289683177
<SOS> `` good , '' said he , `` our syndic is at his post . '' <EOS>	74.41488864660859
<SOS> he knocked and the door was opened . <EOS>	70.90402860681448
<SOS> the vicar himself awaited him , conducted him to the top of the tower , and when there pointed to a little door , placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall , that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return , and went down again . <EOS>	65.90425587754518
<SOS> although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked . <EOS>	63.72667881840827
<SOS> `` come in , '' said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant , whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed . <EOS>	122.5309931807728
<SOS> he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor , and at that moment ten o'clock struck . <EOS>	73.37756871559323

<SOS> `` you asked me for five hundred men , did you not ? <EOS>	47.52395151671384
<SOS> well , i have ten thousand for you . '' <EOS>	73.86658855929623
<SOS> `` you are not boasting ? '' <EOS>	64.72813693774296
<SOS> `` do you wish for a proof ? '' <EOS>	57.33594054846384
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	93.42597691189111
<SOS> there were three candles alight , each of which burnt before a window , one looking upon the city , the other upon the palais royal , and a third upon the rue saint denis . <EOS>	87.9279786022242
<SOS> the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other . <EOS>	113.19965387597051
<SOS> `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	117.67819846041674
<SOS> asked the coadjutor . <EOS>	102.0371918730285
<SOS> `` i have given the signal . '' <EOS>	52.22637809937974
<SOS> `` for what ? '' <EOS>	68.78470369417431
<SOS> `` for the barricades . <EOS>	88.01291443771827
<SOS> when you leave this you will behold my men at work . <EOS>	76.75487331682392
<SOS> only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole . '' <EOS>	66.31947433616116
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	94.7453255008833
<SOS> there is your money , the same sum as that you have received already . <EOS>	55.62464063387109
<SOS> now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink . '' <EOS>	88.46283743098145
<SOS> `` for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water . '' <EOS>	101.544964308099
<SOS> the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor , who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces . <EOS>	63.31800347153158
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	51.31570356376405
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	98.00107327498438
<SOS> said the coadjutor , `` you are avaricious , my good fellow . '' <EOS>	60.58455825020909
<SOS> the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag . <EOS>	59.31065626991329
<SOS> `` must i always be the same ? '' <EOS>	52.44449198745366
<SOS> said he , `` and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven ? <EOS>	93.01806861456215
<SOS> oh , misery , oh , vanity ! '' <EOS>	104.44006973961012
<SOS> `` you take it , however . '' <EOS>	53.91146314911976
<SOS> `` yes , but i make hereby a vow in your presence , to employ all that remains to me in pious works . '' <EOS>	70.83732117109132
<SOS> his face was pale and drawn , like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle . <EOS>	67.22432887930937
<SOS> `` singular man ! '' <EOS>	68.75989630559741
<SOS> muttered gondy , taking his hat to go away ; but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door . <EOS>	78.66220320772624
<SOS> his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm , but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped . <EOS>	67.84624631912182
<SOS> `` your blessing , your holiness , before you go , i beseech you ! '' <EOS>	79.8860042931308
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	42.786530523797474
<SOS> `` your holiness ! '' <EOS>	67.64757534006455
<SOS> said gondy ; `` my friend , you take me for some one else . '' <EOS>	89.8721455658873
<SOS> `` no , your holiness , i take you for what you are , that is to say , the coadjutor ; i recognized you at the first glance . '' <EOS>	90.85138975409579
<SOS> gondy smiled . <EOS>	52.83139667766688
<SOS> `` and you want my blessing ? '' <EOS>	76.33220763456659
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	75.41800959007713
<SOS> `` yes , i have need of it . '' <EOS>	108.06008165449447
<SOS> the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility , such earnest repentance , that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable . <EOS>	74.42733555283662
<SOS> `` now , '' said gondy , `` there is a communion between us . <EOS>	90.92617156453379
<SOS> i have blessed you and you are sacred to me . <EOS>	102.07895007615906
<SOS> come , have you committed some crime , pursued by human justice , from which i can protect you ? '' <EOS>	82.86387544999138
<SOS> the beggar shook his head . <EOS>	81.92931322067064
<SOS> `` the crime which i have committed , my lord , has no call upon human justice , and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently , as you have just done . '' <EOS>	67.6203682546729
<SOS> `` come , be candid , '' said the coadjutor , `` you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now ? '' <EOS>	71.93172344526147
<SOS> `` no , my lord . <EOS>	100.11090645259796

<SOS> `` and before you went to the bastile ? '' <EOS>	70.80207838668294
<SOS> `` i will tell you , my lord , on the day when you are willing to hear my confession . '' <EOS>	73.75060260525886
<SOS> `` good ! <EOS>	71.34540062964149
<SOS> at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself , remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution . '' <EOS>	47.55406124087032
<SOS> `` thank you , my lord , '' said the mendicant in a hoarse voice . <EOS>	59.84039156883312
<SOS> `` but i am not yet ready to receive it . '' <EOS>	93.39303201320418
<SOS> `` very well . <EOS>	59.5195111788003
<SOS> adieu . '' <EOS>	51.655475567777856
<SOS> `` adieu , your holiness , '' said the mendicant , opening the door and bending low before the prelate . <EOS>	43.88051210516834
<SOS> chapter xlvii . <EOS>	88.24006140956304
<SOS> the riot . <EOS>	57.54024077435449
<SOS> it was about eleven o'clock at night . <EOS>	54.88693821321313
<SOS> gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris . <EOS>	80.27031467760267
<SOS> the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings ; silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons , whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen . <EOS>	113.6942133992036
<SOS> these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor ; these were the beggars of the court of miracles the agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache , preparing barricades for the morrow . <EOS>	62.54793825128143
<SOS> gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness , on these nocturnal laborers , with a kind of fear ; he asked himself , if , after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens , he should have the power of making them retire again . <EOS>	74.42946315370573
<SOS> he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him . <EOS>	59.411759042025295
<SOS> he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie ; there the aspect changed ; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop ; their doors seemed closed like their shutters , but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men , who seemed fearful of showing what they carried , to enter , closing immediately . <EOS>	91.62089559129863
<SOS> these men were shopkeepers , who had arms to lend to those who had none . <EOS>	92.15379507888423
<SOS> one individual went from door to door , bending under the weight of swords , guns , muskets and every kind of weapon , which he deposited as fast as he could . <EOS>	70.54233491029152
<SOS> by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet . <EOS>	61.100713646029924
<SOS> the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie ; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray , according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie . <EOS>	64.09087615506849
<SOS> they were standing motionless , while single men passed from one group to another . <EOS>	95.4157220302598
<SOS> all these cloaks , gray or black , were raised behind by the point of a sword , or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket . <EOS>	54.50836497010169
<SOS> on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him . <EOS>	50.493725967149096
<SOS> `` who are you ? '' <EOS>	72.8370590296147
<SOS> asked the man . <EOS>	86.5532109200731
<SOS> `` i do not know you for one of us . '' <EOS>	79.74246678865285
<SOS> `` then it is because you do not know your friends , my dear monsieur louvieres , '' said the coadjutor , raising his hat . <EOS>	85.25500210631367
<SOS> louvieres recognized him and bowed . <EOS>	53.23149075474724
<SOS> gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle . <EOS>	82.72497298032444
<SOS> there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls . <EOS>	82.27528923285348
<SOS> they might be said to be a procession of ghosts , for they were all wrapped in white cloaks . <EOS>	98.94295677222075
<SOS> when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated , one after the other , as if the earth had opened under their feet . <EOS>	100.57516236783079
<SOS> gondy , edged into a corner , saw them vanish from the first until the last but one . <EOS>	68.30077730737536
<SOS> the last raised his eyes , to ascertain , doubtless , that neither his companions nor himself had been watched , and , in spite of the darkness , he perceived gondy . <EOS>	51.27970647339467
<SOS> he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat . <EOS>	44.74560880349201
<SOS> `` halloo ! <EOS>	69.50246286450069
<SOS> monsieur de rochefort , '' said gondy , laughing , `` are you a boy to play with firearms ? '' <EOS>	63.44579512901802
<SOS> rochefort recognized the voice . <EOS>	63.11365295429584
<SOS> `` ah , it is you , my lord ! '' <EOS>	94.74148975388152
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	62.46771909243167
<SOS> `` the very same . <EOS>	88.79588662422871
<SOS> what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth ? '' <EOS>	64.68020342448425
<SOS> `` my fifty recruits from the chevalier d'humieres , who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks . '' <EOS>	73.13238428360754
<SOS> `` and where are you going ? '' <EOS>	61.69822873836039
<SOS> `` to the house of one of my friends , a sculptor , only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble . '' <EOS>	76.53688813407716
<SOS> `` very good , '' said gondy , shaking rochefort by the hand , who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him . <EOS>	56.53355194407834
<SOS> it was now one o'clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home . <EOS>	82.5612553392233
<SOS> he opened a window and leaned out to listen . <EOS>	76.85064801612955
<SOS> a strange , incomprehensible , unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city ; one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets , now dark as ocean 's most unfathomable caves . <EOS>	72.43384911533525
<SOS> from time to time a dull sound was heard , like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea ; but nothing clear , nothing distinct , nothing intelligible ; it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake . <EOS>	69.28263291804633
<SOS> the work of revolt continued the whole night thus . <EOS>	78.97741473489532
<SOS> the next morning , on awaking , paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance . <EOS>	72.87345484541892
<SOS> it was like a besieged town . <EOS>	63.23392785492071
<SOS> armed men , shouldering muskets , watched over the barricades with menacing looks ; words of command , patrols , arrests , executions , even , were encountered at every step . <EOS>	59.975780139528474
<SOS> those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry , `` long live broussel ! '' <EOS>	48.670311507971896
<SOS> `` down with mazarin ! '' <EOS>	77.31942884269914
<SOS> and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at , spat upon and even beaten . <EOS>	67.40940203370008
<SOS> they had not yet begun to slay , but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting . <EOS>	100.82534722698631
<SOS> the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal . <EOS>	115.86700923785146
<SOS> from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie , from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf , from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore , there were more than ten thousand armed men ; those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal , the gates of which were closed behind them , a precaution which made their situation precarious . <EOS>	48.15218416831291
<SOS> among these thousands moved , in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred , pale and haggard men , clothed in rags , who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words : `` behold the misery of the people ! '' <EOS>	58.60885168910177
<SOS> wherever these men passed , frenzied cries were heard ; and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions . <EOS>	97.19049356619097
<SOS> the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city , which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil , had awakened to such feverish commotion ; nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them , declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears . <EOS>	61.6967800669207
<SOS> then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced . <EOS>	66.72325719303059
<SOS> mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace ; but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet , trembling all over , locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers . <EOS>	54.6813158542182
<SOS> as for the queen , furious , and left to her own guidance , she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry . <EOS>	63.85318208239377
<SOS> the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing ; and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess . <EOS>	63.72522481370562
<SOS> he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre , but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen , attended by more than five hundred men . <EOS>	86.26656385512304
<SOS> the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay . <EOS>	75.41120615755385
<SOS> but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois . <EOS>	83.26664372967088
<SOS> this time the marshal charged , but he was welcomed by musket shots , while stones fell like hail from all the windows . <EOS>	69.99829840793807
<SOS> he left there three men . <EOS>	70.80308816028221
<SOS> he beat a retreat toward the market , but there he met planchet with his halberdiers ; their halberds were leveled at him threateningly . <EOS>	92.99070360134463
<SOS> he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks , but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore , leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle . <EOS>	115.52550673479794
<SOS> the marshal then entered the rue saint honore , but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache . <EOS>	66.86604918427334
<SOS> they were guarded , not only by armed men , but even by women and children . <EOS>	97.44434827293381
<SOS> master friquet , the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him , had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket . <EOS>	67.6180695144803
<SOS> the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it . <EOS>	117.93122287745544
<SOS> he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade , whilst he and others , remaining on their horses , were to protect the assailants . <EOS>	86.70960281009712
<SOS> the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier , but from behind the beams , from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchet 's halberdiers appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents , and louvieres 's bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie . <EOS>	54.43718908506368
<SOS> the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires , but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was . <EOS>	90.21327865319167
<SOS> he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd . <EOS>	87.56482709091337
<SOS> the guards , more skillful , did greater execution ; but the bourgeois , more numerous , overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron . <EOS>	72.52334270628602
<SOS> men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at lerida . <EOS>	68.66818047370681
<SOS> fontrailles , his aide de camp , had an arm broken ; his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him , maddened by pain . <EOS>	73.54901430280285
<SOS> in short , he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins , when suddenly , in the direction of the rue de l'arbre sec , the crowd opened , crying : `` long live the coadjutor ! '' <EOS>	102.16228250533953
<SOS> and gondy , in surplice and cloak , appeared , moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left , as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu . <EOS>	79.3372255584054
<SOS> all fell to their knees . <EOS>	67.76081513883693
<SOS> the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him . <EOS>	106.30511141791044
<SOS> `` get me out of this , in heaven 's name ! '' <EOS>	72.21780550666601
<SOS> he said , `` or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men . '' <EOS>	59.70340037356641
<SOS> a great tumult arose , in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard . <EOS>	50.99272134779179
<SOS> gondy raised his hand and demanded silence . <EOS>	58.528865342878824
<SOS> all were still . <EOS>	71.41308602996048
<SOS> `` my children , '' he said , `` this is the marechal de la meilleraie , as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself , on returning to the louvre , to demand of the queen , in your name , our broussel 's release . <EOS>	75.23227559707009
<SOS> you pledge yourself to that , marshal ? '' <EOS>	64.77551456946186
<SOS> added gondy , turning to la meilleraie . <EOS>	96.2089662385093
<SOS> `` morbleu ! '' <EOS>	78.46905707454961
<SOS> cried the latter , `` i should say that i do pledge myself to it ! <EOS>	52.601688756029525
<SOS> i had no hope of getting off so easily . '' <EOS>	71.47942203419214
<SOS> `` he gives you his word of honor , '' said gondy . <EOS>	78.90285667023888
<SOS> the marshal raised his hand in token of assent . <EOS>	76.81258854499613
<SOS> `` long live the coadjutor ! '' <EOS>	80.51461942450607
<SOS> cried the crowd . <EOS>	68.61236004292265
<SOS> some voices even added : `` long live the marshal ! '' <EOS>	115.02380795458113
<SOS> but all took up the cry in chorus : `` down with mazarin ! '' <EOS>	65.48610549416188
<SOS> the crowd gave place , the barricade was opened , and the marshal , with the remnant of his company , retreated , preceded by friquet and his bandits , some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet . <EOS>	118.08353908600344
<SOS> it was almost a triumphal procession ; only , behind the guards the barricades were closed again . <EOS>	70.78597077952709
<SOS> the marshal bit his fingers . <EOS>	48.26074230059869
<SOS> in the meantime , as we have said , mazarin was in his closet , putting his affairs in order . <EOS>	85.19848101986754
<SOS> he called for d'artagnan , but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him , d'artagnan not being on service . <EOS>	91.25092835273148
<SOS> in about ten minutes d'artagnan appeared at the door , followed by the inseparable porthos . <EOS>	95.45615536786379
<SOS> `` ah , come in , come in , monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	108.22482956440662
<SOS> cried the cardinal , `` and welcome your friend too . <EOS>	85.4735898541006
<SOS> but what is going on in this accursed paris ? '' <EOS>	94.91530354234365
<SOS> `` what is going on , my lord ? <EOS>	53.96946996049005
<SOS> nothing good , '' replied d'artagnan , shaking his head . <EOS>	59.35905061071576
<SOS> `` the town is in open revolt , and just now , as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon , who is here , and is your humble servant , they wanted in spite of my uniform , or perhaps because of my uniform , to make us cry 'long live broussel ! ' <EOS>	100.44886284145561
<SOS> and must i tell you , my lord what they wished us to cry as well ? '' <EOS>	102.95406370290095
<SOS> `` speak , speak . '' <EOS>	88.21741325204306

<SOS> mazarin smiled , but became very pale . <EOS>	74.65835318782536
<SOS> `` and you did cry ? '' <EOS>	57.82611026620418
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	71.4221957507647
<SOS> `` i'faith , no , '' said d'artagnan ; `` i was not in voice ; monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either . <EOS>	60.8378478842415

<SOS> `` look at my hat and cloak . '' <EOS>	83.06216315902515
<SOS> and d'artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver . <EOS>	89.75284276200989
<SOS> as for porthos 's coat , a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two . <EOS>	86.85989534494827
<SOS> `` diavolo ! '' <EOS>	70.24102098981683
<SOS> said the cardinal , pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration ; `` i should have cried , i should . '' <EOS>	73.83460533244913
<SOS> at this moment the tumult was heard nearer . <EOS>	72.67566990640918
<SOS> mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him . <EOS>	72.69214128935116
<SOS> he had a great desire to go to the window , but he dared not . <EOS>	51.24712379204614
<SOS> `` see what is going on , monsieur d'artagnan , '' said he . <EOS>	76.41576274141862

<SOS> `` oho ! '' <EOS>	74.7290897117865
<SOS> said he , `` what is this ? <EOS>	53.28810231360606

<SOS> in spite of this recommendation , which , owing to the noise , could scarcely have been heard , two or three musket shots resounded , succeeded by a terrible discharge . <EOS>	69.89029085743836
<SOS> the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal , and one of them , passing under d'artagnan 's arm , entered and broke a mirror , in which porthos was complacently admiring himself . <EOS>	98.49464721704405
<SOS> `` alack ! <EOS>	69.65924923762363

<SOS> `` eh , egad , to give up broussel as they demand ! <EOS>	76.00863674567532

<SOS> `` i will go and discuss the matter with the queen . '' <EOS>	64.71637068577841
<SOS> he stopped at the end of the corridor and said : `` i can count upon you , gentlemen , can i not ? '' <EOS>	82.04825132527213
<SOS> `` we do not give ourselves twice over , '' said d'artagnan ; `` we have given ourselves to you ; command , we shall obey . '' <EOS>	53.821192176462
<SOS> `` very well , then , '' said mazarin ; `` enter this cabinet and wait till i come back . '' <EOS>	72.5212879838218

<SOS> chapter xlviii . <EOS>	59.633231568503426
<SOS> the riot becomes a revolution . <EOS>	43.57122557850419
<SOS> the closet into which d'artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only , and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room , whilst the aperture between the two hangings , small as it was , permitted them to see . <EOS>	91.30284605805893
<SOS> the queen was standing in the room , pale with anger ; her self control , however , was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm . <EOS>	71.69748216783098
<SOS> comminges , villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men . <EOS>	102.2654867309468
<SOS> the chancellor sequier , who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly , stood before her , relating how his carriage had been smashed , how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d ' o , that the hotel was immediately invaded , pillaged and devastated ; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry , in which he was secreted by an old woman , together with his brother , the bishop of meaux . <EOS>	73.39708210866162
<SOS> then the danger was so imminent , the rioters came so near , uttering such threats , that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest , so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered . <EOS>	95.24786852952333
<SOS> fortunately , however , he had not been taken ; the people , believing that he had escaped by some back entrance , retired and left him at liberty to retreat . <EOS>	78.67419581185868
<SOS> then , disguised in the clothes of the marquis d ' o , he had left the hotel , stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door . <EOS>	80.81518509101934
<SOS> during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen . <EOS>	103.18258865902263
<SOS> `` well , '' said the queen , when the chancellor had finished speaking ; `` what do you think of it all ? '' <EOS>	73.11396481187792
<SOS> `` i think that matters look very gloomy , madame . '' <EOS>	86.5511105894698
<SOS> `` but what step would you propose to me ? '' <EOS>	68.43836491217826
<SOS> `` i could propose one to your majesty , but i dare not . '' <EOS>	99.97091528158991
<SOS> `` you may , you may , sir , '' said the queen with a bitter smile ; `` you were not so timid once . '' <EOS>	90.38233086677032
<SOS> the chancellor reddened and stammered some words . <EOS>	50.89779850730192
<SOS> `` it is not a question of the past , but of the present , '' said the queen ; `` you said you could give me advice what is it ? '' <EOS>	43.60929022479203
<SOS> `` madame , '' said the chancellor , hesitating , `` it would be to release broussel . '' <EOS>	100.8469643828353
<SOS> the queen , although already pale , became visibly paler and her face was contracted . <EOS>	71.89461903537418
<SOS> `` release broussel ! '' <EOS>	68.98311710499843
<SOS> she cried , `` never ! '' <EOS>	88.89504813803826
<SOS> at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door . <EOS>	58.5285730199416
<SOS> `` ah , there you are , marechal , '' cried anne of austria joyfully . <EOS>	71.1186414300529
<SOS> `` i trust you have brought this rabble to reason . '' <EOS>	54.91940911833311
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied the marechal , `` i have left three men on the pont neuf , four at the halle , six at the corner of the rue de l'arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all . <EOS>	72.14486861872773
<SOS> i have brought away ten or twelve wounded . <EOS>	63.26499220732287
<SOS> i know not where i have left my hat , and in all probability i should have been left with my hat , had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me . '' <EOS>	78.1073772459754
<SOS> `` ah , indeed , '' said the queen , `` it would have much astonished me if that low cur , with his distorted legs , had not been mixed up with all this . '' <EOS>	114.25735992076356
<SOS> `` madame , '' said la meilleraie , `` do not say too much against him before me , for the service he rendered me is still fresh . '' <EOS>	70.74962573017301
<SOS> `` very good , '' said the queen , `` be as grateful as you like , it does not implicate me ; you are here safe and sound , that is all i wished for ; you are not only welcome , but welcome back . '' <EOS>	57.03639267067513
<SOS> `` yes , madame ; but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people . '' <EOS>	54.22912194682417
<SOS> `` the will ! '' <EOS>	87.11841405182214
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , frowning . <EOS>	90.5684703432671
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	55.04121951678709
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	50.117149417394934
<SOS> monsieur marechal , you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission ! '' <EOS>	67.90422477895552
<SOS> the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal . <EOS>	51.99832291657536
<SOS> `` pardon , madame , '' he said , `` i am not a lawyer , i am a mere soldier , and probably , therefore , i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words ; i ought to have said the wishes , and not the will , of the people . <EOS>	46.15032794772993
<SOS> as for what you do me the honor to say , i presume you mean i was afraid ? '' <EOS>	63.81223809309329
<SOS> the queen smiled . <EOS>	55.05280178925325
<SOS> `` well , then , madame , yes , i did feel fear ; and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i can not count how many charges and skirmishes , i own for the third time in my life i was afraid . <EOS>	94.73253839586914
<SOS> yes , and i would rather face your majesty , however threatening your smile , than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence , unless from deepest hell . '' <EOS>	76.78411077334329
<SOS> ( `` bravo , '' said d'artagnan in a whisper to porthos ; `` well answered . '' ) <EOS>	63.51095478882471
<SOS> `` well , '' said the queen , biting her lips , whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise , `` what is the desire of my people ? '' <EOS>	60.85931697815557
<SOS> `` that broussel shall be given up to them , madame . '' <EOS>	100.19755767505072
<SOS> `` never ! '' <EOS>	61.23677288685847
<SOS> said the queen , `` never ! '' <EOS>	85.2892492894979
<SOS> `` your majesty is mistress , '' said la meilleraie , retreating a few steps . <EOS>	51.43433888036907
<SOS> `` where are you going , marechal ? '' <EOS>	90.81711840972845
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	74.88120152145311
<SOS> `` to give your majesty 's reply to those who await it . '' <EOS>	66.47869373416627
<SOS> `` stay , marechal ; i will not appear to parley with rebels . '' <EOS>	66.51728946670583
<SOS> `` madame , i have pledged my word , and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return . '' <EOS>	97.12001880670992
<SOS> anne of austria 's eyes shot glances of fire . <EOS>	108.32421647675595
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	59.820210789523124
<SOS> that is no impediment , sir , '' said she ; `` i have had greater men than you arrested guitant ! '' <EOS>	80.6501366222349
<SOS> mazarin sprang forward . <EOS>	87.92156298094535
<SOS> `` madame , '' said he , `` if i dared in my turn advise `` `` would it be to give up broussel , sir ? <EOS>	94.31964569784132
<SOS> if so , you can spare yourself the trouble . '' <EOS>	77.97301316035882
<SOS> `` no , '' said mazarin ; `` although , perhaps , that counsel is as good as any other . '' <EOS>	95.1883082873948
<SOS> `` then what may it be ? '' <EOS>	58.35154955138539
<SOS> `` to call for monsieur le coadjuteur . '' <EOS>	48.88633914741287
<SOS> `` the coadjutor ! '' <EOS>	71.66243842015547
<SOS> cried the queen , `` that dreadful mischief maker ! <EOS>	85.87605484159272
<SOS> it is he who has raised all this revolt . '' <EOS>	63.184931396146546
<SOS> `` the more reason , '' said mazarin ; `` if he has raised it he can put it down . '' <EOS>	98.46569025600988
<SOS> `` and hold , madame , '' suggested comminges , who was near a window , out of which he could see ; `` hold , the moment is a happy one , for there he is now , giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal . '' <EOS>	60.42736219030645
<SOS> the queen sprang to the window . <EOS>	81.45385986545878
<SOS> `` it is true , '' she said , `` the arch hypocrite see ! '' <EOS>	71.33005815229104
<SOS> `` i see , '' said mazarin , `` that everybody kneels before him , although he be but coadjutor , whilst i , were i in his place , though i am cardinal , should be torn to pieces . <EOS>	71.60382720122311
<SOS> i persist , then , madame , in my wish '' ( he laid an emphasis on the word ) , `` that your majesty should receive the coadjutor . '' <EOS>	114.88635689662615
<SOS> `` and wherefore do you not say , like the rest , your will ? '' <EOS>	51.08003066437516
<SOS> replied the queen , in a low voice . <EOS>	56.532182172962436
<SOS> mazarin bowed . <EOS>	52.46829710351787
<SOS> `` monsieur le marechal , '' said the queen , after a moment 's reflection , `` go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me . '' <EOS>	43.61945492045517
<SOS> `` and what shall i say to the people ? '' <EOS>	59.66827135908269
<SOS> `` that they must have patience , '' said anne , `` as i have . '' <EOS>	84.86386981472502
<SOS> the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply ; he bowed and went out . <EOS>	92.40181185685064
<SOS> ( d'artagnan turned to porthos . <EOS>	62.19738734762042
<SOS> `` how will this end ? '' <EOS>	97.49348715887497
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	51.854675157540775
<SOS> `` we shall soon see , '' said porthos , in his tranquil way . ) <EOS>	70.14670097631415
<SOS> in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone , whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	64.70414312319947
<SOS> ere long the door opened and the marechal entered , followed by the coadjutor . <EOS>	76.458506188113
<SOS> `` there , madame , '' he said , `` is monsieur gondy , who hastens to obey your majesty 's summons . '' <EOS>	56.65375931585631
<SOS> the queen advanced a few steps to meet him , and then stopped , cold , severe , unmoved , with her lower lip scornfully protruded . <EOS>	57.98199150265501
<SOS> gondy bowed respectfully . <EOS>	97.43133687979675
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said the queen , `` what is your opinion of this riot ? '' <EOS>	85.99522950430007
<SOS> `` that it is no longer a riot , madame , '' he replied , `` but a revolt . '' <EOS>	96.60410246268407
<SOS> `` the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel , '' cried anne , unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor , whom she looked upon , and probably with reason , as the promoter of the tumult . <EOS>	79.52740200026015
<SOS> `` revolt ! <EOS>	91.19072515432256
<SOS> thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are , perhaps , the cause of it ; but , wait , wait ! <EOS>	78.6912406912586
<SOS> the king 's authority will put all this to rights . '' <EOS>	89.00156840792118
<SOS> `` was it to tell me that , madame , '' coldly replied gondy , `` that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence ? '' <EOS>	89.16833980581526
<SOS> `` no , my dear coadjutor , '' said mazarin ; `` it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves . '' <EOS>	61.3832746911
<SOS> `` is it true , '' asked gondy , feigning astonishment , `` that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion ? '' <EOS>	95.6333454188042
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the queen , `` it is requested . '' <EOS>	68.43579115728086
<SOS> the coadjutor bowed . <EOS>	64.01269246170654
<SOS> `` your majesty wishes , then `` `` you to say what you would do in her place , '' mazarin hastened to reply . <EOS>	58.55508048590816
<SOS> the coadjutor looked at the queen , who replied by a sign in the affirmative . <EOS>	51.77752331166939
<SOS> `` were i in her majesty 's place , '' said gondy , coldly , `` i should not hesitate ; i should release broussel . '' <EOS>	98.50658457842006
<SOS> `` and if i do not give him up , what think you will be the result ? '' <EOS>	73.56833368988329
<SOS> exclaimed the queen . <EOS>	85.0758365459656
<SOS> `` i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned , '' put in the marechal . <EOS>	50.124545351803874
<SOS> `` it was not your opinion that i asked , '' said the queen , sharply , without even turning around . <EOS>	85.80418215888164
<SOS> `` if it is i whom your majesty interrogates , '' replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner , `` i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal 's opinion in every respect . '' <EOS>	49.09121326011686
<SOS> the color mounted to the queen 's face ; her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips , compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower , were trembling with anger . <EOS>	85.90184673080525
<SOS> mazarin himself , who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household , was alarmed . <EOS>	51.42536809517075
<SOS> `` give up broussel ! '' <EOS>	90.78039806951203
<SOS> she cried ; `` fine counsel , indeed . <EOS>	46.1046336052248

<SOS> one can easily see it comes from a priest . '' <EOS>	90.74436557336315
<SOS> gondy remained firm , and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done ; but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop . <EOS>	67.45844147253706
<SOS> he looked coldly at the queen , who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn . <EOS>	50.51472774135315
<SOS> mazarin , according to his custom , was thinking much and saying little . <EOS>	68.15317955074343
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	65.74084359129763
<SOS> ho ! '' <EOS>	50.245121080508525
<SOS> said he , `` good advice , advice of a friend . <EOS>	75.92611409452955

<SOS> `` it was only a way of speaking . <EOS>	105.28794413791337

<SOS> ( `` this is a council of state , '' d'artagnan remarked to porthos ; `` but we held better ones at la rochelle , with athos and aramis . '' <EOS>	103.6994417935871

<SOS> `` there and elsewhere . '' ) <EOS>	85.7050512236045
<SOS> the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed , still with the same tranquillity : `` madame , if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow . <EOS>	92.8649212774138
<SOS> i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution . '' <EOS>	81.24248087822176
<SOS> `` thus , then , it is your opinion , '' said anne of austria , with a sneer and biting her lips with rage , `` that yesterday 's riot , which to day is already a rebellion , to morrow may become a revolution ? '' <EOS>	114.17702611864972
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' replied the coadjutor , gravely . <EOS>	90.08511734182748
<SOS> `` but if i am to believe you , sir , the people seem to have thrown off all restraint . '' <EOS>	89.02730757434361

<SOS> `` in that case , you , monsieur le coadjuteur , who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us , '' said the queen , ironically , `` will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them . '' <EOS>	54.53312985576792
<SOS> `` perhaps it will be too late , '' said gondy , still unmoved ; `` perhaps i shall have lost all influence ; while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt . '' <EOS>	50.71563445253282

<SOS> the queen 's eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away . <EOS>	71.05147381977073
<SOS> it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger ; she fanned herself , smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down . <EOS>	105.14982811215167
<SOS> gondy , who began to feel uneasy , examined the tapestry with his eyes , touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger , which was hidden under his cloak , was well within reach . <EOS>	71.49292875453723

<SOS> the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed ; only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen . <EOS>	98.23405140402008

<SOS> this rough appeal , marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french , was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy , clever physiognomist as he was , had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued . <EOS>	72.95732701730223
<SOS> the queen , on her part , thus chided , softened immediately and sat down , and in an almost weeping voice , letting her arms fall by her side , said : `` pardon me , sir , and attribute this violence to what i suffer . <EOS>	77.44810198389145

<SOS> mazarin , who at the words , `` it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased , '' had pricked up his ears , thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries , `` down with mazarin , '' and pleased with gondy 's suppression of this fact , he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression : `` madame , credit the coadjutor , who is one of the most able politicians we have ; the first available cardinal 's hat seems to belong already to his noble brow .

<SOS> gondy looked at mazarin , astonished , and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her , but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal . <EOS>	71.74268440624107
<SOS> gondy smiled , the queen 's color rose and mazarin grew even paler . <EOS>	69.3282457120107
<SOS> `` what is that again ? '' <EOS>	104.46962175940415

<SOS> `` pardon , your majesty , '' he cried , `` but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors ; what are your commands ? '' <EOS>	81.21362108464147
<SOS> `` listen , madame , '' said gondy . <EOS>	82.55208806427807
<SOS> the moaning of waves , the noise of thunder , the roaring of a volcano , can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment . <EOS>	86.8153448221202
<SOS> `` what are my commands ? '' <EOS>	71.6773479550831

<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	58.913854893128985
<SOS> comminges went out with a soldier 's passive obedience . <EOS>	97.0144355993178
<SOS> at this moment a monstrous battering was heard . <EOS>	93.63061394724569
<SOS> one of the gates began to yield . <EOS>	70.18737746850208
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	69.8251938723211
<SOS> madame , '' cried mazarin , `` you have ruined us all the king , yourself and me . '' <EOS>	98.12427058925529
<SOS> at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal , anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges . <EOS>	106.34358865483037
<SOS> `` it is too late , '' said mazarin , tearing his hair , `` too late ! '' <EOS>	71.22994791791683

<SOS> hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob . <EOS>	57.796197519847
<SOS> d'artagnan put his hand to his sword , motioning to porthos to follow his example . <EOS>	61.09294783421257

<SOS> cried mazarin to the coadjutor . <EOS>	74.41214061378065
<SOS> gondy sprang to the window and threw it open ; he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men . <EOS>	57.27007155077099
<SOS> `` not a step further , '' he shouted , `` the queen is signing ! '' <EOS>	96.85840385266148
<SOS> `` what are you saying ? '' <EOS>	74.81147995345074
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	47.49226824795112
<SOS> `` the truth , madame , '' said mazarin , placing a pen and a paper before her , `` you must ; '' then he added : `` sign , anne , i implore you i command you . '' <EOS>	82.63432511261007
<SOS> the queen fell into a chair , took the pen and signed . <EOS>	85.71091475564302
<SOS> the people , kept back by louvieres , had not made another step forward ; but the awful murmuring , which indicates an angry people , continued . <EOS>	123.6194206413825
<SOS> the queen had written , `` the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty ; '' and she had signed it . <EOS>	59.70921776125685
<SOS> the coadjutor , whose eyes devoured her slightest movements , seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it , returned to the window and waved it in his hand . <EOS>	59.888895337257985
<SOS> `` this is the order , '' he said . <EOS>	41.48831747866771
<SOS> all paris seemed to shout with joy , and then the air resounded with the cries of `` long live broussel ! '' <EOS>	55.06068918540321
<SOS> `` long live the coadjutor ! '' <EOS>	71.96043554165782
<SOS> `` long live the queen ! '' <EOS>	117.5571555113791
<SOS> cried de gondy ; but the cries which replied to his were poor and few , and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness . <EOS>	99.65300910378588
<SOS> `` and now that you have obtained what you want , go , '' said she , `` monsieur de gondy . '' <EOS>	50.542932793122915
<SOS> `` whenever her majesty has need of me , '' replied the coadjutor , bowing , `` her majesty knows i am at her command . '' <EOS>	103.93883454320063
<SOS> `` ah , cursed priest ! '' <EOS>	62.60425975146537
<SOS> cried anne , when he had retired , stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door , `` one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day . '' <EOS>	63.775472053948775
<SOS> mazarin wished to approach her . <EOS>	97.67928412579506
<SOS> `` leave me ! '' <EOS>	81.1063538202311
<SOS> she exclaimed ; `` you are not a man ! '' <EOS>	69.82868550283231
<SOS> and she went out of the room . <EOS>	53.17150041264851
<SOS> `` it is you who are not a woman , '' muttered mazarin . <EOS>	68.98879097597133
<SOS> then , after a moment of reverie , he remembered where he had left d'artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything . <EOS>	57.887828995244185
<SOS> he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry , which he pushed aside . <EOS>	94.85960596182265
<SOS> the closet was empty . <EOS>	54.51101038859578
<SOS> at the queen 's last word , d'artagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery . <EOS>	45.84855441062684
<SOS> thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down . <EOS>	79.45337983598644
<SOS> `` why did you leave the closet , monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	72.1783069962305
<SOS> asked the cardinal . <EOS>	54.64548766151825
<SOS> `` because , '' replied d'artagnan , `` the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest . '' <EOS>	76.64552136202599
<SOS> `` and you have been here since `` `` about a quarter of an hour , '' said d'artagnan , motioning to porthos not to contradict him . <EOS>	53.90135692981398
<SOS> mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d'artagnan had seen and heard everything ; but he was pleased with his falsehood . <EOS>	82.16693626254987
<SOS> `` decidedly , monsieur d'artagnan , you are the man i have been seeking . <EOS>	56.536463573267916
<SOS> you may reckon upon me and so may your friend . '' <EOS>	85.74578867348193
<SOS> then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile , he re entered his closet more calmly , for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment . <EOS>	94.8624042226826
<SOS> chapter xlix . <EOS>	81.69114981078565
<SOS> misfortune refreshes the memory . <EOS>	59.85427552238363
<SOS> anne of austria returned to her oratory , furious . <EOS>	63.44444305604615
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	54.6254693826333
<SOS> she cried , wringing her beautiful hands , `` what ! <EOS>	58.418921945065215
<SOS> the people have seen monsieur de condé , a prince of the blood royal , arrested by my mother in law , maria de medicis ; they saw my mother in law , their former regent , expelled by the cardinal ; they saw monsieur de vendome , that is to say , the son of henry iv. , a prisoner at vincennes ; and whilst these great personages were imprisoned , insulted and threatened , they said nothing ; and now for a broussel good god ! <EOS>	98.78543069896969
<SOS> what , then , is to become of royalty ? '' <EOS>	63.59512005080568
<SOS> the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question . <EOS>	75.94664158515975
<SOS> the people had made no demonstration for the princes , but they had risen for broussel ; they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves . <EOS>	74.37989271044322
<SOS> during this time mazarin walked up and down the study , glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror , starred in every direction . <EOS>	62.470509088873996
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	66.68826176923436

<SOS> what matters it about broussel it is a name , not a thing . '' <EOS>	51.22314571700723
<SOS> mazarin , clever politician as he was , was for once mistaken ; broussel was a thing , not a name . <EOS>	102.84584764855222
<SOS> the next morning , therefore , when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage , having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle , the people threw themselves in his way and cries of `` long live broussel ! '' <EOS>	54.993108368892365
<SOS> `` long live our father ! '' <EOS>	80.4093874410955
<SOS> resounded from all parts and was death to mazarin 's ears ; and the cardinal 's spies brought bad news from every direction , which greatly agitated the minister , but was calmly received by the queen . <EOS>	96.57421300642633
<SOS> the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke , a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal , who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria . <EOS>	63.40011752682927
<SOS> the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king , queen , and cardinal , all three together . <EOS>	68.60826956203759
<SOS> by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades . <EOS>	78.94603573479559

<SOS> the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other . <EOS>	94.21341967215278
<SOS> no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty . <EOS>	66.30656281973307
<SOS> louvieres was proud and satisfied ; he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his father 's deliverance from prison . <EOS>	72.37982075410903
<SOS> his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal . <EOS>	85.80591072128271
<SOS> laughingly he said to the councillor , restored to his family : `` do you think , father , that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me ? '' <EOS>	77.46151629495095
<SOS> d'artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul , whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot , and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other . <EOS>	55.28132626691605
<SOS> raoul had offered some opposition at first ; but d'artagnan made use of the comte de la fere 's name , and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse , raoul started to rejoin the army . <EOS>	87.33550934845425
<SOS> rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs . <EOS>	55.27609323807013
<SOS> he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive , and he would find paris tranquil . <EOS>	60.76001994877824
<SOS> he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road , but gondy reflected for a moment , and then said : `` let him continue his journey . '' <EOS>	75.09433608217682
<SOS> `` all is not then over ? '' <EOS>	77.56169579320458
<SOS> asked rochefort . <EOS>	107.62277713656513
<SOS> `` my dear count , we have only just begun . '' <EOS>	67.18422668194356
<SOS> `` what induces you to think so ? '' <EOS>	91.20486064486965
<SOS> `` the knowledge that i have of the queen 's heart ; she will not rest contented beaten . '' <EOS>	87.87189133941439
<SOS> `` is she , then , preparing for a stroke ? '' <EOS>	79.7581594753073
<SOS> `` i hope so . '' <EOS>	99.56675904157102
<SOS> `` come , let us see what you know . '' <EOS>	84.88289429525662
<SOS> `` i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army . '' <EOS>	107.24947956258046
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	84.75573755744381
<SOS> ha ! '' <EOS>	70.69085714395749
<SOS> said rochefort , `` you are right . <EOS>	56.28122400956447
<SOS> we must let monsieur de beaufort come . '' <EOS>	96.52533189954664
<SOS> in fact , the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived . <EOS>	81.97367829344867
<SOS> it was a very simple , natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation . <EOS>	65.41071789992357
<SOS> it was said that madame de longueville , for whom the prince had more than a brother 's affection and in whom he had confided , had been indiscreet . <EOS>	65.6797249983179
<SOS> his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen . <EOS>	63.61891162756497
<SOS> even on the night of the prince 's return , some citizens , bolder than the rest , such as the sheriffs , captains and the quartermaster , went from house to house among their friends , saying : `` why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville ? <EOS>	84.79835678555004
<SOS> it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies , who will give him evil counsel ; whereas , brought up by the coadjutor , for instance , he would imbibe national principles and love his people . '' <EOS>	62.83058877841814
<SOS> that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks , the patrols of armed shop people , and the bands of mendicants reappeared . <EOS>	102.58414748932906
<SOS> the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince , who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o'clock in the morning . <EOS>	107.99620893427789
<SOS> at five o'clock anne went to the cardinal 's room . <EOS>	88.82041227136797
<SOS> if she had not yet taken any repose , he at least was already up . <EOS>	72.9846705698578
<SOS> six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt ; he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell , when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen 's apartments . <EOS>	115.9498696931781
<SOS> anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door . <EOS>	78.20134066225191
<SOS> the cardinal therefore rose to open it . <EOS>	57.13209889791519
<SOS> the queen was in a morning gown , but it became her still ; for , like diana of poictiers and ninon , anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful ; nevertheless , this morning she looked handsomer than usual , for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression . <EOS>	61.917002696388764
<SOS> `` what is the matter , madame ? '' <EOS>	56.27903526990698
<SOS> said mazarin , uneasily . <EOS>	55.20952752460382
<SOS> `` you seem secretly elated . '' <EOS>	75.93326533632825
<SOS> `` yes , giulio , '' she said , `` proud and happy ; for i have found the means of strangling this hydra . '' <EOS>	87.10578421902672
<SOS> `` you are a great politician , my queen , '' said mazarin ; `` let us hear the means . '' <EOS>	74.45503041323117
<SOS> and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper . <EOS>	72.45542119936134
<SOS> `` you know , '' said the queen , `` that they want to take the king away from me ? '' <EOS>	84.62603188426424
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	67.94836586193595
<SOS> yes , and to hang me . '' <EOS>	102.47363639071105
<SOS> `` they shall not have the king . '' <EOS>	70.42931231622043
<SOS> `` nor hang me . '' <EOS>	71.77891847417987
<SOS> `` listen . <EOS>	58.654115028406636

<SOS> i wish that this event , which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs , should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself , myself , and a third person . '' <EOS>	83.07135653805521

<SOS> `` and will he aid this project ? '' <EOS>	91.21754866599723
<SOS> `` the plan is his own . '' <EOS>	109.03239009332567
<SOS> `` and paris ? '' <EOS>	68.48347045506007
<SOS> `` he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion . '' <EOS>	81.47413667547907
<SOS> `` the plan is not wanting in grandeur ; i see but one impediment . '' <EOS>	104.80281321615485

<SOS> anne , trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation , left the room , shutting the door violently after her . <EOS>	99.18044391174652
<SOS> mazarin did not even turn around . <EOS>	78.1270544930257
<SOS> when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept ; then suddenly struck with an idea : `` i am saved ! '' <EOS>	76.17797155365932

<SOS> i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris , a man i have too long forgotten . '' <EOS>	90.32813793425672
<SOS> then falling into a reverie , she added , however , with an expression of joy , `` ungrateful woman that i am , for twenty years i have forgotten this man , whom i ought to have made a marechal of france . <EOS>	89.35654667458245
<SOS> my mother in law expended gold , caresses , dignities on concini , who ruined her ; the king made vitry marechal of france for an assassination : while i have left in obscurity , in poverty , the noble d'artagnan , who saved me ! '' <EOS>	73.15117641098806
<SOS> and running to a table , on which were paper , pens and ink , she hastily began to write . <EOS>	72.67147386024612
<SOS> chapter l. the interview . <EOS>	90.76552871699354
<SOS> it had been d'artagnan 's practice , ever since the riots , to sleep in the same room as porthos , and on this eventful morning he was still there , sleeping , and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat , which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles . <EOS>	66.45963821578053
<SOS> as for porthos , he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them . <EOS>	69.15357291045316
<SOS> they were both aroused at seven o'clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant , who brought a letter for d'artagnan . <EOS>	51.6775298380572
<SOS> `` from whom ? '' <EOS>	56.711791678231
<SOS> asked the gascon . <EOS>	71.79359649457191
<SOS> `` from the queen , '' replied the servant . <EOS>	75.95205217883395
<SOS> `` ho ! '' <EOS>	63.35111108484232
<SOS> said porthos , raising himself in his bed ; `` what does she say ? '' <EOS>	64.88591112077609
<SOS> d'artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly , whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes , not daring to ask a single question . <EOS>	66.78833467655541
<SOS> `` friend porthos , '' said d'artagnan , handing the letter to him , `` this time , at least , you are sure of your title of baron , and i of my captaincy . <EOS>	94.9234947090211
<SOS> read for yourself and judge . '' <EOS>	54.24584059484576
<SOS> porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words : `` the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d'artagnan , who must follow the bearer . '' <EOS>	62.878259903488896
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	38.89953836622928
<SOS> exclaimed porthos ; `` i see nothing in that very extraordinary . '' <EOS>	48.367688990544835
<SOS> `` but i see much that is very extraordinary in it , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	87.35633086527308
<SOS> `` it is evident , by their sending for me , that matters are becoming complicated . <EOS>	52.506845420171615
<SOS> just reflect a little what an agitation the queen 's mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years . '' <EOS>	52.478867276766316
<SOS> `` it is true , '' said porthos . <EOS>	69.55217972972984
<SOS> `` sharpen your sword , baron , load your pistols , and give some corn to the horses , for i will answer for it , something lightning like will happen ere to morrow . '' <EOS>	67.61669176537926
<SOS> `` but , stop ; do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us ? '' <EOS>	86.27016254307689
<SOS> suggested porthos , incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people . <EOS>	74.41774048333976
<SOS> `` if it is a snare , '' replied d'artagnan , `` i shall scent it out , be assured . <EOS>	78.27260268296813
<SOS> if mazarin is an italian , i am a gascon . '' <EOS>	74.43501666097706
<SOS> and d'artagnan dressed himself in an instant . <EOS>	50.2005023928204
<SOS> whilst porthos , still in bed , was hooking on his cloak for him , a second knock at the door was heard . <EOS>	109.67909712446371
<SOS> `` come in , '' exclaimed d'artagnan ; and another servant entered . <EOS>	75.02288071683272
<SOS> `` from his eminence , cardinal mazarin , '' presenting a letter . <EOS>	49.6450927510858
<SOS> d'artagnan looked at porthos . <EOS>	81.27849573229331
<SOS> `` a complicated affair , '' said porthos ; `` where will you begin ? '' <EOS>	63.3170549518713
<SOS> `` it is arranged capitally ; his eminence expects me in half an hour . '' <EOS>	88.56203260662305
<SOS> `` good . '' <EOS>	76.0293118013614
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said d'artagnan , turning to the servant , `` tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command . '' <EOS>	62.349025754161126
<SOS> `` it is very fortunate , '' resumed the gascon , when the valet had retired , `` that he did not meet the other one . '' <EOS>	69.95462523881082
<SOS> `` do you not think that they have sent for you , both for the same thing ? '' <EOS>	72.54856974540635
<SOS> `` i do not think it , i am certain of it . '' <EOS>	50.88762535946022
<SOS> `` quick , quick , d'artagnan . <EOS>	64.90136331751948
<SOS> remember that the queen awaits you , and after the queen , the cardinal , and after the cardinal , myself . '' <EOS>	76.74290733419056
<SOS> d'artagnan summoned anne of austria 's servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen 's presence . <EOS>	76.26146818429706
<SOS> the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu ; then they gained the private staircase and d'artagnan was ushered into the oratory . <EOS>	55.08703774398712
<SOS> a certain emotion , for which he could not account , made the lieutenant 's heart beat : he had no longer the assurance of youth ; experience had taught him the importance of past events . <EOS>	80.37228166334457
<SOS> formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman ; but now it was a different thing ; he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general . <EOS>	88.10470531093328
<SOS> the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk , and d'artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand , which , by its form , its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss . <EOS>	73.26895652086363
<SOS> the queen entered . <EOS>	94.24873478239108
<SOS> `` it is you , monsieur d'artagnan , '' she said , fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer , `` and i know you well . <EOS>	76.29659100000754
<SOS> look at me well in your turn . <EOS>	52.187944782256814
<SOS> i am the queen ; do you recognize me ? '' <EOS>	76.71507937576723
<SOS> `` no , madame , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	66.32344662311758
<SOS> `` but are you no longer aware , '' continued anne , giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will , `` that in former days the queen had once need of a young , brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that , although he might have thought that she had forgotten him , she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart ? '' <EOS>	69.27631661739423
<SOS> `` no , madame , i was ignorant of that , '' said the musketeer . <EOS>	59.46997633831351
<SOS> `` so much the worse , sir , '' said anne of austria ; `` so much the worse , at least for the queen , for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion . '' <EOS>	64.58166022380163
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	108.01135381077155
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , `` does the queen , surrounded as she is by such devoted servants , such wise counselors , men , in short , so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier ? '' <EOS>	89.08175514673766
<SOS> anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it . <EOS>	57.64108022185874
<SOS> she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman . <EOS>	47.54439160538772
<SOS> she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity . <EOS>	73.52435843378669
<SOS> `` all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded , monsieur d'artagnan , is doubtless true , '' said the queen , `` but i have confidence in you alone . <EOS>	51.019252808423985
<SOS> i know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune . <EOS>	45.44458497619485
<SOS> come , will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen ? '' <EOS>	68.53862068872863
<SOS> `` i will do everything your majesty commands , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	72.13153618187674
<SOS> the queen reflected for a moment and then , seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer : `` perhaps you like repose ? '' <EOS>	64.64972440380193
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	62.228793603256875
<SOS> `` i do not know , for i have never had it , madame . '' <EOS>	59.96026380080261
<SOS> `` have you any friends ? '' <EOS>	89.38137202494005
<SOS> `` i had three , two of whom have left paris , to go i know not where . <EOS>	78.07675352405009
<SOS> one alone is left to me , but he is one of those known , i believe , to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak . '' <EOS>	69.33575486204045
<SOS> `` very good , '' said the queen ; `` you and your friend are worth an army . '' <EOS>	60.03856497145161
<SOS> `` what am i to do , madame ? '' <EOS>	56.8395161585849
<SOS> `` return at five o'clock and i will tell you ; but do not breathe to a living soul , sir , the rendezvous which i give you . '' <EOS>	50.768540643322815
<SOS> `` no , madame . '' <EOS>	102.1640110334618
<SOS> `` swear it upon the cross . '' <EOS>	40.540024200059996
<SOS> `` madame , i have never been false to my word ; when i say i will not do a thing , i mean it . '' <EOS>	70.73094959356953
<SOS> the queen , although astonished at this language , to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers , argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d'artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project . <EOS>	70.25112270088624
<SOS> it was one of the gascon 's artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty . <EOS>	81.9706319325445
<SOS> `` has the queen any further commands for me now ? '' <EOS>	80.51905758653696
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	57.808516202278746
<SOS> `` no , sir , '' replied anne of austria , `` and you may retire until the time that i mentioned to you . '' <EOS>	51.1694374727934
<SOS> d'artagnan bowed and went out . <EOS>	66.35898028856866
<SOS> `` diable ! '' <EOS>	97.04925480714
<SOS> he exclaimed when the door was shut , `` they seem to have the greatest need of me just now . '' <EOS>	56.96454240761644
<SOS> then , as the half hour had already glided by , he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal 's door . <EOS>	65.91735939718588
<SOS> bernouin introduced him . <EOS>	60.524144223203024
<SOS> `` i come for your commands , my lord , '' he said . <EOS>	65.18720123522823
<SOS> and according to his custom d'artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him . <EOS>	93.86492542878564
<SOS> but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed . <EOS>	65.2709587822087
<SOS> `` you come from the queen ? '' <EOS>	58.007680771156956
<SOS> said mazarin , looking fixedly at d'artagnan . <EOS>	68.31449019541238
<SOS> `` i ! <EOS>	78.02005915763208
<SOS> my lord who told you that ? '' <EOS>	85.09421749412313
<SOS> `` nobody , but i know it . '' <EOS>	89.09551131950901
<SOS> `` i regret infinitely to tell you , my lord , that you are mistaken , '' replied the gascon , impudently , firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria . <EOS>	64.37386192881505
<SOS> `` i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor . '' <EOS>	101.97251815060847
<SOS> `` because i was shown up the private stairs . '' <EOS>	115.66021653696544
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	56.606930320762274
<SOS> `` i know not ; it must have been a mistake . '' <EOS>	91.53053117399601
<SOS> mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d'artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding , so he gave up , for the time , the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing . <EOS>	89.0570161198622
<SOS> `` let us speak of my affairs , '' said mazarin , `` since you will tell me naught of yours . <EOS>	50.5382491127794
<SOS> are you fond of traveling ? '' <EOS>	89.17675805211113
<SOS> `` my life has been passed on the high road . '' <EOS>	52.0245930792088
<SOS> `` would anything retain you particularly in paris ? '' <EOS>	43.05182015886511
<SOS> `` nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris . '' <EOS>	84.04998300167021
<SOS> `` very well . <EOS>	104.3229112397023
<SOS> here is a letter , which must be taken to its address . '' <EOS>	92.56915735123081
<SOS> `` to its address , my lord ? <EOS>	98.24640396018356
<SOS> but it has none . '' <EOS>	66.3791268011533
<SOS> in fact , the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank . <EOS>	64.60749477059919
<SOS> `` i must tell you , '' resumed mazarin , `` that it is in a double envelope . '' <EOS>	101.22161456035775
<SOS> `` i understand ; and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place ? '' <EOS>	93.78971082931899
<SOS> `` just so , take it and go . <EOS>	94.14226798476903
<SOS> you have a friend , monsieur du vallon , whom i like much ; let him accompany you . '' <EOS>	82.4503013314726
<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	91.4275272059216
<SOS> said d'artagnan to himself . <EOS>	73.17241942638451
<SOS> `` he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris . '' <EOS>	48.50909433835146
<SOS> `` do you hesitate ? '' <EOS>	61.889240190722724
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	92.12355834874211
<SOS> `` no , my lord , and i will set out at once . <EOS>	99.59328832066824
<SOS> there is one thing only which i must request . '' <EOS>	93.05361363109299
<SOS> `` what is it ? <EOS>	63.942429271935914
<SOS> speak . '' <EOS>	49.872766169925406
<SOS> `` that your eminence will go at once to the queen . '' <EOS>	67.44993373224926
<SOS> `` what for ? '' <EOS>	39.689987988199974
<SOS> `` merely to say these words : ' i am going to send monsieur d'artagnan away and i wish him to set out directly . ' '' <EOS>	47.72254707715632
<SOS> `` i told you , '' said mazarin , `` that you had seen the queen . '' <EOS>	47.946389581328646
<SOS> `` i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake . '' <EOS>	79.048772248832
<SOS> `` what is the meaning of that ? '' <EOS>	76.88894279554309
<SOS> `` may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence ? '' <EOS>	62.72114528695788
<SOS> `` very well ; i will go . <EOS>	64.74069280593393
<SOS> wait here for me . '' <EOS>	60.37979767797113
<SOS> and looking attentively around him , to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets , mazarin went out . <EOS>	87.73064275850355
<SOS> ten minutes elapsed , during which d'artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second . <EOS>	64.21582344030345
<SOS> but he did not succeed . <EOS>	56.784525473624946
<SOS> mazarin returned , pale , and evidently thoughtful . <EOS>	71.83854513966149
<SOS> he seated himself at his desk and d'artagnan proceeded to examine his face , as he had just examined the letter he held , but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter . <EOS>	42.77946218360538
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	84.50056696645417
<SOS> thought the gascon ; `` he looks displeased . <EOS>	64.89945463430541
<SOS> can it be with me ? <EOS>	41.06755473761749
<SOS> he meditates . <EOS>	75.2405086968014
<SOS> is it about sending me to the bastile ? <EOS>	65.15977145061198
<SOS> all very fine , my lord , but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist . <EOS>	96.55397350672693
<SOS> i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus . <EOS>	56.75211502466154
<SOS> it would be exceedingly droll . '' <EOS>	74.35269752509735
<SOS> the gascon , with his vivid imagination , had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation . <EOS>	99.16618945304032
<SOS> mazarin gave , however , no order of the kind , but on the contrary began to be insinuating . <EOS>	54.03213124366984
<SOS> `` you were right , '' he said , `` my dear monsieur d'artagnan , and you can not set out yet . <EOS>	77.13646189394123
<SOS> i beg you to return me that dispatch . '' <EOS>	47.05915405689695
<SOS> d'artagnan obeyed , and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact . <EOS>	89.98132422314906
<SOS> `` i shall want you this evening , '' he said `` return in two hours . '' <EOS>	48.863349083488856
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss . '' <EOS>	91.30286640448375
<SOS> `` do not be uneasy , '' said mazarin ; `` it is the same . '' <EOS>	43.31517270638379
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	104.28956976827793
<SOS> thought d'artagnan ; `` i fancied it was so . '' <EOS>	76.97885011122312
<SOS> `` return , then , at five o'clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you . <EOS>	82.93359542439924
<SOS> only , leave him in the ante room , as i wish to speak to you alone . '' <EOS>	58.74812846227865
<SOS> d'artagnan bowed , and thought : `` both at the same hour ; both commands alike ; both at the palais royal . <EOS>	93.41067865414588
<SOS> monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret ! '' <EOS>	71.52975752284107
<SOS> `` you are thoughtful , '' said mazarin , uneasily . <EOS>	101.9541967233741
<SOS> `` yes , i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not . '' <EOS>	67.81366659663068
<SOS> `` armed to the teeth ! '' <EOS>	54.78996181832546
<SOS> replied mazarin . <EOS>	58.05147691704494
<SOS> `` very well , my lord ; it shall be so . '' <EOS>	52.588520407044705
<SOS> d'artagnan saluted , went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin 's flattering promises , which gave porthos an indescribable happiness . <EOS>	75.88014668520928
<SOS> chapter li . <EOS>	82.67477921519017
<SOS> the flight . <EOS>	76.51663658801704
<SOS> when d'artagnan returned to the palais royal at five o'clock , it presented , in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town , a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing . <EOS>	63.10644751259715
<SOS> nor was that surprising . <EOS>	53.748118546479645
<SOS> the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear , since the people had nothing more just then to ask for . <EOS>	118.60794164253238
<SOS> the return , also , of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet . <EOS>	58.41601375606047
<SOS> the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon ; then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment . <EOS>	57.9032401005034
<SOS> anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit . <EOS>	101.0531763083042
<SOS> mazarin disappeared as they rose from table . <EOS>	40.42898114278847
<SOS> he found d'artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room . <EOS>	78.61207222452266
<SOS> the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study . <EOS>	78.64999890361754
<SOS> `` my dear m. d'artagnan , '' said the minister , sitting down , `` i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer . '' <EOS>	88.98582258128233
<SOS> `` i hope , '' said d'artagnan , bowing , `` that you give it , my lord , without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it . '' <EOS>	57.13216709666134
<SOS> `` more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend ; therefore i apply to you . <EOS>	48.29969943197978
<SOS> we are about to leave this evening , '' continued mazarin . <EOS>	99.27254824722998
<SOS> `` my dear m. d'artagnan , the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands . '' <EOS>	75.398339458454
<SOS> he paused . <EOS>	42.44775956212719
<SOS> `` explain yourself , my lord , i am listening . '' <EOS>	116.7586914712891
<SOS> `` the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain . '' <EOS>	56.78037791540651
<SOS> `` aha ! '' <EOS>	63.42003702052861
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` that is to say , the queen wishes to leave paris . '' <EOS>	66.68388812046523
<SOS> `` a woman 's caprice you understand . '' <EOS>	65.93432710095283
<SOS> `` yes , i understand perfectly , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	69.65207464380505
<SOS> `` it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o'clock . '' <EOS>	61.061217505070665
<SOS> `` was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one ? '' <EOS>	71.24485784345741
<SOS> muttered d'artagnan . <EOS>	89.67929236183228
<SOS> `` oh , women ! <EOS>	81.51493549229326
<SOS> women ! <EOS>	77.8853001130514

<SOS> `` i , my lord ? '' <EOS>	80.63704750016812
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` why should i ? '' <EOS>	69.42998518891339
<SOS> `` because you shrug your shoulders . '' <EOS>	80.75299836593229
<SOS> `` it is a way i have of speaking to myself . <EOS>	55.130373906554816
<SOS> i neither approve nor disapprove , my lord ; i merely await your commands . '' <EOS>	103.13353121076385
<SOS> `` good ; it is you , accordingly , that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain . '' <EOS>	64.25482355402012
<SOS> `` liar ! '' <EOS>	48.794398839839495
<SOS> thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	97.27015302911138
<SOS> `` you see , therefore , '' continued the cardinal , perceiving d'artagnan 's composure , `` that , as i have told you , the welfare of the state is placed in your hands . '' <EOS>	98.75982381654306
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge . '' <EOS>	99.33591378654096
<SOS> `` you accept , however ? '' <EOS>	67.26280062022767
<SOS> `` i always accept . '' <EOS>	57.54409181796476
<SOS> `` do you think the thing possible ? '' <EOS>	43.30498497142276
<SOS> `` everything is possible . '' <EOS>	66.9984466837502
<SOS> `` shall you be attacked on the road ? '' <EOS>	54.33007514661463
<SOS> `` probably . '' <EOS>	69.92466542974795
<SOS> `` and what will you do in that case ? '' <EOS>	78.12817638126393
<SOS> `` i shall pass through those who attack me . '' <EOS>	73.5260112080694
<SOS> `` and suppose you can not pass through them ? '' <EOS>	80.15040721365592
<SOS> `` so much the worse for them ; i shall pass over them . '' <EOS>	54.79195015495425
<SOS> `` and you will place the king and queen in safety also , at saint germain ? '' <EOS>	90.0867091368673
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	51.82134079768519
<SOS> `` on your life ? '' <EOS>	93.33133161899426
<SOS> `` on my life . '' <EOS>	86.46160340445311
<SOS> `` you are a hero , my friend , '' said mazarin , gazing at the musketeer with admiration . <EOS>	91.1252116651054
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled . <EOS>	108.47890398707679
<SOS> `` and i ? '' <EOS>	101.10691582862461
<SOS> asked mazarin , after a moment 's silence . <EOS>	86.84621342464965
<SOS> `` how ? <EOS>	79.08428513621449
<SOS> and you , my lord ? '' <EOS>	95.65482483847293
<SOS> `` if i wish to leave ? '' <EOS>	64.81899736580284
<SOS> `` that would be much more difficult . '' <EOS>	83.82606115551157
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	79.00314862338068
<SOS> `` your eminence might be recognized . '' <EOS>	83.93094479312207
<SOS> `` even under this disguise ? '' <EOS>	48.30375872355015
<SOS> asked mazarin , raising a cloak which covered an arm chair , upon which lay a complete dress for an officer , of pearl gray and red , entirely embroidered with silver . <EOS>	67.5671175482516
<SOS> `` if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy . '' <EOS>	92.27212953438892
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	58.55855364883248
<SOS> said mazarin , breathing more freely . <EOS>	65.06269449825768
<SOS> `` but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry , 'down with mazarin ! ' '' <EOS>	68.96132765622987
<SOS> `` i will : 'down with mazarin ' '' `` in french , in good french , my lord , take care of your accent ; they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly . <EOS>	75.09836427451397
<SOS> take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vespers . '' <EOS>	79.47097297128815
<SOS> `` i will do my best . '' <EOS>	104.5574053390923
<SOS> `` the streets are full of armed men , '' continued d'artagnan . <EOS>	63.697870507561234
<SOS> `` are you sure that no one is aware of the queen 's project ? '' <EOS>	62.31354258981662
<SOS> mazarin reflected . <EOS>	64.74780425698819
<SOS> `` this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor , my lord ; the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything . '' <EOS>	75.53233836806285
<SOS> mazarin shuddered , but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first . <EOS>	45.958831359667705
<SOS> `` and therefore , '' added he , quietly , `` i have not confidence in every one ; the proof of which is , that i have fixed upon you to escort me . '' <EOS>	79.315053541374
<SOS> `` shall you not go with the queen ? '' <EOS>	62.75143706705175
<SOS> `` no , '' replied mazarin . <EOS>	48.042661011782016
<SOS> `` then you will start after the queen ? '' <EOS>	48.74168998986701
<SOS> `` no , '' said mazarin again . <EOS>	93.73302692962557
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	70.7375018062251
<SOS> said d'artagnan , who began to understand . <EOS>	48.600240888773385
<SOS> `` yes , '' continued the cardinal . <EOS>	62.7884310777752
<SOS> `` i have my plan . <EOS>	95.36631125692239
<SOS> with the queen i double her risk ; after the queen her departure would double mine ; then , the court once safe , i might be forgotten . <EOS>	53.23456985888038
<SOS> the great are often ungrateful . '' <EOS>	61.600349963087886
<SOS> `` very true , '' said d'artagnan , fixing his eyes , in spite of himself , on the queen 's diamond , which mazarin wore on his finger . <EOS>	88.28183536861488
<SOS> mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside . <EOS>	111.192033318861
<SOS> `` i wish , '' he said , with his cunning smile , `` to prevent them from being ungrateful to me . '' <EOS>	97.29827742741772
<SOS> `` it is but christian charity , '' replied d'artagnan , `` not to lead one 's neighbors into temptation . '' <EOS>	51.482033533860026
<SOS> `` it is exactly for that reason , '' said mazarin , `` that i wish to start before them . '' <EOS>	82.9498284684494
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian . <EOS>	46.81750271501002
<SOS> mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment . <EOS>	104.72946884194782
<SOS> `` you will begin , therefore , by taking me first out of paris , will you not , my dear m . <EOS>	54.97767875875429
<SOS> d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	118.95224393454347
<SOS> `` a difficult commission , my lord , '' replied d'artagnan , resuming his serious manner . <EOS>	70.61267652495313
<SOS> `` but , '' said mazarin , `` you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen . '' <EOS>	78.98328145179538
<SOS> `` the king and the queen are my king and queen , '' replied the musketeer , `` my life is theirs and i must give it for them . <EOS>	64.1727692900897
<SOS> if they ask it what have i to say ? '' <EOS>	87.36818843749698
<SOS> `` that is true , '' murmured mazarin , in a low tone , `` but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it , must i not ? '' <EOS>	48.33695758441944
<SOS> and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again . <EOS>	77.22694756867024
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled . <EOS>	43.10168690971554
<SOS> these two men met at one point and that was , cunning ; had they been actuated equally by courage , the one would have done great things for the other . <EOS>	87.70295799031383
<SOS> `` but , also , '' said mazarin , `` you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful . '' <EOS>	81.94605343742323
<SOS> `` is it still only an intention , your eminence ? '' <EOS>	69.59794777323708
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	94.2859372520767
<SOS> `` stay , '' said mazarin , drawing the ring from his finger , `` my dear d'artagnan , there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly , it is but just it should return to you ; take it , i pray . '' <EOS>	53.561150454580336
<SOS> d'artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting , and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water , he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure . <EOS>	53.409832796192966
<SOS> `` i valued it much , '' said mazarin , giving a last look at it ; `` nevertheless , i give it to you with great pleasure . '' <EOS>	53.36701075106101
<SOS> `` and i , my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` accept it as it is given . <EOS>	75.32026248141297
<SOS> come , let us speak of your little affairs . <EOS>	54.421139893990954
<SOS> you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour ? '' <EOS>	84.64025360441728
<SOS> `` at ten o'clock . '' <EOS>	101.02986682469094
<SOS> `` and the queen , at what time is it her wish to start ? '' <EOS>	62.76968508435984
<SOS> `` at midnight . '' <EOS>	65.26972538480878
<SOS> `` then it is possible . <EOS>	79.790606621675
<SOS> i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere , and can return for her . '' <EOS>	44.994547217269584
<SOS> `` capital ; but how will you get me out of paris ? '' <EOS>	60.805653966336116
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	80.78680160783023
<SOS> as to that , you must leave it to me . '' <EOS>	104.83000559452414
<SOS> `` i give you absolute power , therefore ; take as large an escort as you like . '' <EOS>	80.12196805386675
<SOS> d'artagnan shook his head . <EOS>	64.18956007440694
<SOS> `` it seems to me , however , '' said mazarin , `` the safest method . '' <EOS>	75.56815694715944
<SOS> `` yes , for you , my lord , but not for the queen ; you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking . '' <EOS>	104.0064234123821
<SOS> `` nevertheless `` `` or find some one else , '' continued d'artagnan , turning his back . <EOS>	60.88770186199808
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	84.82686446910492
<SOS> muttered mazarin , `` i do believe he is going off with the diamond ! <EOS>	99.2594114980005
<SOS> m. d'artagnan , my dear m. d'artagnan , '' he called out in a coaxing voice , `` will you answer for everything ? '' <EOS>	81.33770490519628
<SOS> `` i will answer for nothing . <EOS>	91.99668630241909
<SOS> i will do my best . '' <EOS>	96.15045856284178
<SOS> `` well , then , let us go i must trust to you . '' <EOS>	57.87352915614307
<SOS> `` it is very fortunate , '' said d'artagnan to himself . <EOS>	71.50518861090174
<SOS> `` you will be here at half past nine . '' <EOS>	73.1955748511498
<SOS> `` and i shall find your eminence ready ? '' <EOS>	88.45121100003973
<SOS> `` certainly , quite ready . '' <EOS>	83.83573435225858
<SOS> `` well , then , it is a settled thing ; and now , my lord , will you obtain for me an audience with the queen ? '' <EOS>	72.50473351908941
<SOS> `` for what purpose ? '' <EOS>	101.84585382699775
<SOS> `` i wish to receive her majesty 's commands from her own lips . '' <EOS>	79.5388270469353
<SOS> `` she desired me to give them to you . '' <EOS>	95.27752153995154
<SOS> `` she may have forgotten something . '' <EOS>	57.85963666518776
<SOS> `` you really wish to see her ? '' <EOS>	92.82878460430963
<SOS> `` it is indispensable , my lord . '' <EOS>	77.5830579310239
<SOS> mazarin hesitated for one instant , but d'artagnan was firm . <EOS>	62.80295979928454
<SOS> `` come , then , '' said the minister ; `` i will conduct you to her , but remember , not one word of our conversation . '' <EOS>	83.37851852155205
<SOS> `` what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone , my lord , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	47.48876062922496
<SOS> `` swear to be mute . '' <EOS>	73.13236513786718
<SOS> `` i never swear , my lord , i say yes or no ; and , as i am a gentleman , i keep my word . '' <EOS>	49.72210635331564
<SOS> `` come , then , i see that i must trust unreservedly to you . '' <EOS>	64.86096829167742
<SOS> `` believe me , my lord , it will be your best plan . '' <EOS>	69.78873841336862
<SOS> `` come , '' said mazarin , conducting d'artagnan into the queen 's oratory and desiring him to wait there . <EOS>	102.19300282179864
<SOS> he did not wait long , for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume . <EOS>	94.22009307264332
<SOS> thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age . <EOS>	86.42095588163767
<SOS> she was still exceedingly handsome . <EOS>	80.3277099271495
<SOS> `` it is you , monsieur d'artagnan , '' she said , smiling graciously ; `` i thank you for having insisted on seeing me . '' <EOS>	98.95926970406357
<SOS> `` i ought to ask your majesty 's pardon , but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth . '' <EOS>	72.40631155746111
<SOS> `` do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you ? '' <EOS>	58.79019708995371
<SOS> `` with gratitude . '' <EOS>	79.0999594595134
<SOS> `` very well , be here at midnight . '' <EOS>	103.16194973053658
<SOS> `` i will not fail . '' <EOS>	44.03118498356633
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' continued the queen , `` i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment , but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first . '' <EOS>	84.11567011197548
<SOS> `` your majesty is free to forget or to remember , as it pleases you ; and i know not what you mean , '' said d'artagnan , bowing . <EOS>	67.12106577803674
<SOS> `` go , sir , '' said the queen , with her most bewitching smile , `` go and return at midnight . '' <EOS>	100.22827026871855
<SOS> and d'artagnan retired , but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper . <EOS>	76.43817557100532
<SOS> `` good , '' thought he ; `` mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him . <EOS>	63.20945916727121
<SOS> in truth , that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man . '' <EOS>	80.72300759685602
<SOS> d'artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o'clock he entered the ante room . <EOS>	85.22178005202323
<SOS> he found the cardinal dressed as an officer , and he looked very well in that costume , which , as we have already said , he wore elegantly ; only he was very pale and trembled slightly . <EOS>	52.35479621601632
<SOS> `` quite alone ? '' <EOS>	60.53590588407328
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	88.66036607726582
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	41.07707598184519
<SOS> `` and that worthy monsieur du vallon , are we not to enjoy his society ? '' <EOS>	72.90051573802847
<SOS> `` certainly , my lord ; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal . '' <EOS>	78.8022984430122
<SOS> `` and we start in his carriage , then ? '' <EOS>	82.85156625476505
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	101.04151814710693
<SOS> `` and with us no other escort but you two ? '' <EOS>	62.93361582741442
<SOS> `` is it not enough ? <EOS>	74.4832160188058
<SOS> one of us would suffice . '' <EOS>	79.45965767917576
<SOS> `` really , my dear monsieur d'artagnan , '' said the cardinal , `` your coolness startles me . '' <EOS>	53.997768437463584
<SOS> `` i should have thought , on the contrary , that it ought to have inspired you with confidence . '' <EOS>	71.04565317818538
<SOS> `` and bernouin do i not take him with me ? '' <EOS>	93.81684893883273
<SOS> `` there is no room for him , he will rejoin your eminence . '' <EOS>	74.92668320361102
<SOS> `` let us go , '' said mazarin , `` since everything must be done as you wish . '' <EOS>	84.1219202378976
<SOS> `` my lord , there is time to draw back , '' said d'artagnan , `` and your eminence is perfectly free . '' <EOS>	61.733870536752534
<SOS> `` not at all , not at all , '' said mazarin ; `` let us be off . '' <EOS>	51.32213999092972
<SOS> and so they descended the private stair , mazarin leaning on the arm of d'artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling . <EOS>	59.68430912485822
<SOS> at last , after crossing the courts of the palais royal , where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests , they entered the garden and reached the little gate . <EOS>	59.12828240727145
<SOS> mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket , but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole . <EOS>	59.138967724743274
<SOS> `` give it to me , '' said d'artagnan , who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket , reckoning upon returning by that gate . <EOS>	45.03951513974727
<SOS> the steps were already down and the door open . <EOS>	61.912305118590794
<SOS> mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage . <EOS>	111.51897156106655
<SOS> `` mount , my lord , '' said d'artagnan to mazarin , who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding . <EOS>	50.15445541090832
<SOS> d'artagnan followed him , and mousqueton , having closed the door , mounted behind the carriage with many groans . <EOS>	92.90726644156904
<SOS> he had made some difficulties about going , under pretext that he still suffered from his wound , but d'artagnan had said to him : `` remain if you like , my dear monsieur mouston , but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night ; '' upon which mousqueton had declared , without asking anything further , that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d'artagnan to the end of the world . <EOS>	51.81327553333267
<SOS> the carriage started at a measured pace , without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry . <EOS>	75.05804302053407
<SOS> the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him . <EOS>	112.04156982683084
<SOS> on his left was porthos , whilst d'artagnan was on his right ; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side . <EOS>	47.13961592674757
<SOS> before him , on the front seat , lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d'artagnan . <EOS>	73.73152011871386
<SOS> about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage . <EOS>	54.40321280254373
<SOS> `` who goes ? '' <EOS>	64.78476225636247
<SOS> asked the captain . <EOS>	70.62794420162012
<SOS> `` mazarin ! '' <EOS>	98.5029075331361
<SOS> replied d'artagnan , bursting into a laugh . <EOS>	67.16161003249769
<SOS> the cardinal 's hair stood on end . <EOS>	67.29473321010278
<SOS> but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens , who , seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed , would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence . <EOS>	68.57810998244624
<SOS> `` a good journey to ye , '' they cried , allowing it to pass . <EOS>	72.56354380069523
<SOS> `` hem ! '' <EOS>	71.11981551376482
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` what does my lord think of that reply ? '' <EOS>	120.05137383257535
<SOS> `` man of talent ! '' <EOS>	106.54931773261183
<SOS> cried mazarin . <EOS>	57.9168325903007
<SOS> `` in truth , '' said porthos , `` i understand ; but now `` about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol . <EOS>	65.6187101491209
<SOS> `` who goes there ? '' <EOS>	53.06863991521391
<SOS> inquired the captain of the patrol . <EOS>	70.46917622823902
<SOS> `` keep back , my lord , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	43.269991919679875
<SOS> and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared , completely hidden between them . <EOS>	68.41607861980775
<SOS> `` who goes there ? '' <EOS>	86.52652085384914
<SOS> cried the same voice , impatiently whilst d'artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses ' heads . <EOS>	68.51553338975269
<SOS> but putting his head out of the carriage : `` eh ! <EOS>	74.67405443787796
<SOS> planchet , '' said he . <EOS>	102.39446960943712
<SOS> the chief approached , and it was indeed planchet ; d'artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant . <EOS>	61.75102746768
<SOS> `` how , sir ! '' <EOS>	49.52518658774446
<SOS> said planchet , `` is it you ? '' <EOS>	105.29208552195009
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	73.49681861269725
<SOS> mon dieu ! <EOS>	57.528743336919334
<SOS> yes , my good friend , this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud . '' <EOS>	85.37312681796129
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	52.648003033875746
<SOS> really , '' said planchet . <EOS>	47.47527162356003
<SOS> `` porthos , '' said d'artagnan , `` if you can still speak , say a word , my dear porthos , to this good planchet . '' <EOS>	81.24965508755686
<SOS> `` planchet , my friend , '' said porthos , in a melancholy voice , `` i am very ill ; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me . '' <EOS>	76.12311660754796
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	58.30788271627326
<SOS> good heaven , '' said planchet , `` what a misfortune ! <EOS>	70.09209891513113
<SOS> and how did it happen ? '' <EOS>	65.44242183656391
<SOS> `` i will tell you all about it , '' replied mousqueton . <EOS>	83.47300034480173
<SOS> porthos uttered a deep groan . <EOS>	83.2708698216554
<SOS> `` make way for us , planchet , '' said d'artagnan in a whisper to him , `` or he will not arrive alive ; the lungs are attacked , my friend . '' <EOS>	80.5702021521142
<SOS> planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says , `` in that case things look ill. '' then he exclaimed , turning to his men : `` let them pass ; they are friends . '' <EOS>	57.283358363801554
<SOS> the carriage resumed its course , and mazarin , who had held his breath , ventured to breathe again . <EOS>	102.52703996801529
<SOS> `` bricconi ! '' <EOS>	75.49081061950841
<SOS> muttered he . <EOS>	57.497190728290235
<SOS> a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop ; this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows , who resembled bandits more than anything else ; they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache . <EOS>	73.54416181943994
<SOS> `` attention , porthos ! '' <EOS>	85.51872354439244
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	40.15290627416454
<SOS> porthos placed his hand on the pistols . <EOS>	80.66127877906526
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	87.91483576742931
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	56.19563986293185
<SOS> `` my lord , i think we are in bad company . '' <EOS>	69.2249013587174
<SOS> a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand . <EOS>	56.80241612107264
<SOS> `` qui vive ? '' <EOS>	87.77006276797164
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	78.03744498611553
<SOS> `` eh , rascal ! '' <EOS>	49.01915186106122
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` do you not recognize his highness the prince 's carriage ? '' <EOS>	100.75425884849969
<SOS> `` prince or not , '' said the man , `` open . <EOS>	59.945484056279724

<SOS> `` what is to be done ? '' <EOS>	83.32750760694746
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	68.12625511978429
<SOS> `` pardieu ! <EOS>	101.81964803719642
<SOS> pass , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	63.8955937463381
<SOS> `` but how ? '' <EOS>	71.53432076034701
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	59.11327754889463
<SOS> `` through or over ; coachman , gallop on . '' <EOS>	82.68855177595567
<SOS> the coachman raised his whip . <EOS>	52.2281150301063
<SOS> `` not a step further , '' said the man , who appeared to be the captain , `` or i will hamstring your horses . '' <EOS>	73.38593401606434
<SOS> `` peste ! '' <EOS>	70.5646338308981
<SOS> said porthos , `` it would be a pity ; animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each . '' <EOS>	96.64113322762631
<SOS> `` i will pay you two hundred for them , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	100.24215973526589
<SOS> `` yes , but when once they are hamstrung , our necks will be strung next . '' <EOS>	72.47477906783145
<SOS> `` if one of them comes to my side , '' asked porthos , `` must i kill him ? '' <EOS>	101.274108443509
<SOS> `` yes , by a blow of your fist , if you can ; we will not fire but at the last extremity . '' <EOS>	41.760158182305666
<SOS> `` i can do it , '' said porthos . <EOS>	61.15341147878712
<SOS> `` come and open , then ! '' <EOS>	68.88396838518402
<SOS> cried d'artagnan to the man with the scythe , taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle . <EOS>	69.92638168772592
<SOS> and as the man approached , d'artagnan , in order to have more freedom for his actions , leaned half out of the door ; his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant , which were lighted up by a lantern . <EOS>	61.50719843719263
<SOS> without doubt he recognized d'artagnan , for he became deadly pale ; doubtless the musketeer knew him , for his hair stood up on his head . <EOS>	78.26781795371174
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	119.54634928472667
<SOS> he cried , falling back a step ; `` it is monsieur d'artagnan ! <EOS>	53.7893921309599
<SOS> let him pass . '' <EOS>	58.95106069268169
<SOS> d'artagnan was perhaps about to reply , when a blow , similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox , was heard . <EOS>	51.21129730238902
<SOS> the noise was caused by porthos , who had just knocked down his man . <EOS>	58.35714439511549
<SOS> d'artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off . <EOS>	78.52638532517587
<SOS> `` 'sdeath ! '' <EOS>	95.0606677438985
<SOS> cried he to the coachman . <EOS>	62.19713186213278
<SOS> `` spur your horses ! <EOS>	63.63237879109571
<SOS> whip ! <EOS>	106.2961353402725
<SOS> get on ! '' <EOS>	76.84994032856135
<SOS> the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses ; the noble animals bounded forward ; then cries of men who were knocked down were heard ; then a double concussion was felt , and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body . <EOS>	83.19067113872914
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence , then the carriage cleared the gate . <EOS>	62.053403433588585
<SOS> `` to cours la reine ! '' <EOS>	83.72403878755159
<SOS> cried d'artagnan to the coachman ; then turning to mazarin he said , `` now , my lord , you can say five paters and five aves , in thanks to heaven for your deliverance . <EOS>	66.40866956186592
<SOS> you are safe you are free . '' <EOS>	76.4942305689463
<SOS> mazarin replied only by a groan ; he could not believe in such a miracle . <EOS>	72.83893740209209
<SOS> five minutes later the carriage stopped , having reached cours la reine . <EOS>	106.78758081210523
<SOS> `` is my lord pleased with his escort ? '' <EOS>	92.51001461414994
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	66.01651024196259
<SOS> `` enchanted , monsieur , '' said mazarin , venturing his head out of one of the windows ; `` and now do as much for the queen . '' <EOS>	71.89539090600164
<SOS> `` it will not be so difficult , '' replied d'artagnan , springing to the ground . <EOS>	60.369178226984374
<SOS> `` monsieur du vallon , i commend his eminence to your care . '' <EOS>	52.01438989038649
<SOS> `` be quite at ease , '' said porthos , holding out his hand , which d'artagnan took and shook in his . <EOS>	87.83356569209289
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	74.0856070225129
<SOS> cried porthos , as if in pain . <EOS>	86.43328696024203
<SOS> d'artagnan looked with surprise at his friend . <EOS>	77.67879413010775
<SOS> `` what is the matter , then ? '' <EOS>	88.04720005600714
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	47.7576194727209
<SOS> `` i think i have sprained my wrist , ' said porthos . <EOS>	104.22028019367062
<SOS> `` the devil ! <EOS>	69.42928523039312
<SOS> why , you strike like a blind or a deaf man . '' <EOS>	51.42322207231538
<SOS> `` it was necessary ; my man was going to fire a pistol at me ; but you how did you get rid of yours ? '' <EOS>	69.38502497815008
<SOS> `` oh , mine , '' replied d'artagnan , `` was not a man . '' <EOS>	75.72618907522657
<SOS> `` what was it then ? '' <EOS>	110.91516407866405
<SOS> `` it was an apparition . '' <EOS>	105.7907412443331
<SOS> `` and `` `` i charmed it away . '' <EOS>	87.71377731946681
<SOS> without further explanation d'artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat , placed them in his belt , wrapped himself in his cloak , and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left , he took his way toward the richelieu gate . <EOS>	64.62351086409181
<SOS> chapter lii . <EOS>	80.41782344677195
<SOS> the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur . <EOS>	71.43670896107878
<SOS> instead of returning , then , by the saint honore gate , d'artagnan , who had time before him , walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu . <EOS>	81.57047110974268
<SOS> he was approached to be examined , and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat , that he was an officer of the musketeers , he was surrounded , with the intention of making him cry , `` down with mazarin ! '' <EOS>	59.02710125518281
<SOS> the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first ; but when he discovered what it meant , he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied . <EOS>	47.74842375703153
<SOS> he walked down the rue richelieu , meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn , for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of , when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee . <EOS>	95.46535756102831
<SOS> he was struck by a sudden idea . <EOS>	65.82370544066501
<SOS> `` ah , pardieu ! '' <EOS>	94.77714724365418
<SOS> he exclaimed ; `` that would be fair play . '' <EOS>	56.535943810031526
<SOS> and approaching the carriage , he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box . <EOS>	75.74219502434961
<SOS> this scrutiny was so much the more easy , the coachman being sound asleep . <EOS>	64.2258340654823
<SOS> `` it is , in truth , monsieur le coadjuteur 's carriage , '' said d'artagnan ; `` upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us . '' <EOS>	52.00859120757824
<SOS> he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman 's little finger . <EOS>	65.08971154905421
<SOS> `` to the palais royal , '' he called out . <EOS>	63.01390483284776
<SOS> the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired , never doubting but that the order had come from his master . <EOS>	98.34593493774206
<SOS> the porter at the palace was about to close the gates , but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch . <EOS>	94.44060228491904
<SOS> it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle ; he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back , and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door . <EOS>	57.67792744778974
<SOS> d'artagnan , in his turn , sprang to the ground , and just at the moment when the coachman , alarmed at not seeing his master , fell back a step , he seized him by his collar with the left , whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast . <EOS>	85.15398925786832
<SOS> `` pronounce one single word , '' muttered d'artagnan , `` and you are a dead man . '' <EOS>	81.38855595873558
<SOS> the coachman perceived at once , by the expression of the man who thus addressed him , that he had fallen into a trap , and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring . <EOS>	58.76784844515613
<SOS> two musketeers were pacing the court , to whom d'artagnan called by their names . <EOS>	67.06418314489845
<SOS> `` monsieur de belliere , '' said he to one of them , `` do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man , mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair , and wait for me there ; it is an affair of importance on the service of the king . '' <EOS>	95.20280292804762
<SOS> the musketeer , who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service , obeyed without a word , although he thought the order strange . <EOS>	52.005785610796366
<SOS> then turning toward the second musketeer , d'artagnan said : `` monsieur du verger , help me to place this man in a place of safety . '' <EOS>	78.43523028313801
<SOS> the musketeer , thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise , bowed , and drawing his sword , signified that he was ready . <EOS>	53.011099019617106
<SOS> d'artagnan mounted the staircase , followed by his prisoner , who in his turn was followed by the soldier , and entered mazarin 's ante room . <EOS>	70.90480020462299
<SOS> bernouin was waiting there , impatient for news of his master . <EOS>	74.36603809974149
<SOS> `` well , sir ? '' <EOS>	90.78564809043353
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	44.452492845597085
<SOS> `` everything goes on capitally , my dear monsieur bernouin , but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place . '' <EOS>	84.0567019130869
<SOS> `` where , then , sir ? '' <EOS>	71.14176631010444
<SOS> `` where you like , provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked . '' <EOS>	83.71204653778149
<SOS> `` we have that , sir , '' replied bernouin ; and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet , the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison . <EOS>	60.60238677728127
<SOS> `` and now , my good friend , '' said d'artagnan to him , `` i must invite you to deprive yourself , for my sake , of your hat and cloak . '' <EOS>	79.70671973607107
<SOS> the coachman , as we can well understand , made no resistance ; in fact , he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man ; d'artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets . <EOS>	68.1720057664128
<SOS> `` and now , monsieur du verger , '' he said , `` shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the door . <EOS>	72.49653514762947
<SOS> the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing , i know ; but , '' added he , seriously , `` you understand , it is on the king 's service . '' <EOS>	77.92406919303679
<SOS> `` at your command , lieutenant , '' replied the musketeer , who saw the business was a serious one . <EOS>	57.86319404753513
<SOS> `` by the bye , '' continued d'artagnan , `` should this man attempt to fly or to call out , pass your sword through his body . '' <EOS>	75.72636089399403
<SOS> the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter , and d'artagnan went out , followed by bernouin . <EOS>	67.43358245019583
<SOS> midnight struck . <EOS>	74.7047089475093
<SOS> `` lead me into the queen 's oratory , '' said d'artagnan , `` announce to her i am here , and put this parcel , with a well loaded musket , under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair . '' <EOS>	66.78226792964371
<SOS> bernouin conducted d'artagnan to the oratory , where he sat down pensively . <EOS>	49.35854899818119
<SOS> everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal . <EOS>	64.72932268511585
<SOS> as we said before , by ten o'clock almost all the guests had dispersed ; those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o'clock to one at cours la reine . <EOS>	68.77845093786092
<SOS> at ten o'clock anne of austria had entered the king 's room . <EOS>	71.24883235660458
<SOS> monsieur had just retired , and the youthful louis , remaining the last , was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle , a game which delighted him much . <EOS>	90.33938719655991
<SOS> two royal pages were playing with him . <EOS>	65.01119771635621
<SOS> `` laporte , '' said the queen , `` it is time for his majesty to go to bed . '' <EOS>	49.78245351544781
<SOS> the king asked to remain up , having , he said , no wish to sleep ; but the queen was firm . <EOS>	62.458281684666815
<SOS> `` are you not going to morrow morning at six o'clock , louis , to bathe at conflans ? <EOS>	56.47160657470668
<SOS> i think you wished to do so of your own accord ? '' <EOS>	58.26447937194303
<SOS> `` you are right , madame , '' said the king , `` and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me . <EOS>	72.51156223475463
<SOS> laporte , give the light to monsieur the chevalier de coislin . '' <EOS>	106.63493180567387
<SOS> the queen touched with her lips the white , smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette . <EOS>	96.4907070568393
<SOS> `` go to sleep soon , louis , '' said the queen , `` for you must be awakened very early . '' <EOS>	75.34375353767624
<SOS> `` i will do my best to obey you , madame , '' said the youthful king , `` but i have no inclination to sleep . '' <EOS>	97.53718258731094
<SOS> `` laporte , '' said anne of austria , in an undertone , `` find some very dull book to read to his majesty , but do not undress yourself . '' <EOS>	103.35048728610815
<SOS> the king went out , accompanied by the chevalier de coislin , bearing the candlestick , and then the queen returned to her own apartment . <EOS>	81.03218114731696
<SOS> her ladies that is to say madame de bregy , mademoiselle de beaumont , madame de motteville , and socratine , her sister , so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner , on which , according to her usual custom , she supped . <EOS>	53.78900353523629
<SOS> the queen then gave her orders , spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow , indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it , announced another visit on the following day to val de grace , where she intended to pay her devotions , and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her . <EOS>	64.59684855242496
<SOS> when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom . <EOS>	63.20993493197048
<SOS> madame de motteville , who was on especial duty that evening , followed to aid and undress her . <EOS>	101.23309907687077
<SOS> the queen then began to read , and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes , dismissed her . <EOS>	76.65967252811714
<SOS> it was at this moment d'artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace , in the coadjutor 's carriage , and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them . <EOS>	83.61906372190589
<SOS> a few minutes after twelve o'clock bernouin knocked at the queen 's bedroom door , having come by the cardinal 's secret corridor . <EOS>	70.69270458349654
<SOS> anne of austria opened the door to him herself . <EOS>	91.76997733987207
<SOS> she was dressed , that is to say , in dishabille , wrapped in a long , warm dressing gown . <EOS>	86.42854883972502
<SOS> `` it is you , bernouin , '' she said . <EOS>	77.4341896852628
<SOS> `` is monsieur d'artagnan there ? '' <EOS>	51.6736555854523
<SOS> `` yes , madame , in your oratory . <EOS>	62.86245353089262
<SOS> he is waiting till your majesty is ready . '' <EOS>	55.14987619656823
<SOS> `` i am . <EOS>	90.56579245196764
<SOS> go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king , and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me . '' <EOS>	65.16430070539964
<SOS> bernouin bowed and retired . <EOS>	61.39744111971886
<SOS> the queen entered her oratory , which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal , she saw d'artagnan , who stood expecting her . <EOS>	96.19513348042324
<SOS> `` is it you ? '' <EOS>	59.33215439032042
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	63.28040108552015
<SOS> `` yes , madame . '' <EOS>	76.60460594082774
<SOS> `` are you ready ? '' <EOS>	87.63896167872683
<SOS> `` i am . '' <EOS>	86.43694954184873
<SOS> `` and his eminence , the cardinal ? '' <EOS>	62.55386544047248
<SOS> `` has got off without any accident . <EOS>	52.56913477978718
<SOS> he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine . '' <EOS>	84.46683291118991
<SOS> `` but in what carriage do we start ? '' <EOS>	81.9966191556995
<SOS> `` i have provided for everything ; a carriage below is waiting for your majesty . '' <EOS>	58.409039570034935
<SOS> `` let us go to the king . '' <EOS>	42.34207169260306
<SOS> d'artagnan bowed and followed the queen . <EOS>	41.987537565034316
<SOS> the young louis was already dressed , with the exception of his shoes and doublet ; he had allowed himself to be dressed , in great astonishment , overwhelming laporte with questions , who replied only in these words , `` sire , it is by the queen 's commands . '' <EOS>	94.81343595485812
<SOS> the bedclothes were thrown back , exposing the king 's bed linen , which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen . <EOS>	51.96631750107602
<SOS> it was one of the results of mazarin 's niggardliness . <EOS>	80.68794234324626
<SOS> the queen entered and d'artagnan remained at the door . <EOS>	59.5546248472605
<SOS> as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her . <EOS>	81.46010654239711
<SOS> anne then motioned to d'artagnan to approach , and he obeyed . <EOS>	98.14053335368689
<SOS> `` my son , '' said anne of austria , pointing to the musketeer , calm , standing uncovered , `` here is monsieur d'artagnan , who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women . <EOS>	70.73201230795617
<SOS> remember his name well and look at him well , that his face may not be forgotten , for this evening he is going to render us a great service . '' <EOS>	61.44402530857903
<SOS> the young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye , and repeated : `` monsieur d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	90.53469835376848
<SOS> `` that is it , my son . '' <EOS>	105.27009078727701
<SOS> the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer ; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it . <EOS>	65.89717995493473
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' repeated louis ; `` very well , madame . '' <EOS>	64.85872301384187
<SOS> at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching . <EOS>	76.36862353894723
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	48.47466650417119
<SOS> exclaimed the queen . <EOS>	79.22280415262851
<SOS> `` oh , oh ! '' <EOS>	73.82564451765202
<SOS> replied d'artagnan , straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance , `` it is the murmur of the populace in revolution . '' <EOS>	74.6807844656699
<SOS> `` we must fly , '' said the queen . <EOS>	110.95443032583988
<SOS> `` your majesty has given me the control of this business ; we had better wait and see what they want . '' <EOS>	107.9013508725547
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	75.7279772491652
<SOS> `` i will answer for everything . '' <EOS>	56.36045182473862
<SOS> nothing is so catching as confidence . <EOS>	65.49956667362933
<SOS> the queen , full of energy and courage , was quickly alive to these two virtues in others . <EOS>	70.02383107769072
<SOS> `` do as you like , '' she said , `` i rely upon you . '' <EOS>	63.08536062306965
<SOS> `` will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business ? '' <EOS>	66.44899709243433
<SOS> `` command , sir . '' <EOS>	53.38382434153278
<SOS> `` what do the people want this time ? '' <EOS>	58.43590353659762
<SOS> demanded the king . <EOS>	75.13757712696642
<SOS> `` we are about to ascertain , sire , '' replied d'artagnan , as he rapidly left the room . <EOS>	107.49405646671956
<SOS> the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely . <EOS>	60.04113121706423
<SOS> cries were heard from the interior , of which they could not comprehend the sense . <EOS>	101.64647691413994
<SOS> it was evident that there was clamor and sedition . <EOS>	86.94258342995118
<SOS> the king , half dressed , the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place , where they were listening and waiting . <EOS>	78.70370310905855
<SOS> comminges , who was on guard that night at the palais royal , ran in . <EOS>	95.46416146858381
<SOS> he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables , and he placed them at the queen 's disposal . <EOS>	71.6143673703858
<SOS> `` well , '' asked anne of austria , when d'artagnan reappeared , `` what does it mean ? '' <EOS>	58.21384725033185
<SOS> `` it means , madame , that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal , carrying off the king , and the people ask to have proof to the contrary , or threaten to demolish the palais royal . '' <EOS>	75.80884816006498
<SOS> `` oh , this time it is too much ! '' <EOS>	78.27585509128231
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , `` and i will prove to them i have not left . '' <EOS>	70.60222020746525
<SOS> d'artagnan saw from the expression of the queen 's face that she was about to issue some violent command . <EOS>	65.11027807583305
<SOS> he approached her and said in a low voice : `` has your majesty still confidence in me ? '' <EOS>	87.03734070053446
<SOS> this voice startled her . <EOS>	80.87600567636488
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' she replied , `` every confidence ; speak . '' <EOS>	81.94558008087992
<SOS> `` will the queen deign to follow my advice ? '' <EOS>	79.96563246689459
<SOS> `` speak . '' <EOS>	65.98014971802849
<SOS> `` let your majesty dismiss m. de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables . '' <EOS>	65.84245585804882
<SOS> comminges glanced at d'artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up . <EOS>	82.89025378196199
<SOS> `` you hear , comminges ? '' <EOS>	68.30815441604355
<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	78.20769689889757
<SOS> d'artagnan went up to him ; with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance . <EOS>	74.27116666473205
<SOS> `` monsieur de comminges , '' he said , `` pardon me ; we both are servants of the queen , are we not ? <EOS>	103.41701121650635
<SOS> it is my turn to be of use to her ; do not envy me this happiness . '' <EOS>	64.24871388403177
<SOS> comminges bowed and left . <EOS>	76.40565259296368
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan to himself , `` i have got one more enemy . '' <EOS>	58.08077758746071
<SOS> `` and now , '' said the queen , addressing d'artagnan , `` what is to be done ? <EOS>	59.337989344460006
<SOS> for you hear that , instead of becoming calmer , the noise increases . '' <EOS>	104.2858737772771
<SOS> `` madame , '' said d'artagnan , `` the people want to see the king and they must see him . '' <EOS>	73.2839394736004
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	49.433683699993615
<SOS> must see him ! <EOS>	106.46020510662278
<SOS> where on the balcony ? '' <EOS>	74.43896668513663
<SOS> `` not at all , madame , but here , sleeping in his bed . '' <EOS>	62.75847584619143
<SOS> `` oh , your majesty , '' exclaimed laporte , `` monsieur d'artagnan is right . '' <EOS>	79.77212276237873
<SOS> the queen became thoughtful and smiled , like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger . <EOS>	74.59519662793484
<SOS> `` without doubt , '' she murmured . <EOS>	43.339992989802745
<SOS> `` monsieur laporte , '' said d'artagnan , `` go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king , but they shall see him in bed ; add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence , so as not to awaken him . '' <EOS>	80.4400138635538
<SOS> `` but not every one ; a deputation of two or four people . '' <EOS>	102.93192683737551
<SOS> `` every one , madame . '' <EOS>	89.20444804955574
<SOS> `` but reflect , they will keep us here till daybreak . '' <EOS>	103.81274039731649
<SOS> `` it shall take but a quarter of an hour , i answer for everything , madame ; believe me , i know the people ; they are like a great child , who only wants humoring . <EOS>	98.46226934319726
<SOS> before the sleeping king they will be mute , gentle and timid as lambs . '' <EOS>	97.29928831059868
<SOS> `` go , laporte , '' said the queen . <EOS>	93.52947664769607
<SOS> the young king approached his mother and said , `` why do as these people ask ? '' <EOS>	69.4274393172519
<SOS> `` it must be so , my son , '' said anne of austria . <EOS>	81.46407908992157
<SOS> `` but if they say , 'it must be ' to me , am i no longer king ? '' <EOS>	72.34238639332808
<SOS> the queen remained silent . <EOS>	93.58981406294288
<SOS> `` sire , '' said d'artagnan , `` will your majesty permit me to ask you a question ? '' <EOS>	66.02907462727967
<SOS> louis xiv . <EOS>	41.45703128176334
<SOS> turned around , astonished that any one should dare to address him . <EOS>	89.48692482314617
<SOS> but the queen pressed the child 's hand . <EOS>	63.61561494386344
<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	78.91955739232719
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	90.90621304862692
<SOS> `` does your majesty remember , when playing in the park of fontainebleau , or in the palace courts at versailles , ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder ? '' <EOS>	53.37203489144937
<SOS> `` yes , certainly . '' <EOS>	106.95510986407697
<SOS> `` well , then , this noise of thunder , however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing , has said , 'go in , sire . <EOS>	71.2925482080597
<SOS> you must do so . ' '' <EOS>	81.7558356442022
<SOS> `` certainly , sir ; but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god . '' <EOS>	71.03570644367409
<SOS> `` well then , sire , '' continued d'artagnan , `` listen to the noise of the people ; you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder . '' <EOS>	64.58526358773723
<SOS> in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze ; then all at once it ceased . <EOS>	51.22594475551674
<SOS> `` hold , sire , '' said d'artagnan , `` they have just told the people that you are asleep ; you see , you still are king . '' <EOS>	104.15968226242151
<SOS> the queen looked with surprise at this strange man , whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest , and who was , by his fine and quick intelligence , the equal of the most astute . <EOS>	63.328158965048615
<SOS> laporte entered . <EOS>	109.55293087291761
<SOS> `` well , laporte ? '' <EOS>	47.60033815646028
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	78.33094940407186
<SOS> `` madame , '' he replied , `` monsieur d'artagnan 's prediction has been accomplished ; they are calm , as if by enchantment . <EOS>	86.86453766638938
<SOS> the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here . '' <EOS>	48.62199339866348
<SOS> `` laporte , '' said the queen , `` suppose you put one of your sons in the king 's place ; we might be off during the time . '' <EOS>	70.8788535916839
<SOS> `` if your majesty desires it , '' said laporte , `` my sons , like myself , are at the queen 's service . '' <EOS>	69.43088448217824
<SOS> `` not at all , '' said d'artagnan ; `` should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute , all would be lost . '' <EOS>	111.89810311141501
<SOS> `` you are right , sir , always right , '' said anne of austria . <EOS>	78.80644703668305
<SOS> `` laporte , place the king in bed . '' <EOS>	68.86395689251336
<SOS> laporte placed the king , dressed as he was , in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet . <EOS>	71.16037080437648
<SOS> the queen bent over him and kissed his brow . <EOS>	78.41094440212228
<SOS> `` pretend to sleep , louis , '' said she . <EOS>	62.49126209291391
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the king , `` but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men . '' <EOS>	76.6905606347611
<SOS> `` sire , i am here , '' said d'artagnan , `` and i give you my word , that if a single man has the audacity , his life shall pay for it . '' <EOS>	101.95109695950013
<SOS> `` and now what is to be done ? '' <EOS>	72.27809835198681
<SOS> asked the queen , `` for i hear them . '' <EOS>	77.71420012266087
<SOS> `` monsieur laporte , go to them and again recommend silence . <EOS>	74.52303525258434
<SOS> madame , wait at the door , whilst i shall be at the head of the king 's bed , ready to die for him . '' <EOS>	69.85078074488688
<SOS> laporte went out ; the queen remained standing near the hangings , whilst d'artagnan glided behind the curtains . <EOS>	50.17058580263156
<SOS> then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard , and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips . <EOS>	49.22580376269295
<SOS> on seeing the queen , the men stopped short , respectfully . <EOS>	104.21555270707866
<SOS> `` enter , gentlemen , enter , '' said the queen . <EOS>	95.93167603589995
<SOS> there was then amongst that crowd a moment 's hesitation , which looked like shame . <EOS>	111.11143960709623
<SOS> they had expected resistance , they had expected to be thwarted , to have to force the gates , to overturn the guards . <EOS>	90.01469977226783
<SOS> the gates had opened of themselves , and the king , ostensibly at least , had no other guard at his bed head but his mother . <EOS>	71.29132985922475
<SOS> the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back . <EOS>	66.79774573309928
<SOS> `` enter , gentlemen , '' said laporte , `` since the queen desires you so to do . '' <EOS>	51.95167809173692
<SOS> then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe . <EOS>	107.3617501304373
<SOS> this example was imitated by the rest , until the room filled silently , as if these men had been the humblest , most devoted courtiers . <EOS>	75.65544056002302
<SOS> far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen , all craning to their utmost height to try and see . <EOS>	61.489754537553324
<SOS> d'artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain , and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet . <EOS>	67.7729296328789
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the queen to him , thinking he was the leader of the band , `` you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself . <EOS>	66.4741277586542
<SOS> approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away . '' <EOS>	75.89392327959663
<SOS> `` no , certainly , '' replied planchet , rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him . <EOS>	69.78933216416952
<SOS> `` you will say , then , to my good and faithful parisians , '' continued anne , with a smile , the expression of which did not deceive d'artagnan , `` that you have seen the king in bed , asleep , and the queen also ready to retire . '' <EOS>	93.86510338529905
<SOS> `` i shall tell them , madame , and those who accompany me will say the same thing ; but `` `` but what ? '' <EOS>	116.8048680966963
<SOS> asked anne of austria . <EOS>	83.53528050843882
<SOS> `` will your majesty pardon me , '' said planchet , `` but is it really the king who is lying there ? '' <EOS>	93.2369311877475
<SOS> anne of austria started . <EOS>	95.22310959559056
<SOS> `` if , '' she said , `` there is one among you who knows the king , let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there . '' <EOS>	53.62737158757312
<SOS> a man wrapped in a cloak , in the folds of which his face was hidden , approached and leaned over the bed and looked . <EOS>	88.56598454808939
<SOS> for one second , d'artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword ; but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d'artagnan recognized the coadjutor . <EOS>	58.2514460024528
<SOS> `` it is certainly the king , '' said the man , rising again . <EOS>	62.00271578690966
<SOS> `` god bless his majesty ! '' <EOS>	74.90823376831614
<SOS> `` yes , '' repeated the leader in a whisper , `` god bless his majesty ! '' <EOS>	70.16694553369929
<SOS> and all these men , who had entered enraged , passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn . <EOS>	56.445673733544915
<SOS> `` now , '' said planchet , `` let us thank the queen . <EOS>	65.89504415557329
<SOS> my friends , retire . '' <EOS>	62.73932394854436
<SOS> they all bowed , and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered . <EOS>	78.36109177294637
<SOS> planchet , who had been the first to enter , was the last to leave . <EOS>	49.4525119779443
<SOS> the queen stopped him . <EOS>	55.46415185386738
<SOS> `` what is your name , my friend ? '' <EOS>	82.77720777128627
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	46.62408841082179
<SOS> planchet , much surprised at the inquiry , turned back . <EOS>	77.9070391433029
<SOS> `` yes , '' continued the queen , `` i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince , and i wish to know your name . '' <EOS>	83.2989313792148
<SOS> `` yes , '' thought planchet , `` to treat me as a prince . <EOS>	56.597446024749786
<SOS> no , thank you . '' <EOS>	46.54212708469317
<SOS> d'artagnan trembled lest planchet , seduced , like the crow in the fable , should tell his name , and that the queen , knowing his name , would discover that planchet had belonged to him . <EOS>	67.4024776497367
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied planchet , respectfully , `` i am called dulaurier , at your service . '' <EOS>	51.51281785225886
<SOS> `` thank you , monsieur dulaurier , '' said the queen ; `` and what is your business ? '' <EOS>	56.19353240727549
<SOS> `` madame , i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais . '' <EOS>	59.492755851570166
<SOS> `` that is all i wished to know , '' said the queen . <EOS>	53.14905612027035
<SOS> `` much obliged to you , monsieur dulaurier . <EOS>	46.760933634457366
<SOS> you will hear again from me . '' <EOS>	52.86480725453101
<SOS> `` come , come , '' thought d'artagnan , emerging from behind the curtain , `` decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool ; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school . '' <EOS>	64.24191322609356
<SOS> the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another , without uttering a single word ; the queen standing near the door , d'artagnan half out of his hiding place , the king raised on his elbow , ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude , but instead of approaching , the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away . <EOS>	74.8449960597385
<SOS> the queen breathed more freely . <EOS>	74.15850682218259
<SOS> d'artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed , saying , `` let us go . '' <EOS>	90.90999453309395
<SOS> at this moment laporte reappeared . <EOS>	67.08563317735468
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	62.88139908173136
<SOS> asked the queen `` well , madame , '' replied the valet , `` i followed them as far as the gates . <EOS>	49.1425489264134
<SOS> they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them ; and , in fact , they went away quite proud and happy . '' <EOS>	92.18907607041344
<SOS> `` oh , the miserable wretches ! '' <EOS>	105.38693272346971
<SOS> murmured the queen , `` they shall pay dearly for their boldness , and it is i who promise this . '' <EOS>	53.67143067541114
<SOS> then turning to d'artagnan , she said : `` sir , you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received . <EOS>	113.63072356930103
<SOS> continue , and say what we must do now . '' <EOS>	97.99831054255472
<SOS> `` monsieur laporte , '' said d'artagnan , `` finish dressing his majesty . '' <EOS>	109.85654482433024
<SOS> `` we may go , then ? '' <EOS>	105.4532378176479
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	71.21827734656974
<SOS> `` whenever your majesty pleases . <EOS>	104.33681310710101
<SOS> you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door . '' <EOS>	54.153435168495356
<SOS> `` go , sir , '' said the queen ; `` i will follow you . '' <EOS>	54.049451645640374
<SOS> d'artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box . <EOS>	59.215446933703305
<SOS> d'artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat . <EOS>	71.34203702560728
<SOS> it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy 's coachman . <EOS>	81.28044038405005
<SOS> he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head , whilst the musketeer got off the box . <EOS>	52.91271921245933
<SOS> `` sir , '' said d'artagnan , `` you will go and release your companion , who is guarding the coachman . <EOS>	84.21706322435789
<SOS> you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne , hotel de la chevrette , whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon , which you must saddle and equip as if for war , and then you will leave paris , bringing them with you to cours la reine . <EOS>	53.84587251533255
<SOS> if , when you arrive at cours la reine , you find no one , you must go on to saint germain . <EOS>	98.66880235206924
<SOS> on the king 's service . '' <EOS>	61.34461756794137
<SOS> the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received . <EOS>	60.210090970865515
<SOS> d'artagnan mounted the box , having a pair of pistols in his belt , a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him . <EOS>	115.35817662808422
<SOS> the queen appeared , and was followed by the king and the duke d'anjou , his brother . <EOS>	66.82530013668448
<SOS> `` monsieur the coadjutor 's carriage ! '' <EOS>	114.14531174948124
<SOS> she exclaimed , falling back . <EOS>	98.87891152525873
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' said d'artagnan ; `` but get in fearlessly , for i myself will drive you . '' <EOS>	80.8977966351532
<SOS> the queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage , and the king and monsieur took their places at her side . <EOS>	65.53497546864419
<SOS> `` come , laporte , '' said the queen . <EOS>	74.87905685798124
<SOS> `` how , madame ! '' <EOS>	71.65626414636674
<SOS> said the valet , `` in the same carriage as your majesties ? '' <EOS>	89.82101258146609
<SOS> `` it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening , but of the king 's safety . <EOS>	71.51356253015344
<SOS> get in , laporte . '' <EOS>	78.7060470683837
<SOS> laporte obeyed . <EOS>	47.28586782888563
<SOS> `` pull down the blinds , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	77.89568085219524
<SOS> `` but will that not excite suspicion , sir ? '' <EOS>	83.87289138542269
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	62.10636981510243
<SOS> `` your majesty 's mind may be quite at ease , '' replied the officer ; `` i have my answer ready . '' <EOS>	63.13514262546671
<SOS> the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu . <EOS>	61.61578196997148
<SOS> on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men , holding a lantern in his hand . <EOS>	86.3699940620692
<SOS> d'artagnan signed to them to draw near . <EOS>	63.38974081726775
<SOS> `` do you recognize the carriage ? '' <EOS>	97.32527739523164
<SOS> he asked the sergeant . <EOS>	59.97083337707488
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the latter . <EOS>	85.4769690775799
<SOS> `` look at the arms . '' <EOS>	95.69206841812758
<SOS> the sergeant put the lantern near the panel . <EOS>	121.07611750329639
<SOS> `` they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur , '' he said . <EOS>	106.53256679822063
<SOS> `` hush ; he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee . '' <EOS>	71.6815274619625
<SOS> the sergeant began to laugh . <EOS>	57.27449101247995
<SOS> `` open the gate , '' he cried . <EOS>	116.30280174842643
<SOS> `` i know who it is ! '' <EOS>	80.89663243546937
<SOS> then putting his face to the lowered blinds , he said : `` i wish you joy , my lord ! '' <EOS>	82.76497859690065
<SOS> `` impudent fellow ! '' <EOS>	59.282073363879846
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` you will get me turned off . '' <EOS>	79.78141569581123
<SOS> the gate groaned on its hinges , and d'artagnan , seeing the way clear , whipped his horses , who started at a canter , and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal . <EOS>	61.90594295407139
<SOS> `` mousqueton ! '' <EOS>	54.52766410824124
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , `` draw up the blinds of his majesty 's carriage . '' <EOS>	93.33262060955033
<SOS> `` it is he ! '' <EOS>	120.31006772621579
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	69.2789987241858
<SOS> `` disguised as a coachman ! '' <EOS>	116.8028185205339
<SOS> exclaimed mazarin . <EOS>	63.73543703374235
<SOS> `` and driving the coadjutor 's carriage ! '' <EOS>	50.35384292059383
<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	93.91273612729653
<SOS> `` corpo di dio ! <EOS>	88.46406976512925
<SOS> monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	77.38437842939013

<SOS> how d'artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw . <EOS>	50.42315010811162
<SOS> mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain , but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her . <EOS>	50.75174335133403
<SOS> however , she offered the cardinal laporte 's place , which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other . <EOS>	45.63746463507942
<SOS> it was not without foundation that a report of the king 's intention to leave paris by night had been circulated . <EOS>	96.50597887942175
<SOS> ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o'clock , and howsoever great their prudence might be , they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated . <EOS>	66.32026286987988
<SOS> besides , each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested ; and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance , every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire ; so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets . <EOS>	84.83796455005493
<SOS> the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé , with the princess and dowager princess . <EOS>	80.0603357309937
<SOS> both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about . <EOS>	79.75600344733236
<SOS> the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans , the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere ; and the third , the duke de longueville and the prince de conti , brother and brother in law of condé . <EOS>	56.135059730179016
<SOS> they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach . <EOS>	70.6252050664091
<SOS> the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left , and seeing that it was empty , she said : `` but where is madame de longueville ? '' <EOS>	61.867252483994804
<SOS> `` ah , yes , where is my sister ? '' <EOS>	49.66127203545208
<SOS> asked the prince . <EOS>	72.89579649127268
<SOS> `` madame de longueville is ill , '' said the duke , `` and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty . '' <EOS>	100.45663593433315
<SOS> anne gave a quick glance to mazarin , who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head . <EOS>	42.89594786387546
<SOS> `` what do you say of this ? '' <EOS>	99.36996843782153
<SOS> asked the queen . <EOS>	102.32708060282289
<SOS> `` i say that she is a hostage for the parisians , '' answered the cardinal . <EOS>	80.7969080776573
<SOS> `` why is she not come ? '' <EOS>	106.05918728925407
<SOS> asked the prince in a low voice , addressing his brother . <EOS>	72.99636589861599
<SOS> `` silence , '' whispered the duke , `` she has her reasons . '' <EOS>	74.53754493712582
<SOS> `` she will ruin us ! '' <EOS>	98.3072758829976
<SOS> returned the prince . <EOS>	87.29320902334652
<SOS> `` she will save us , '' said conti . <EOS>	65.69500966832858
<SOS> carriages now arrived in crowds ; those of the marechal de villeroy , guitant , villequier and comminges came into the line . <EOS>	45.64866531709682
<SOS> the two musketeers arrived in their turn , holding the horses of d'artagnan and porthos in their hands . <EOS>	70.08254037942447
<SOS> these two instantly mounted , the coachman of the latter replacing d'artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach . <EOS>	78.62900282191562
<SOS> mousqueton took the place of the coachman , and drove standing , for reasons known to himself , like automedon of antiquity . <EOS>	73.7147127085405
<SOS> the queen , though occupied by a thousand details , tried to catch the gascon 's eye ; but he , with his wonted prudence , had mingled with the crowd . <EOS>	69.2337010035357
<SOS> `` let us be the avant guard , '' said he to porthos , `` and find good quarters at saint germain ; nobody will think of us , and for my part i am greatly fatigued . '' <EOS>	80.52515335627294
<SOS> `` as for me , '' replied porthos , `` i am falling asleep , which is strange , considering we have not had any fighting ; truly the parisians are idiots . '' <EOS>	50.04534120769153
<SOS> `` or rather , we are very clever , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	78.11716603742249
<SOS> `` perhaps . '' <EOS>	62.91625533459838
<SOS> `` and how is your wrist ? '' <EOS>	62.68967506002622
<SOS> `` better ; but do you think that we 've got them this time ? '' <EOS>	53.93997420508243
<SOS> `` got what ? '' <EOS>	59.2532885529937
<SOS> `` you your command , and i my title ? '' <EOS>	108.62431932531527
<SOS> `` i'faith ! <EOS>	63.75576124493536
<SOS> yes i should expect so ; besides , if they forget , i shall take the liberty of reminding them . '' <EOS>	54.1310621905864
<SOS> `` the queen 's voice ! <EOS>	67.22769200743333
<SOS> she is speaking , '' said porthos ; `` i think she wants to ride on horseback . '' <EOS>	78.44465955798604
<SOS> `` oh , she would like it , but `` `` but what ? '' <EOS>	58.327316495739936
<SOS> `` the cardinal wo n't allow it . <EOS>	65.01216254270498
<SOS> gentlemen , '' he said , addressing the two musketeers , `` accompany the royal carriage , we are going forward to look for lodgings . '' <EOS>	65.42383446918329
<SOS> d'artagnan started off for saint germain , followed by porthos . <EOS>	91.25286204860507
<SOS> `` we will go on , gentlemen , '' said the queen . <EOS>	92.01944895004075
<SOS> and the royal carriage drove on , followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen . <EOS>	65.62368279804372
<SOS> they reached saint german without any accident ; on descending , the queen found the prince awaiting her , bare headed , to offer her his hand . <EOS>	71.91383752109522
<SOS> `` what an awakening for the parisians ! '' <EOS>	72.3491413319042
<SOS> said the queen , radiant . <EOS>	71.01564034840825
<SOS> `` it is war , '' said the prince . <EOS>	79.05583449625605
<SOS> `` well , then , let it be war ! <EOS>	95.27533307298917
<SOS> have we not on our side the conqueror of rocroy , of nordlingen , of lens ? '' <EOS>	56.80944877961931
<SOS> the prince bowed low . <EOS>	68.57102037650417
<SOS> it was then three o'clock in the morning . <EOS>	75.80220913143371
<SOS> the queen walked first , every one followed her . <EOS>	62.15804149792569
<SOS> about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight . <EOS>	87.11527747390379
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the queen , laughing , `` pray take up your abode in the chateau ; it is large , and there will be no want of room for you all ; but , as we never thought of coming here , i am informed that there are , in all , only three beds in the whole establishment , one for the king , one for me `` `` and one for the cardinal , '' muttered the prince . <EOS>	117.64132324147042
<SOS> `` am i am i , then , to sleep on the floor ? '' <EOS>	93.56816796300335
<SOS> asked gaston d'orleans , with a forced smile . <EOS>	71.26846843860835
<SOS> `` no , my prince , '' replied mazarin , `` the third bed is intended for your highness . '' <EOS>	60.31226700645384
<SOS> `` but your eminence ? '' <EOS>	99.62959828904988
<SOS> replied the prince . <EOS>	61.90822731151311
<SOS> `` i , '' answered mazarin , `` i shall not sleep at all ; i have work to do . '' <EOS>	39.75398758672673
<SOS> gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep , without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose . <EOS>	68.53486459496372
<SOS> `` well , for my part , i shall go to bed , '' said d'artagnan ; `` come , porthos . '' <EOS>	67.9941141256167
<SOS> porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend . <EOS>	59.60774875046704
<SOS> they walked from one end of the chateau to the other , porthos looking with wondering eyes at d'artagnan , who was counting on his fingers . <EOS>	54.786646833918816
<SOS> `` four hundred , at a pistole each , four hundred pistoles . '' <EOS>	87.00327987218067
<SOS> `` yes , '' interposed porthos , `` four hundred pistoles ; but who is to make four hundred pistoles ? '' <EOS>	42.12216599932422
<SOS> `` a pistole is not enough , '' said d'artagnan , `` 't is worth a louis . '' <EOS>	105.08897460443256
<SOS> `` what is worth a louis ? '' <EOS>	112.59514863365786
<SOS> `` four hundred , at a louis each , make four hundred louis . '' <EOS>	64.05948803887814
<SOS> `` four hundred ? '' <EOS>	75.43055755854144
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	66.13076382855037
<SOS> `` yes , there are two hundred of them , and each of them will need two , which will make four hundred . '' <EOS>	57.90857077469106
<SOS> `` but four hundred what ? '' <EOS>	55.066945930020395
<SOS> `` listen ! '' <EOS>	78.6252226630569
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	91.47710722932423
<SOS> but as there were all kinds of people about , who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court , he whispered in his friend 's ear . <EOS>	52.8782239806414
<SOS> `` i understand , '' answered porthos , `` i understand you perfectly , on my honor ; two hundred louis , each of us , would be making a pretty thing of it ; but what will people say ? '' <EOS>	62.21229368358096
<SOS> `` let them say what they will ; besides , how will they know that we are doing it ? '' <EOS>	106.62635437285867
<SOS> `` but who will distribute these things ? '' <EOS>	86.4727366388041
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	54.480586910136154
<SOS> `` is n't mousqueton there ? '' <EOS>	115.33229284702077
<SOS> `` but he wears my livery ; my livery will be known , '' replied porthos . <EOS>	73.26582625359634
<SOS> `` he can turn his coat inside out . '' <EOS>	59.92902399552691
<SOS> `` you are always in the right , my dear friend , '' cried porthos ; `` but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice ? '' <EOS>	66.52611971939098
<SOS> d'artagnan smiled . <EOS>	73.65822969541104
<SOS> the two friends turned down the first street they came to . <EOS>	84.32827732924224
<SOS> porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right , whilst d'artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left . <EOS>	71.27100770724302
<SOS> `` some straw , '' they said . <EOS>	75.63471145266449
<SOS> `` sir , we do n't keep any , '' was the reply of the people who opened the doors ; `` but please ask at the hay dealer 's . '' <EOS>	99.64646423553876
<SOS> `` where is the hay dealer 's ? '' <EOS>	67.56462628292527
<SOS> `` at the last large door in the street . '' <EOS>	77.43798197052787
<SOS> `` are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw ? '' <EOS>	55.27230423223099
<SOS> `` yes ; there 's the landlord of the lamb , and gros louis the farmer ; they both live in the rue des ursulines . '' <EOS>	66.36777141857321
<SOS> `` very well . '' <EOS>	42.94157660992042
<SOS> d'artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw , which he obtained , at the rate of three pistoles each . <EOS>	69.94313819548019
<SOS> he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price . <EOS>	65.70981923670242
<SOS> finally , farmer louis sold them eighty trusses , making in all four hundred and thirty . <EOS>	74.33768798297189
<SOS> there was no more to be had in saint germain . <EOS>	67.23613191366707
<SOS> this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour . <EOS>	48.85635077364161
<SOS> mousqueton , duly instructed , was put at the head of this sudden and new business . <EOS>	84.52235906553523
<SOS> he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss , and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis . <EOS>	65.84998199168678
<SOS> d'artagnan , taking with him three trusses of straw , returned to the chateau , where everybody , freezing with cold and more than half asleep , envied the king , the queen , and the duke of orleans , on their camp beds . <EOS>	81.35032764132747
<SOS> the lieutenant 's entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room ; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention , but began to arrange , with so much cleverness , nicety and gayety , his straw bed , that the mouths of all these poor creatures , who could not go to sleep , began to water . <EOS>	78.80963106150777
<SOS> `` straw ! '' <EOS>	76.10556890615831
<SOS> they all cried out , `` straw ! <EOS>	87.26394867927425
<SOS> where is there any to be found ? '' <EOS>	74.7304375285635
<SOS> `` i can show you , '' answered the gascon . <EOS>	73.03685004814855
<SOS> and he conducted them to mousqueton , who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece . <EOS>	75.65781139816973
<SOS> it was thought rather dear , but people wanted to sleep , and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep ? <EOS>	66.48788002321984
<SOS> d'artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it , making it over about a dozen times ; and since he was supposed to have paid , like the others , a louis for his truss of straw , he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour . <EOS>	120.45948773490413
<SOS> at five o'clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had . <EOS>	113.88254130438226
<SOS> d'artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use . <EOS>	48.485379365691585
<SOS> he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them , and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton , who , naively , and like the worthy steward that he was , handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself . <EOS>	52.87104465586481
<SOS> mousqueton , who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau , wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner . <EOS>	83.40083588735122
<SOS> d'artagnan put the gold in his hat , and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos , each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis . <EOS>	59.73962445090685
<SOS> porthos , however , found that he had no straw left for himself . <EOS>	83.62417008122824
<SOS> he returned to mousqueton , but the steward had sold the last wisp . <EOS>	108.30978661866043
<SOS> he then repaired to d'artagnan , who , thanks to his four trusses of straw , was in the act of making up and tasting , by anticipation , the luxury of a bed so soft , so well stuffed at the head , so well covered at the foot , that it would have excited the envy of the king himself , if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own . <EOS>	99.41711083214926
<SOS> d'artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for porthos , but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it , he consented that porthos should share his couch with him . <EOS>	80.73292641021798
<SOS> he laid his sword at the head , his pistols by his side , stretched his cloak over his feet , placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw , which rustled under him . <EOS>	103.13532523275649
<SOS> he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis , made in a quarter of an hour , when a voice was heard at the door of the hall , which made him stir . <EOS>	58.49261939494099
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	50.87089760348292
<SOS> it cried . <EOS>	81.98204211216007
<SOS> `` here ! '' <EOS>	56.09432077370184
<SOS> cried porthos , `` here ! '' <EOS>	79.40459767513839
<SOS> porthos foresaw that if d'artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed . <EOS>	62.72912279173161
<SOS> an officer approached . <EOS>	81.14022572401393
<SOS> `` i am come to fetch you , monsieur d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	87.91212583603193
<SOS> `` from whom ? '' <EOS>	51.55596463959822
<SOS> `` his eminence sent me . '' <EOS>	55.91020578165764
<SOS> `` tell my lord that i 'm going to sleep , and i advise him , as a friend , to do the same . '' <EOS>	42.42180300368982
<SOS> `` his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed , and wants you instantly . '' <EOS>	47.83731445925318
<SOS> `` the devil take mazarin , who does not know when to sleep at the proper time . <EOS>	90.0872321399018
<SOS> what does he want with me ? <EOS>	98.12040806247187
<SOS> is it to make me a captain ? <EOS>	77.33438222369168
<SOS> in that case i will forgive him . '' <EOS>	88.7644478056922
<SOS> and the musketeer rose , grumbling , took his sword , hat , pistols , and cloak , and followed the officer , whilst porthos , alone and sole possessor of the bed , endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep , which his predecessor had set him . <EOS>	91.44150714820418
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' said the cardinal , on perceiving him , `` i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me . <EOS>	64.43862864360418
<SOS> i am going to prove to you that i have not . '' <EOS>	94.99670609559736
<SOS> `` good , '' thought the gascon , `` this is a promising beginning . '' <EOS>	66.30322771473374
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan , '' he resumed , `` do you wish to become a captain ? '' <EOS>	83.50172707135268
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	84.71927466692236
<SOS> `` and your friend still longs to be made a baron ? '' <EOS>	47.84806519317592
<SOS> `` at this very moment , my lord , he no doubt dreams that he is one already . '' <EOS>	94.51365932732408
<SOS> `` then , '' said mazarin , taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown d'artagnan , `` take this dispatch and carry it to england . '' <EOS>	78.49318700321929
<SOS> d'artagnan looked at the envelope ; there was no address on it . <EOS>	68.53522992847897
<SOS> `` am i not to know to whom to present it ? '' <EOS>	71.8616812318535
<SOS> `` you will know when you reach london ; at london you may tear off the outer envelope . '' <EOS>	110.95263940683279
<SOS> `` and what are my instructions ? '' <EOS>	72.05687369528157
<SOS> `` to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed . <EOS>	83.56117071627294
<SOS> you must set out for boulogne . <EOS>	87.56014314246076
<SOS> at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt . '' <EOS>	60.92276845651533
<SOS> `` yes , my lord ; and what am i to do with this young gentleman ? '' <EOS>	63.38735424121562
<SOS> `` follow wherever he leads you . '' <EOS>	59.027114196128885
<SOS> d'artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air . <EOS>	97.80546655021845
<SOS> `` there are your instructions , '' said mazarin ; `` go ! '' <EOS>	82.56922810470941
<SOS> `` go ! <EOS>	91.07049762822724

<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	84.4832082732384
<SOS> replied mazarin , `` so you have no money ? '' <EOS>	72.75025860539866
<SOS> `` none , my lord . '' <EOS>	80.1545542592359
<SOS> `` but the diamond i gave you yesterday ? '' <EOS>	104.21873725665804
<SOS> `` i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence . '' <EOS>	60.72424527153104
<SOS> mazarin sighed . <EOS>	85.68776418930481
<SOS> `` 't is very dear living in england , my lord , especially as envoy extraordinary . '' <EOS>	93.45483383347037
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	92.20425028166814
<SOS> replied mazarin , `` the people there are very sedate , and their habits , since the revolution , simple ; but no matter . '' <EOS>	74.66971431773275
<SOS> he opened a drawer and took out a purse . <EOS>	63.758846460849306
<SOS> `` what do you say to a thousand crowns ? '' <EOS>	95.39205116868433
<SOS> d'artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner . <EOS>	98.72079344095697
<SOS> `` i reply , my lord , 't is but little , as certainly i shall not go alone . '' <EOS>	67.46636845744348
<SOS> `` i suppose not . <EOS>	119.11973088773034
<SOS> monsieur du vallon , that worthy gentleman , for , with the exception of yourself , monsieur d'artagnan , there 's not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him `` `` then , my lord , '' replied d'artagnan , pointing to the purse which mazarin still held , `` if you love and esteem him so much , you understand me ? '' <EOS>	58.728465733125
<SOS> `` be it so ! <EOS>	59.91530037294158
<SOS> on his account i add two hundred crowns . '' <EOS>	92.77058703293562
<SOS> `` scoundrel ! '' <EOS>	71.93914841944708
<SOS> muttered d'artagnan . <EOS>	90.22288308471828
<SOS> `` but on our return , '' he said aloud , `` may we , that is , my friend and i , depend on having , he his barony , and i my promotion ? '' <EOS>	75.1286716710768
<SOS> `` on the honor of mazarin . '' <EOS>	101.9930577325738
<SOS> `` i should like another sort of oath better , '' said d'artagnan to himself ; then aloud , `` may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen ? '' <EOS>	55.91026127457015
<SOS> `` her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly , '' replied mazarin ; `` go , pray , sir `` `` one word more , my lord ; if there 's any fighting where i 'm going , must i fight ? '' <EOS>	59.00847461367499
<SOS> `` you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter . '' <EOS>	116.34379345060118
<SOS> `` 't is well , '' said d'artagnan , holding out his hand to receive the money . <EOS>	91.2553770244886
<SOS> `` i offer my best respects and services to you , my lord . '' <EOS>	63.17703159896428
<SOS> d'artagnan then , returning to the officer , said : `` sir , have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say 't is by his eminence 's order , and that i shall await him at the stables . '' <EOS>	68.07556649123981
<SOS> the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter . <EOS>	92.7566292965296
<SOS> porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder . <EOS>	48.331816716024484
<SOS> `` i come from the cardinal , '' said the officer . <EOS>	66.70233542649913
<SOS> `` heigho ! '' <EOS>	101.87168134014692
<SOS> said porthos , opening his large eyes ; `` what have you got to say ? '' <EOS>	91.45356042073671
<SOS> `` that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur d'artagnan is waiting for you in the stables . '' <EOS>	78.28968464018219
<SOS> porthos sighed heavily , arose , took his hat , his pistols , and his cloak , and departed , casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well . <EOS>	53.73678532546217
<SOS> no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it , and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor , in his turn , was snoring immoderately . <EOS>	95.6583925100677
<SOS> it was very natural , he being the only person in the whole assemblage , except the king , the queen , and the duke of orleans , who slept gratuitously . <EOS>	97.15295732140834
<SOS> chapter liv . <EOS>	107.8255770062058
<SOS> in which we hear tidings of aramis . <EOS>	53.10914836045019
<SOS> d'artagnan went straight to the stables ; day was just dawning . <EOS>	53.76224320022979
<SOS> he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger , but to an empty manger . <EOS>	86.3381293630985
<SOS> he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable , where he saw a little straw , but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body , which uttered a cry and arose on its knees , rubbing its eyes . <EOS>	54.90283365223067
<SOS> it was mousqueton , who , having no straw to lie upon , had helped himself to that of the horses . <EOS>	69.13653396923097
<SOS> `` mousqueton , '' cried d'artagnan , `` let us be off ! <EOS>	109.17481774190169
<SOS> let us set off . '' <EOS>	76.47422704382066
<SOS> mousqueton , recognizing the voice of his master 's friend , got up suddenly , and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night . <EOS>	91.18242015046526
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	94.27756991357886
<SOS> ho ! '' <EOS>	64.26250622424105
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , picking up a louis and displaying it ; `` here 's a louis that smells confoundedly of straw . '' <EOS>	67.18902394351755
<SOS> mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said : `` porthos would be angry , my dear monsieur mousqueton , but i pardon you , only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke , so be gay come along . '' <EOS>	66.28671030200418
<SOS> mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance , saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it . <EOS>	51.3559666140654
<SOS> whilst this went on , porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face , and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry . <EOS>	51.24759085734196
<SOS> `` ah , that 's it ! '' <EOS>	116.52913266153602
<SOS> he cried , `` you have your promotion and i my barony . '' <EOS>	53.559597708521885
<SOS> `` we are going to fetch our brevets , '' said d'artagnan , `` and when we come back , master mazarin will sign them . '' <EOS>	86.57809466011074
<SOS> `` and where are we going ? '' <EOS>	54.17156697160186
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	61.461305634559665
<SOS> `` to paris first ; i have affairs to settle . '' <EOS>	94.04332831614062
<SOS> and they both set out for paris . <EOS>	106.74314335129405
<SOS> on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital . <EOS>	66.42588848842827
<SOS> around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations , whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say , an old man and two women . <EOS>	50.91488937093932
<SOS> on the other hand , as the two friends approached to enter , they showed them every kind of civility , thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own . <EOS>	102.57121395207595
<SOS> `` what is the king doing ? '' <EOS>	73.93758951391227
<SOS> they asked . <EOS>	87.4204652142878
<SOS> `` he is asleep . '' <EOS>	89.36372514610323
<SOS> `` and the spanish woman ? '' <EOS>	112.18507687109499
<SOS> `` dreaming . '' <EOS>	90.30497052391094
<SOS> `` and the cursed italian ? '' <EOS>	95.74397796507873
<SOS> `` he is awake , so keep on the watch , as they are gone away ; it 's for some purpose , rely on it . <EOS>	57.95664408435985
<SOS> but as you are the strongest , after all , '' continued d'artagnan , `` do n't be furious with old men and women , and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions . '' <EOS>	80.25187331486102
<SOS> the people listened to these words and let go the ladies , who thanked d'artagnan with an eloquent look . <EOS>	74.54323625253168
<SOS> `` now ! <EOS>	70.35204084176898
<SOS> onward ! '' <EOS>	115.80896098204032
<SOS> cried the gascon . <EOS>	80.4604034425729
<SOS> and they continued their way , crossing the barricades , getting the chains about their legs , pushed about , questioning and questioned . <EOS>	75.6052672473886
<SOS> in the place of the palais royal d'artagnan saw a sergeant , who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens . <EOS>	90.86938415272519
<SOS> it was planchet , who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont . <EOS>	61.604451745476055
<SOS> in passing before d'artagnan he recognized his former master . <EOS>	72.1993757286168
<SOS> `` good day , monsieur d'artagnan , '' said planchet proudly . <EOS>	108.16215170156846
<SOS> `` good day , monsieur dulaurier , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	102.0523264277217
<SOS> planchet stopped short , staring at d'artagnan . <EOS>	63.91614655153616
<SOS> the first row , seeing their sergeant stop , stopped in their turn , and so on to the very last . <EOS>	63.573491676136335
<SOS> `` these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous , '' observed d'artagnan to porthos and went on his way . <EOS>	62.71630988169816
<SOS> five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette , where pretty madeleine , the hostess , came to him . <EOS>	66.03949970209858
<SOS> `` my dear mistress turquaine , '' said the gascon , `` if you happen to have any money , lock it up quickly ; if you happen to have any jewels , hide them directly ; if you happen to have any debtors , make them pay you , or any creditors , do n't pay them . '' <EOS>	76.78421525246533
<SOS> `` why , prithee ? '' <EOS>	62.627026773019566
<SOS> asked madeleine . <EOS>	112.6353198220301
<SOS> `` because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon , of which you have no doubt heard tell . '' <EOS>	75.1836906470172
<SOS> `` and are you going to leave me at such a time ? '' <EOS>	44.79286578002741
<SOS> `` this very instant . '' <EOS>	66.50769087416225
<SOS> `` and where are you going ? '' <EOS>	71.7836204626247
<SOS> `` ah , if you could tell me that , you would be doing me a service . '' <EOS>	77.25440961574881
<SOS> `` ah , me ! <EOS>	92.1548449512121
<SOS> ah , me ! <EOS>	58.4270454945627
<SOS> `` have you any letters for me ? '' <EOS>	51.738398666864136
<SOS> inquired d'artagnan , wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief . <EOS>	103.90116589755658
<SOS> `` there 's one just arrived , '' and she handed the letter to d'artagnan . <EOS>	46.79181788669726
<SOS> `` from athos ! '' <EOS>	40.608407505408856
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , recognizing the handwriting . <EOS>	65.66412501020103
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	73.53390623713605
<SOS> said porthos , `` let us hear what he says . '' <EOS>	48.191058339131835
<SOS> d'artagnan opened the letter and read as follows : `` dear d'artagnan , dear du vallon , my good friends , perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me . <EOS>	93.3431059234635
<SOS> aramis and i are very unhappy ; but god , our courage , and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us . <EOS>	91.26088543234133
<SOS> think often of raoul . <EOS>	69.4687989028051
<SOS> i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois ; and in two months and a half , if you do not hear of us , take possession of them . <EOS>	92.84705644187238
<SOS> `` embrace , with all your heart , the vicomte , for your devoted , friend , `` athos . '' <EOS>	74.85347590171241
<SOS> `` i believe , by heaven , '' said d'artagnan , `` that i shall embrace him , since he 's upon our road ; and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos , from that very day he becomes my son . '' <EOS>	58.31400850765395
<SOS> `` and i , '' said porthos , `` shall make him my sole heir . '' <EOS>	85.18737879856596
<SOS> `` let us see , what more does athos say ? '' <EOS>	73.94382840823654
<SOS> `` should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt , distrust him , in a letter i can not say more . '' <EOS>	85.14975633072072
<SOS> `` monsieur mordaunt ! '' <EOS>	70.79529371542495
<SOS> exclaimed the gascon , surprised . <EOS>	96.87522035796503
<SOS> `` monsieur mordaunt ! <EOS>	51.30894551889248
<SOS> 't is well , '' said porthos , `` we shall remember that ; but see , there is a postscript from aramis . '' <EOS>	59.11366734649419
<SOS> `` so there is , '' said d'artagnan , and he read : `` we conceal the place where we are , dear friends , knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it . '' <EOS>	66.54820665308974
<SOS> `` confound it , '' interrupted porthos , with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room ; `` are they in danger of dying ? '' <EOS>	79.99774746811997
<SOS> d'artagnan continued : `` athos bequeaths to you raoul , and i bequeath to you my revenge . <EOS>	68.15463281757683
<SOS> if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt , tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck . <EOS>	48.43617815360777
<SOS> i dare not say more in a letter . <EOS>	62.430917055130216
<SOS> `` aramis . '' <EOS>	63.29535663790003
<SOS> `` if that is all , it is easily done , '' said porthos . <EOS>	61.94170180187812
<SOS> `` on the contrary , '' observed d'artagnan , with a vexed look ; `` it would be impossible . '' <EOS>	54.864230039010394
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	78.5108216537789
<SOS> `` it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england . '' <EOS>	56.454093742807196
<SOS> `` well , suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends ? '' <EOS>	82.95522201563192
<SOS> said porthos , with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army . <EOS>	80.67099279907862
<SOS> `` i did think of it , but this letter has neither date nor postmark . '' <EOS>	56.20354835964233
<SOS> `` true , '' said porthos . <EOS>	68.70083808183942
<SOS> and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself , gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard . <EOS>	70.46928373676097
<SOS> as to d'artagnan , he remained standing like a man in consternation , with the deepest affliction depicted on his face . <EOS>	75.51120243937731
<SOS> `` ah , this is not right ; athos insults us ; he wishes to die alone ; it is bad , bad , bad . '' <EOS>	77.22092823121375
<SOS> mousqueton , witnessing this despair , melted into tears in a corner of the room . <EOS>	55.39231143407862
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan , `` all this leads to nothing . <EOS>	80.16297607250975
<SOS> let us go on . <EOS>	78.98645353308959
<SOS> we will embrace raoul , and perhaps he will have news of athos . '' <EOS>	83.40636785057875
<SOS> `` stop an idea ! '' <EOS>	112.51938446316593
<SOS> cried porthos ; `` indeed , my dear d'artagnan , i do n't know how you manage , but you are always full of ideas ; let us go and embrace raoul . '' <EOS>	103.48150896898649
<SOS> `` woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment , '' said mousqueton to himself ; `` i would n't give a farthing for his life . '' <EOS>	95.24883068703515
<SOS> they set out . <EOS>	61.41488458137443
<SOS> on arriving at the rue saint denis , the friends found a vast concourse of people . <EOS>	88.76337003670746
<SOS> it was the duc de beaufort , who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians , intoxicated with joy . <EOS>	54.41251879317932
<SOS> with the duke 's aid they already considered themselves invincible . <EOS>	43.175626684512466
<SOS> the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince , and so reached the saint denis gate . <EOS>	84.8089630217868
<SOS> `` is it true , '' said the guard to the two cavaliers , `` that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris ? '' <EOS>	109.16452776056211
<SOS> `` nothing more certain ; and the best proof of it is , '' said d'artagnan , `` that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome , his father , who is coming in his turn . '' <EOS>	54.12251556157904
<SOS> `` long live de beaufort ! '' <EOS>	77.4580065758313
<SOS> cried the guards , and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass . <EOS>	72.82506759763307
<SOS> once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear . <EOS>	63.75769178963971
<SOS> their horses flew , and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis . <EOS>	68.23783500073166
<SOS> the camp had entered saint omer ; the friends made a little detour and went to the camp , and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen . <EOS>	95.77868304256262
<SOS> they found raoul near his tent , reclining on a truss of hay , of which his horse stole some mouthfuls ; the young man 's eyes were red and he seemed dejected . <EOS>	66.2614228796557
<SOS> the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely . <EOS>	77.90479070639321
<SOS> and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms . <EOS>	70.68738427419507
<SOS> `` oh , is it you , dear friends ? <EOS>	66.96086041980955
<SOS> did you come here to fetch me ? <EOS>	99.91740361489161
<SOS> will you take me away with you ? <EOS>	81.2274641857814
<SOS> do you bring me tidings of my guardian ? '' <EOS>	51.81046781368184
<SOS> `` have you not received any ? '' <EOS>	103.9776280070865
<SOS> said d'artagnan to the youth . <EOS>	48.14728512521942
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	49.96446542795068
<SOS> sir , no , and i do not know what has become of him ; so that i am really so unhappy that i weep . '' <EOS>	43.06325811724748
<SOS> in fact , tears rolled down his cheeks . <EOS>	43.20545723395468
<SOS> porthos turned aside , in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind . <EOS>	66.74900674396322
<SOS> `` deuce take it ! '' <EOS>	114.57273121571859
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , more moved than he had been for a long time , `` do n't despair , my friend , if you have not received any letters from the count , we have received one . '' <EOS>	75.33837588373667
<SOS> `` oh , really ! '' <EOS>	51.47200946419203
<SOS> cried raoul . <EOS>	73.19160965460648
<SOS> `` and a comforting one , too , '' added d'artagnan , seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man . <EOS>	80.4811585428547
<SOS> `` have you it ? '' <EOS>	51.9984799721382
<SOS> asked raoul `` yes that is , i had it , '' repined the gascon , making believe to find it . <EOS>	80.76712343090044
<SOS> `` wait , it ought to be there in my pocket ; it speaks of his return , does it not , porthos ? '' <EOS>	86.1145772817359
<SOS> all gascon as he was , d'artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood . <EOS>	73.92889501552176
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied porthos , coughing . <EOS>	74.98021003001293
<SOS> `` eh , give it to me ! '' <EOS>	99.59651749871438
<SOS> said the young man . <EOS>	44.71819838717243
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	62.2648384450069
<SOS> i read it a little while since . <EOS>	61.15999359592026

<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	107.66461885765509

<SOS> yes , my pocket has a hole in it . '' <EOS>	52.524627328779864
<SOS> `` oh , yes , monsieur raoul ! '' <EOS>	58.1312561581615
<SOS> said mousqueton , `` the letter was very consoling . <EOS>	67.82780024324866

<SOS> `` but at any rate , you know where he is , monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	94.22236955838771
<SOS> asked raoul , somewhat comforted . <EOS>	80.18720364121248
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	81.93921550692627
<SOS> that 's the thing ! '' <EOS>	82.62448826939297

<SOS> `` no , not to you , so i am going to tell you where he is . '' <EOS>	69.90394670902207
<SOS> porthos devoured d'artagnan with wondering eyes . <EOS>	78.09026996839819
<SOS> `` where the devil shall i say that he is , so that he can not try to rejoin him ? '' <EOS>	77.25248805775345

<SOS> `` well , where is he , sir ? '' <EOS>	92.21443418773926
<SOS> asked raoul , in a soft and coaxing voice . <EOS>	99.5146135706063
<SOS> `` he is at constantinople . '' <EOS>	46.31592671876059
<SOS> `` among the turks ! '' <EOS>	72.68849808475039

<SOS> `` good heavens ! <EOS>	84.89722521901544

<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	104.00148951772272
<SOS> `` pooh ! <EOS>	91.4720018669206
<SOS> what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d'herblay ? '' <EOS>	65.40817196273876
<SOS> `` ah , his friend is with him ? '' <EOS>	54.38882430584121
<SOS> said raoul . <EOS>	76.82846029458426
<SOS> `` that comforts me a little . '' <EOS>	74.24698861403613
<SOS> `` has he wit or not this demon d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	78.81251903071364
<SOS> said porthos , astonished at his friend 's deception . <EOS>	103.64923673772
<SOS> `` now , sir , '' said d'artagnan , wishing to change the conversation , `` here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier . <EOS>	53.86125176303553
<SOS> i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome . '' <EOS>	77.80290354245243
<SOS> `` i have still twenty pistoles , sir . '' <EOS>	95.98784681375788
<SOS> `` well , take them ; that makes seventy . '' <EOS>	91.25992649244988
<SOS> `` and if you wish for more , '' said porthos , putting his hand to his pocket `` thank you , sir , '' replied raoul , blushing ; `` thank you a thousand times . '' <EOS>	59.60867462862455
<SOS> at this moment olivain appeared . <EOS>	72.40002624962459
<SOS> `` apropos , '' said d'artagnan , loud enough for the servant to hear him , `` are you satisfied with olivain ? '' <EOS>	43.700405240816124
<SOS> `` yes , in some respects , tolerably well . '' <EOS>	68.74047843863907
<SOS> olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent . <EOS>	71.90598039428913
<SOS> `` what fault do you find with the fellow ? '' <EOS>	73.67411926380241

<SOS> cried olivain , reappearing at this accusation . <EOS>	86.86789303339083
<SOS> `` and a little bit of a thief . '' <EOS>	72.13526661306041
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! <EOS>	64.5545305096338
<SOS> oh ! '' <EOS>	43.53437715032179

<SOS> `` the deuce ! '' <EOS>	64.46015606529204

<SOS> do n't be a coward , or i shall cut off your ears . <EOS>	100.11802184695509
<SOS> look at monsieur mouston , see the honorable wounds he has received , observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance . '' <EOS>	80.24689216640405
<SOS> mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced d'artagnan had he dared ; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself . <EOS>	74.87957208507889
<SOS> `` send away that fellow , raoul , '' said the gascon ; `` for if he 's a coward he will disgrace thee some day . '' <EOS>	54.96464113843643
<SOS> `` monsieur says i am coward , '' cried olivain , `` because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont 's regiment and i refused to accompany him . '' <EOS>	65.79290023421032
<SOS> `` monsieur olivain , a lackey ought never to disobey , '' said d'artagnan , sternly ; then taking him aside , he whispered to him : `` thou hast done right ; thy master was in the wrong ; here 's a crown for thee , but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him , i will cut out thy tongue . <EOS>	95.46069236787261
<SOS> remember that . '' <EOS>	63.934422610253755
<SOS> olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket . <EOS>	55.84059530400141
<SOS> `` and now , raoul , '' said the gascon , `` monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors , where , i know not ; but should you want anything , write to madame turquaine , at la chevrette , rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy ; for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d'emery . '' <EOS>	87.88777342511924
<SOS> and having , meantime , embraced his ward , he passed him into the robust arms of porthos , who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant . <EOS>	51.773475227344555
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan , `` let us go . '' <EOS>	62.935014495776315
<SOS> and they set out for boulogne , where toward evening they arrived , their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration . <EOS>	51.69964331322403
<SOS> at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black , who seemed waiting for some one , and who , from the moment he saw them enter the town , never took his eyes off them . <EOS>	115.99292891282845
<SOS> d'artagnan approached him , and seeing him stare so fixedly , said : `` well , friend ! <EOS>	97.86060143924284
<SOS> i do n't like people to quiz me ! '' <EOS>	74.39033852343641
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the young man , `` do you not come from paris , if you please ? '' <EOS>	98.02760910695824
<SOS> d'artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital . <EOS>	51.207335447973456
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' he said , in a softened tone . <EOS>	74.90510389935774
<SOS> `` are you not going to put up at the 'arms of england ' ? '' <EOS>	86.33929634167029

<SOS> mordaunt . '' <EOS>	84.03867851402117
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	111.92109168051263
<SOS> thought d'artagnan , `` the man i am warned against by athos . '' <EOS>	100.36943829517023
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	75.71822454970194
<SOS> thought porthos , `` the man aramis wants me to strangle . '' <EOS>	60.942537481696384
<SOS> they both looked searchingly at the young man , who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition . <EOS>	54.40597214452476
<SOS> `` do you doubt my word ? '' <EOS>	76.33693667176694
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	61.57641466513175
<SOS> `` in that case i can give you proofs . '' <EOS>	76.74821858701736
<SOS> `` no , sir , '' said d'artagnan ; `` and we place ourselves at your orders . '' <EOS>	107.0631117727486
<SOS> `` well , gentlemen , '' resumed mordaunt , `` we must set out without delay , to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal . <EOS>	79.578846082003
<SOS> my ship is ready , and had you not come i must have set off without you , for general cromwell expects my return impatiently . '' <EOS>	61.99814090611081
<SOS> `` so ! '' <EOS>	93.43962259356582
<SOS> thought the lieutenant , `` 't is to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed . '' <EOS>	98.99456147820922
<SOS> `` have you no letter for him ? '' <EOS>	85.8555900007557
<SOS> asked the young man . <EOS>	87.2665551974748
<SOS> `` i have one , the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london ; but since you tell me to whom it is addressed , 't is useless to wait till then . '' <EOS>	65.23757394594925
<SOS> d'artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter . <EOS>	75.77183933082675
<SOS> it was directed to `` monsieur oliver cromwell , general of the army of the english nation . '' <EOS>	75.62203306673136
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	69.76061723599058
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` a singular commission . '' <EOS>	86.17567080034797
<SOS> `` who is this monsieur oliver cromwell ? '' <EOS>	50.972373147598475
<SOS> inquired porthos . <EOS>	60.87386948091928
<SOS> `` formerly a brewer , '' replied the gascon . <EOS>	62.78824720584334
<SOS> `` perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer , as we did in straw , '' said porthos . <EOS>	88.68893971552117
<SOS> `` come , come , gentlemen , '' said mordaunt , impatiently , `` let us depart . '' <EOS>	93.41004909361338
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	57.51190854803572
<SOS> exclaimed porthos `` without supper ? <EOS>	99.99822130560986
<SOS> can not monsieur cromwell wait a little ? '' <EOS>	87.85874883010854
<SOS> `` yes , but i ? '' <EOS>	89.74192602320905
<SOS> said mordaunt . <EOS>	70.14611422051127
<SOS> `` well , you , '' said porthos , `` what then ? '' <EOS>	39.25214172908081
<SOS> `` i can not wait . '' <EOS>	44.894489668823034
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	68.41724419017301
<SOS> as to you , that is not my concern , and i shall sup either with or without your permission . '' <EOS>	106.41034193064702
<SOS> the young man 's eyes kindled in secret , but he restrained himself . <EOS>	79.11488889343
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said d'artagnan , `` you must excuse famished travelers . <EOS>	77.77248063968848
<SOS> besides , our supper ca n't delay you much . <EOS>	71.5636834026324
<SOS> we will hasten on to the inn ; you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor . <EOS>	61.806012876505655
<SOS> we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are . '' <EOS>	89.38108407685857
<SOS> `` just as you please , gentlemen , provided we set sail , '' he said . <EOS>	86.39283050876692
<SOS> `` the name of your ship ? '' <EOS>	98.79329083511178
<SOS> inquired d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.51250017232961
<SOS> `` the standard . '' <EOS>	83.72176888443501
<SOS> `` very well ; in half an hour we shall be on board . '' <EOS>	84.77108858866683
<SOS> and the friends , spurring on their horses , rode to the hotel , the `` arms of england . '' <EOS>	78.21322031773846
<SOS> `` what do you say of that young man ? '' <EOS>	89.0592030253433
<SOS> asked d'artagnan , as they hurried along . <EOS>	96.81147064209652
<SOS> `` i say that he does n't suit me at all , '' said porthos , `` and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis 's advice . '' <EOS>	100.81111441029552
<SOS> `` by no means , my dear porthos ; that man is a messenger of general cromwell ; it would insure for us a poor reception , i imagine , should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant . '' <EOS>	62.580054540200294
<SOS> `` nevertheless , '' said porthos , `` i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice . '' <EOS>	58.14553792480289
<SOS> `` listen , '' returned d'artagnan , `` when our embassy is finished `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	47.267477647287954
<SOS> `` if it brings us back to france `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	68.2330907708444
<SOS> `` well , we shall see . '' <EOS>	52.21476852698998
<SOS> at that moment the two friends reached the hotel , `` arms of england , '' where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port . <EOS>	55.93183601450039
<SOS> there they found a brig ready to set sail , upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently . <EOS>	52.431532679627686
<SOS> `` it is singular , '' said d'artagnan , whilst the boat was taking them to the standard , `` it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known , but who it was i can not yet remember . '' <EOS>	77.65748136648811
<SOS> a few minutes later they were on board , but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men , and it was eight o'clock before they raised anchor . <EOS>	66.9688394907813
<SOS> the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread . <EOS>	90.21234163829548
<SOS> porthos , completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback , retired to his cabin and went to sleep . <EOS>	43.91031780994552
<SOS> d'artagnan , overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt , walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk . <EOS>	64.78000825358004
<SOS> mousqueton was seasick . <EOS>	38.835093346903705
<SOS> chapter lv . <EOS>	60.9915566805469
<SOS> the scotchman . <EOS>	64.65725398430939
<SOS> and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably , not toward london , where d'artagnan and porthos believed they were going , but to durham , whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne , and accompany us to the royalist camp , on this side of the tyne , near newcastle . <EOS>	83.33435879717888
<SOS> there , placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland , but still on english soil , the tents of a little army extended . <EOS>	88.81101386704339
<SOS> it was midnight . <EOS>	50.05701913897036
<SOS> some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch . <EOS>	106.26680996511305
<SOS> the moon , which was partially obscured by heavy clouds , now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels , or silvered the walls , the roofs , and the spires of the town that charles i. had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops , whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement . <EOS>	59.16462892347195
<SOS> at one of the extremities of the camp , near an immense tent , in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council , presided over by lord leven , their commander , a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf , his right hand extended over his sword . <EOS>	52.48674437074477
<SOS> about fifty paces off , another man , also appareled as a cavalier , was talking to a scotch sentinel , and , though a foreigner , he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect . <EOS>	69.56764801182074
<SOS> as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke , and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him ; perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel . <EOS>	84.6274127018203
<SOS> the former had no doubt finished his questions , for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier . <EOS>	85.28236580656629
<SOS> in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him . <EOS>	48.91774675690652
<SOS> `` well , my dear friend ? '' <EOS>	94.1229518507583
<SOS> said he , in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours . <EOS>	69.26389354221676
<SOS> `` well , my friend , there is not a moment to lose ; we must let the king know immediately . '' <EOS>	104.95890023371685
<SOS> `` why , what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	111.35841001031598
<SOS> `` it would take too long to tell you , besides , you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all . <EOS>	75.71772247911576
<SOS> we must go and find lord winter . '' <EOS>	56.192781311955116
<SOS> they both set off to the other end of the camp , but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for . <EOS>	84.52945485928886
<SOS> `` tony , is your master sleeping ? '' <EOS>	90.01579639224792
<SOS> said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment , which served as a kind of ante room . <EOS>	98.49031972632223
<SOS> `` no , monsieur le comte , '' answered the servant , `` i think not ; or at least he has not long been so , for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king , and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes . <EOS>	93.45053518072127
<SOS> however , you may look and see , '' added the lackey , raising the curtained entrance of the tent . <EOS>	48.994666574745445
<SOS> lord winter was seated near an aperture , arranged as a window to let in the night air , his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon , intermittently veiled , as we before observed , by heavy clouds . <EOS>	56.69129028384464
<SOS> the two friends approached winter , who , with his head on his hands , was gazing at the heavens ; he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder . <EOS>	76.96005997413607
<SOS> he turned around , recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them . <EOS>	85.03166156636814
<SOS> `` have you observed , '' said he to them , `` what a blood red color the moon has to night ? '' <EOS>	80.58511944495734
<SOS> `` no , '' replied athos ; `` i thought it looked much the same as usual . '' <EOS>	78.17909814833074
<SOS> `` look , again , chevalier , '' returned lord winter . <EOS>	81.97531226684937
<SOS> `` i must own , '' said aramis , `` i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it . '' <EOS>	66.65478348607627
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said athos , `` in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens . <EOS>	63.0180931891912
<SOS> have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them ? '' <EOS>	79.05755654765109
<SOS> `` the scotch ? '' <EOS>	62.78037034206448
<SOS> inquired winter . <EOS>	58.55536699760418
<SOS> `` what scotch ? '' <EOS>	63.32708856363378
<SOS> `` ours , egad ! '' <EOS>	48.1238041859528
<SOS> exclaimed athos . <EOS>	62.909199923798525
<SOS> `` those in whom the king has confided lord leven 's highlanders . '' <EOS>	52.13400221460801
<SOS> `` no , '' said winter , then he paused ; `` but tell me , can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens ? '' <EOS>	54.645171104680834
<SOS> `` not the least in the world , '' said aramis and athos at once . <EOS>	79.33281659957824
<SOS> `` tell me , '' continued winter , always possessed by the same idea , `` is there not a tradition in france that henry iv. , the evening before the day he was assassinated , when he was playing at chess with m. de bassompiere , saw clots of blood upon the chessboard ? '' <EOS>	84.49036456509617
<SOS> `` yes , '' said athos , `` and the marechal has often told me so himself . '' <EOS>	114.20479229130474
<SOS> `` then it was so , '' murmured winter , `` and the next day henry iv . <EOS>	69.06420623787773
<SOS> was killed . '' <EOS>	71.11300664717712
<SOS> `` but what has this vision of henry iv . <EOS>	90.94290510963408
<SOS> to do with you , my lord ? '' <EOS>	62.27568936071078
<SOS> inquired aramis . <EOS>	51.958273855374976
<SOS> `` nothing ; and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things , when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news . '' <EOS>	99.11254661119939
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , '' said athos , `` i wish to speak to the king . '' <EOS>	91.01365742424295
<SOS> `` to the king ! <EOS>	84.70374582098954
<SOS> but the king is asleep . '' <EOS>	64.8477129075057
<SOS> `` i have something important to reveal to him . '' <EOS>	91.66663865375281
<SOS> `` can it not be put off till to morrow ? '' <EOS>	94.0060465330741
<SOS> `` he must know it this moment , and perhaps it is already too late . '' <EOS>	78.74338416887322
<SOS> `` come , then , '' said lord winter . <EOS>	59.04979882610811
<SOS> lord winter 's tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee , a kind of corridor communicating between the two . <EOS>	87.95087678713885
<SOS> this corridor was guarded , not by a sentinel , but by a confidential servant , through whom , in case of urgency , charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject . <EOS>	92.36145182290443
<SOS> `` these gentlemen are with me , '' said winter . <EOS>	72.65145970224124
<SOS> the lackey bowed and let them pass . <EOS>	68.70746497410826
<SOS> as he had said , on a camp bed , dressed in his black doublet , booted , unbelted , with his felt hat beside him , lay the king , overcome by sleep and fatigue . <EOS>	53.51569654122212
<SOS> they advanced , and athos , who was the first to enter , gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face , framed in its long and now untidy , matted hair , the blue veins showing through the transparent temples , his eyes seemingly swollen by tears . <EOS>	83.79689895051312
<SOS> athos sighed deeply ; the sigh woke the king , so lightly did he sleep . <EOS>	90.54463963905091
<SOS> he opened his eyes . <EOS>	73.34400108486781
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	67.96242481965879
<SOS> said he , raising himself on his elbow , `` is it you , comte de la fere ? '' <EOS>	108.98224921358246
<SOS> `` yes , sire , '' replied athos . <EOS>	77.5783178393285
<SOS> `` you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news ? '' <EOS>	79.11281315532862
<SOS> `` alas , sire , '' answered athos , `` your majesty has guessed aright . '' <EOS>	83.44724086204889
<SOS> `` it is bad news ? '' <EOS>	70.19171594735093
<SOS> `` yes , sire . '' <EOS>	101.24444306562116
<SOS> `` never mind ; the messenger is welcome . <EOS>	67.72696392131256
<SOS> you never come to me without conferring pleasure . <EOS>	75.13128369363126
<SOS> you whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune , you who are sent to me by henrietta ; whatever news you bring , speak out . '' <EOS>	54.77537885327274
<SOS> `` sire , cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle . '' <EOS>	79.863840406783
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	84.26351670891846
<SOS> exclaimed the king , `` to fight ? '' <EOS>	45.73139907618848
<SOS> `` no , sire , but to buy your majesty . '' <EOS>	84.93862647635709
<SOS> `` what did you say ? '' <EOS>	39.89477660110541
<SOS> `` i said , sire , that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army . '' <EOS>	93.387863063381
<SOS> `` for unpaid wages ; yes , i know it . <EOS>	88.02785008373597
<SOS> for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone . '' <EOS>	87.68869224788118
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	46.59056669519544
<SOS> `` well , sir , though honor is a fine thing , they are tired of fighting for it , and to night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds that is to say , for half what is owing them . '' <EOS>	78.44266899949028
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	60.94372188332113
<SOS> cried the king , `` the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds ! <EOS>	76.90211837702716
<SOS> and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain ? '' <EOS>	49.73565721523329
<SOS> `` lord leven . '' <EOS>	63.49688161153763

<SOS> `` i heard it with my own ears . '' <EOS>	94.93250620341799
<SOS> the king sighed deeply , as if his heart would break , and then buried his face in his hands . <EOS>	61.42207324346562
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	61.52216611669299
<SOS> the scotch , '' he exclaimed , `` the scotch i called 'my faithful , ' to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford ! <EOS>	63.21490679295204

<SOS> `` lying behind the tent of lord leven , i raised it and saw all , heard all ! '' <EOS>	103.25622591407519
<SOS> `` and when is this to be consummated ? '' <EOS>	62.09916671281605
<SOS> `` to day this morning ; so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose ! '' <EOS>	90.78145022207055
<SOS> `` to do what ? <EOS>	71.4791929456562

<SOS> `` to cross the tyne , reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose , who will not sell you . '' <EOS>	68.58426404785787
<SOS> `` and what shall i do in scotland ? <EOS>	76.47489307480944
<SOS> a war of partisans , unworthy of a king . '' <EOS>	70.05152157407379
<SOS> `` the example of robert bruce will absolve you , sire . '' <EOS>	56.09432190428627
<SOS> `` no , no ! <EOS>	90.4149119295212
<SOS> i have fought too long ; they have sold me , they shall give me up , and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads . '' <EOS>	79.31232637673193
<SOS> `` sire , '' said athos , `` perhaps a king should act thus , but not a husband and a father . <EOS>	91.11292015520593
<SOS> i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london , and i say to you , 'live , sire , ' it is the will of heaven . '' <EOS>	80.0881097168557
<SOS> the king raised himself , buckled on his belt , and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead , said : `` well , what is to be done ? '' <EOS>	75.04420444188592
<SOS> `` sire , have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely ? '' <EOS>	48.82832657926278
<SOS> `` winter , '' said the king , `` do you believe in the fidelity of yours ? '' <EOS>	91.76339910202118
<SOS> `` sire , they are but men , and men are become both weak and wicked . <EOS>	68.85988682417842
<SOS> i will not answer for them . <EOS>	79.24091502587291
<SOS> i would confide my life to them , but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty 's . '' <EOS>	102.77216707101637
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	67.40599151709839
<SOS> said athos , `` since you have not a regiment , we are three devoted men . <EOS>	95.00702647837568
<SOS> it is enough . <EOS>	85.84394995119298
<SOS> let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us ; we will cross the tyne , reach scotland , and you will be saved . '' <EOS>	61.512553701513916
<SOS> `` is this your counsel also , winter ? '' <EOS>	84.23138851360842
<SOS> inquired the king . <EOS>	90.35565709470349
<SOS> `` yes , sire . '' <EOS>	122.9459210696639
<SOS> `` and yours , monsieur d'herblay ? '' <EOS>	103.30563135940466
<SOS> `` yes , sire . '' <EOS>	57.3301872227828
<SOS> `` as you wish , then . <EOS>	75.68274451776102
<SOS> winter , give the necessary orders . '' <EOS>	94.5497804520418
<SOS> winter then left the tent ; in the meantime the king finished his toilet . <EOS>	78.67174585155551
<SOS> the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it . <EOS>	97.67389464125884
<SOS> `` all is ready , sire , '' said he . <EOS>	64.27739383205727
<SOS> `` for us , also ? '' <EOS>	59.266938427639
<SOS> inquired athos . <EOS>	78.53408640416114
<SOS> `` grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses , ready saddled . '' <EOS>	97.38417895345222
<SOS> `` in that case , '' exclaimed athos , `` let us not lose an instant , but set off . '' <EOS>	63.17042386561975
<SOS> `` come , '' added the king . <EOS>	57.077075210765244
<SOS> `` sire , '' said aramis , `` will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this ? '' <EOS>	96.31701933932067
<SOS> `` friends ! '' <EOS>	115.46119303834486
<SOS> answered charles , sadly , `` i have but three one of twenty years , who has never forgotten me , and two of a week 's standing , whom i shall never forget . <EOS>	72.4166297916347
<SOS> come , gentlemen , come ! '' <EOS>	66.13168687240544
<SOS> the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him . <EOS>	63.123954975646846
<SOS> it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond . <EOS>	89.281153954038
<SOS> the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him . <EOS>	69.92643658645862
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	84.9037728513294
<SOS> said the king , `` i was unjust ; here is a creature that loves me . <EOS>	73.69193873795173
<SOS> you at least will be faithful to me , arthur . '' <EOS>	79.71207907592125
<SOS> the horse , as if it understood these words , bent its red nostrils toward the king 's face , and parting his lips displayed all its teeth , as if with pleasure . <EOS>	83.10867786467819
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said the king , caressing it with his hand , `` yes , my arthur , thou art a fond and faithful creature . '' <EOS>	82.53264173587338
<SOS> after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle , and turning to athos , aramis and winter , said : `` now , gentlemen , i am at your service . '' <EOS>	64.19107093189207
<SOS> but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp . <EOS>	109.19222752206656
<SOS> `` what is that line ? '' <EOS>	75.21158377485725
<SOS> cried athos , whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak . <EOS>	68.29109441137936
<SOS> `` what is that line ? <EOS>	70.21233897019135
<SOS> i did not observe it yesterday . '' <EOS>	86.84582829263749
<SOS> `` it must be the fog rising from the river , '' said the king . <EOS>	104.91444842794375
<SOS> `` sire , it is something more opaque than the fog . '' <EOS>	113.39542032055282
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	90.15922426575541
<SOS> said winter , `` it appears to me like a bar of red color . '' <EOS>	53.04622861008717
<SOS> `` it is the enemy , who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us ! '' <EOS>	70.88213390406922
<SOS> exclaimed athos . <EOS>	51.92814172280886
<SOS> `` the enemy ! '' <EOS>	66.14499379976115
<SOS> cried the king . <EOS>	58.00665630115699
<SOS> `` yes , the enemy . <EOS>	69.34246971252018
<SOS> it is too late . <EOS>	56.23587540801427
<SOS> stop a moment ; does not that sunbeam yonder , just by the side of the town , glitter on the ironsides ? '' <EOS>	66.07971463573601
<SOS> this was the name given the cuirassiers , whom cromwell had made his body guard . <EOS>	85.87409409476804
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	71.73221263272715
<SOS> said the king , `` we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not . '' <EOS>	69.66515242735426
<SOS> `` what are you going to do ? '' <EOS>	64.09277462817153
<SOS> exclaimed athos . <EOS>	74.64556667536462
<SOS> `` to give them the order to charge , and run down these miserable rebels . '' <EOS>	43.256077534355946
<SOS> and the king , putting spurs to his horse , set off to the tent of lord leven . <EOS>	79.84037100153265
<SOS> `` follow him , '' said athos . <EOS>	67.77803925908826
<SOS> `` come ! '' <EOS>	75.28757039446523
<SOS> exclaimed aramis . <EOS>	60.93708834194067
<SOS> `` is the king wounded ? '' <EOS>	88.37130133973348
<SOS> cried lord winter . <EOS>	96.68392314114415
<SOS> `` i see spots of blood on the ground . '' <EOS>	73.80448834080923
<SOS> and he set off to follow the two friends . <EOS>	49.13944025178414
<SOS> he was stopped by athos . <EOS>	42.767988291726574
<SOS> `` go and call out your regiment , '' said he ; `` i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly . '' <EOS>	79.54592911504403
<SOS> winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on . <EOS>	51.81729095692812
<SOS> it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander ; he dismounted and entered . <EOS>	56.84289947436129
<SOS> the general was there , surrounded by the more prominent chiefs . <EOS>	68.00859341771852
<SOS> `` the king ! '' <EOS>	63.45925485248885
<SOS> they exclaimed , as all rose in bewilderment . <EOS>	94.16215646115154
<SOS> charles was indeed in the midst of them , his hat on his head , his brows bent , striking his boot with his riding whip . <EOS>	87.63062425843594
<SOS> `` yes , gentlemen , the king in person , the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened . '' <EOS>	54.535530269018246
<SOS> `` what is the matter , sire ? '' <EOS>	103.56647020633162
<SOS> exclaimed lord leven . <EOS>	58.898964302097305
<SOS> `` it is this , sir , '' said the king , angrily , `` that general cromwell has reached newcastle ; that you knew it and i was not informed of it ; that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us ; that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it ; that , by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament . <EOS>	78.03911322727807
<SOS> of this treaty , at least , i have been warned . <EOS>	91.69224503470771
<SOS> this is the matter , gentlemen ; answer and exculpate yourselves , for i stand here to accuse you . '' <EOS>	58.9045744339379
<SOS> `` sire , '' said lord leven , with hesitation , `` sire , your majesty has been deceived by false reports . '' <EOS>	79.28442792547375
<SOS> `` my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland ; and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated . '' <EOS>	69.58275108342266
<SOS> the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows . <EOS>	110.19880263952638
<SOS> `` sire , '' murmured lord leven , crushed by shame , `` sire , we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity . '' <EOS>	101.90372168673845
<SOS> `` i ask but one , '' said the king ; `` put the army in battle array and face the enemy . '' <EOS>	60.13809656283045
<SOS> `` that can not be , sire , '' said the earl . <EOS>	81.26638521712623
<SOS> `` how , can not be ? <EOS>	76.62396452538306
<SOS> what hinders it ? '' <EOS>	58.45027352476178
<SOS> exclaimed the king . <EOS>	79.49734104315228
<SOS> `` your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army . '' <EOS>	96.54411368220013
<SOS> `` and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town , contrary to the agreement which kept it there . <EOS>	108.28305622722738
<SOS> now , i tell you , you must pass with me through this army across to scotland , and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names , which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors ! '' <EOS>	79.45827907953664
<SOS> the eyes of the scotch flashed fire ; and , as often happens on such occasions , from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king . <EOS>	82.9500476535915
<SOS> `` yes , '' said they , `` we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england . <EOS>	88.6926338703338
<SOS> we have promised and we will keep our promise . <EOS>	53.68933272898437
<SOS> charles stuart , you are our prisoner . '' <EOS>	66.48978364976664
<SOS> and both extended their hands as if to seize the king , but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers , both had fallen , one dead , the other stunned . <EOS>	92.12671169950052
<SOS> aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol . <EOS>	57.51488528737782
<SOS> then , as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue , which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner , athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured , and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent . <EOS>	91.81330701816938
<SOS> on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment . <EOS>	74.80943264652767
<SOS> the king motioned him to accompany them . <EOS>	43.95793417360318
<SOS> chapter lvi . <EOS>	77.90186112849325
<SOS> the avenger . <EOS>	90.30377877725891
<SOS> they all four entered the tent ; they had no plan ready they must think of one . <EOS>	75.07461375659716
<SOS> the king threw himself into an arm chair . <EOS>	90.5979000481444
<SOS> `` i am lost , '' said he . <EOS>	79.42180698028889
<SOS> `` no , sire , '' replied athos . <EOS>	59.1668050564303
<SOS> `` you are only betrayed . '' <EOS>	68.4115639689336
<SOS> the king sighed deeply . <EOS>	105.73497568674344
<SOS> `` betrayed ! <EOS>	55.7641595976378
<SOS> yes betrayed by the scotch , amongst whom i was born , whom i have always loved better than the english . <EOS>	47.8765380165724
<SOS> oh , traitors that ye are ! '' <EOS>	79.2863154506622
<SOS> `` sire , '' said athos , `` this is not a moment for recrimination , but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman . <EOS>	79.95645533967426
<SOS> up , sire ! <EOS>	77.50326291925586
<SOS> up ! <EOS>	49.168828632297625
<SOS> for you have here at least three men who will not betray you . <EOS>	114.22189254342938
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	49.673439602745425
<SOS> if we had been five ! '' <EOS>	81.90453810300066
<SOS> murmured athos , thinking of d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	95.78602783499069
<SOS> `` what do you say ? '' <EOS>	57.654319108592134
<SOS> inquired charles , rising . <EOS>	107.87579662488578
<SOS> `` i say , sire , that there is now but one way open . <EOS>	84.12812177086305
<SOS> lord winter answers for his regiment , or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men , we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty , and we will mow a swath through cromwell 's army and reach scotland . '' <EOS>	80.35256960216181
<SOS> `` there is another method , '' said aramis . <EOS>	65.65150771148609
<SOS> `` let one of us put on the dress and mount the king 's horse . <EOS>	63.50721364998094
<SOS> whilst they pursue him the king might escape . '' <EOS>	65.96271756514975
<SOS> `` it is good advice , '' said athos , `` and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him . '' <EOS>	97.41343952331819
<SOS> `` what do you think of this counsel , winter ? '' <EOS>	71.59230371338441
<SOS> asked the king , looking with admiration at these two men , whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him . <EOS>	43.319258792772054
<SOS> `` i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d'herblay . <EOS>	62.82089895035528
<SOS> i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly , for we have not an instant to lose . '' <EOS>	67.98248345495679
<SOS> `` but if i accept , it is death , or at least imprisonment , for him who takes my place . '' <EOS>	110.25740819016895
<SOS> `` he will have had the glory of having saved his king , '' cried winter . <EOS>	69.1716564049883
<SOS> the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes ; undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore , to honor the two frenchmen who were with him , and passed it around winter 's neck , who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign 's confidence and friendship . <EOS>	75.11011356843349
<SOS> `` it is right , '' said athos ; `` he has served your majesty longer than we have . '' <EOS>	100.42183732727561
<SOS> the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes . <EOS>	47.925838416032825
<SOS> `` wait a moment , sir , '' said he ; `` i have an order for each of you also . '' <EOS>	44.896465760736845
<SOS> he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up , and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter . <EOS>	75.79270680545979
<SOS> `` these can not be for us , '' said athos . <EOS>	81.72552871927488
<SOS> `` why not , sir ? '' <EOS>	59.987729002759025
<SOS> asked charles . <EOS>	95.56255513501918
<SOS> `` such are for royalty , and we are simple commoners . '' <EOS>	80.33798225682705
<SOS> `` speak not of crowns . <EOS>	57.45584841571096
<SOS> i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours . <EOS>	71.76452470610127
<SOS> no , no , you do yourselves injustice ; but i am here to do you justice . <EOS>	88.63843598306623
<SOS> on your knees , count . '' <EOS>	54.0904177810458
<SOS> athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual , raised his sword , and instead of pronouncing the customary formula , `` i make you a knight . <EOS>	96.28777506338925
<SOS> be brave , faithful and loyal , '' he said , `` you are brave , faithful and loyal . <EOS>	74.10636057680112
<SOS> i knight you , monsieur le comte . '' <EOS>	54.9806891554561
<SOS> then turning to aramis , he said : `` it is now your turn , monsieur le chevalier . '' <EOS>	45.38916587641754
<SOS> the same ceremony recommenced , with the same words , whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass , that he might disguise himself like the king . <EOS>	114.44274102631809
<SOS> charles , having proceeded with aramis as with athos , embraced them both . <EOS>	66.23538509194839
<SOS> `` sire , '' said winter , who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up , `` we are ready . '' <EOS>	61.75178348405246
<SOS> the king looked at the three gentlemen . <EOS>	47.02023168617214
<SOS> `` then we must fly ! '' <EOS>	57.719829744935076
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	77.35724729042008
<SOS> `` flying through an army , sire , '' said athos , `` in all countries in the world is called charging . '' <EOS>	52.844111218659094
<SOS> `` then i shall die , sword in hand , '' said charles . <EOS>	89.93585032817201
<SOS> `` monsieur le comte , monsieur le chevalier , if ever i am king `` `` sire , you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to , therefore gratitude is on our side . <EOS>	51.53239300458836
<SOS> but we must not lose time . <EOS>	48.85856148184231
<SOS> we have already wasted too much . '' <EOS>	76.36734372472476
<SOS> the king again shook hands with all three , exchanged hats with winter and went out . <EOS>	83.27901453107
<SOS> winter 's regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp . <EOS>	70.24570322894279
<SOS> the king , followed by the three friends , turned his steps that way . <EOS>	66.64819821497638
<SOS> the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened ; the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array . <EOS>	85.83565272171197
<SOS> `` do you see that ? '' <EOS>	81.52161641920819
<SOS> said the king . <EOS>	88.47461407280196
<SOS> `` perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march . '' <EOS>	55.808713058533016
<SOS> `` if they are penitent , '' said athos , `` let them follow us . '' <EOS>	87.4315918250019
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	101.79155853241484
<SOS> said the king , `` what shall we do ? '' <EOS>	43.908826405100015
<SOS> `` let us examine the enemy 's army . '' <EOS>	46.06049144963919
<SOS> at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle . <EOS>	106.78052801899776
<SOS> the air was soft and clear , as it generally is at that early hour of the morning . <EOS>	89.94271737606041
<SOS> the regiments , the standards , and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct . <EOS>	86.48630733599342
<SOS> on the summit of a rising ground , a little in advance of the enemy , appeared a short and heavy looking man ; this man was surrounded by officers . <EOS>	50.021018139406145
<SOS> he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood . <EOS>	86.65945307778085
<SOS> `` does this man know your majesty personally ? '' <EOS>	84.51490216505508
<SOS> inquired aramis . <EOS>	79.80246971143205
<SOS> charles smiled . <EOS>	105.8926796000758
<SOS> `` that man is cromwell , '' said he . <EOS>	59.96567443913078
<SOS> `` then draw down your hat , sire , that he may not discover the substitution . '' <EOS>	53.11979425695406
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	67.82618712957759
<SOS> said athos , `` how much time we have lost . '' <EOS>	85.33297720668297
<SOS> `` now , '' said the king , `` give the word and let us start . '' <EOS>	76.5133041844175
<SOS> `` will you not give it , sire ? '' <EOS>	89.11204434264887
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	74.36478535619828
<SOS> `` no ; i make you my lieutenant general , '' said the king . <EOS>	105.07881750794317
<SOS> `` listen , then , lord winter . <EOS>	58.75132212542148
<SOS> proceed , sire , i beg . <EOS>	65.39051665016154
<SOS> what we are going to say does not concern your majesty . '' <EOS>	92.56907713320439
<SOS> the king , smiling , turned a few steps back . <EOS>	56.13875315048947
<SOS> `` this is what i propose to do , '' said athos . <EOS>	69.21665091356235
<SOS> `` we will divide our regiments into two squadrons . <EOS>	84.41391443950052
<SOS> you will put yourself at the head of the first . <EOS>	65.6321735413237
<SOS> we and his majesty will lead the second . <EOS>	67.6596367367663
<SOS> if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together , force the enemy 's line and throw ourselves into the tyne , which we must cross , either by fording or swimming ; if , on the contrary , any repulse should take place , you and your men must fight to the last man , whilst we and the king proceed on our road . <EOS>	51.2964809529911
<SOS> once arrived at the brink of the river , should we even find them three ranks deep , as long as you and your regiment do your duty , we will look to the rest . '' <EOS>	74.22752286841242
<SOS> `` to horse ! '' <EOS>	76.35863422912828
<SOS> said lord winter . <EOS>	94.82945263769955
<SOS> `` to horse ! '' <EOS>	77.47206533661954
<SOS> re echoed athos ; `` everything is arranged and decided . '' <EOS>	106.86777800180319
<SOS> `` now , gentlemen , '' cried the king , `` forward ! <EOS>	55.280616529445766
<SOS> and rally to the old cry of france , 'montjoy and st . <EOS>	88.86367949655973
<SOS> denis ! ' <EOS>	78.7589116292964
<SOS> the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors . '' <EOS>	85.92153070722188
<SOS> they mounted the king on winter 's horse and winter on that of the king ; then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron , and the king , with athos on his right and aramis on his left , at the head of the second . <EOS>	103.36907114289858
<SOS> the scotch army stood motionless and silent , seized with shame at sight of these preparations . <EOS>	46.2777817356289
<SOS> some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two . <EOS>	79.06008130516388
<SOS> `` there , '' said the king , `` that consoles me ; they are not all traitors . '' <EOS>	77.06953121828845
<SOS> at this moment winter 's voice was raised with the cry of `` forward ! '' <EOS>	122.7938924368854
<SOS> the first squadron moved off ; the second followed , and descended from the plateau . <EOS>	53.21036639591737
<SOS> a regiment of cuirassiers , nearly equal as to numbers , issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it . <EOS>	60.486876340578
<SOS> the king pointed this out . <EOS>	69.21486849331205
<SOS> `` sire , '' said athos , `` we foresaw this ; and if lord winter 's men but do their duty , we are saved , instead of lost . '' <EOS>	59.53781856795551
<SOS> at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter 's voice crying out : `` sword in hand ! '' <EOS>	87.6036257185993
<SOS> at these words every sword was drawn , and glittered in the air like lightning . <EOS>	47.95847905727891
<SOS> `` now , gentlemen , '' said the king in his turn , excited by this sight , `` come , gentlemen , sword in hand ! '' <EOS>	61.31386756220218
<SOS> but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king 's example . <EOS>	79.74690381483258
<SOS> `` we are betrayed , '' said the king in a low voice . <EOS>	49.4274661463381
<SOS> `` wait a moment , '' said athos , `` perhaps they do not recognize your majesty 's voice , and await the order of their captain . '' <EOS>	51.10323196332115
<SOS> `` have they not heard that of their colonel ? <EOS>	64.20948362016935
<SOS> but look ! <EOS>	88.28253877595046
<SOS> look ! '' <EOS>	56.92469269585159
<SOS> cried the king , drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk , which threw it on its haunches , and seizing the bridle of athos 's horse . <EOS>	69.44788608478632
<SOS> `` ah , cowards ! <EOS>	79.172537611711
<SOS> traitors ! '' <EOS>	77.46909262956501
<SOS> screamed lord winter , whose voice they heard , whilst his men , quitting their ranks , dispersed all over the plain . <EOS>	74.39624255312944
<SOS> about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell 's cuirassiers . <EOS>	59.95804500083851
<SOS> `` let us go and die with them ! '' <EOS>	49.52580559792911
<SOS> said the king . <EOS>	80.72726381589322
<SOS> `` let us go , '' said athos and aramis . <EOS>	93.42334111937838
<SOS> `` all faithful hearts with me ! '' <EOS>	64.68225062783408
<SOS> cried out winter . <EOS>	52.29223485996367
<SOS> this voice was heard by the two friends , who set off , full gallop . <EOS>	94.03293878255855
<SOS> `` no quarter ! '' <EOS>	100.1515406575051
<SOS> cried a voice in french , answering to that of winter , which made them tremble . <EOS>	89.29942345448619
<SOS> as for winter , at the sound of that voice he turned pale , and was , as it were , petrified . <EOS>	100.97006168442202
<SOS> it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse , who was charging at the head of the english regiment , of which , in his ardor , he was ten steps in advance . <EOS>	87.65452321301346
<SOS> `` 't is he ! '' <EOS>	102.56699398679012
<SOS> murmured winter , his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side . <EOS>	111.22931807890814
<SOS> `` the king ! <EOS>	69.80755988089265
<SOS> the king ! '' <EOS>	53.19609716808746
<SOS> cried out several voices , deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter ; `` take him alive . '' <EOS>	45.873250193576844
<SOS> `` no ! <EOS>	83.53118784390934
<SOS> it is not the king ! '' <EOS>	101.24056399010922
<SOS> exclaimed the cavalier . <EOS>	72.84271963009597
<SOS> `` lord winter , you are not the king ; you are my uncle . '' <EOS>	55.1428609220579
<SOS> at the same moment mordaunt , for it was he , leveled his pistol at winter ; it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier , who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos , murmuring : `` he is avenged ! '' <EOS>	85.29331733497081
<SOS> `` think of my mother ! '' <EOS>	120.01811426907643
<SOS> shouted mordaunt , as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop . <EOS>	108.77345077079225
<SOS> `` wretch ! '' <EOS>	80.94105388173921
<SOS> exclaimed aramis , raising his pistol as he passed by him ; but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off . <EOS>	72.35929546955605
<SOS> at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out , surrounding the two frenchmen . <EOS>	59.62067080258307
<SOS> athos , after making sure that lord winter was really dead , let fall the corpse and said : `` come , aramis , now for the honor of france ! '' <EOS>	56.98429564102935
<SOS> and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell , mortally wounded . <EOS>	50.540515645081726
<SOS> at the same moment a fearful `` hurrah ! '' <EOS>	94.46996807820778
<SOS> rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads . <EOS>	81.42779688851991
<SOS> suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks , fell upon athos , twined arms of steel around him , and tearing his sword from him , said in his ear : `` silence ! <EOS>	65.96499860532894
<SOS> yield you yield to me , do you not ? '' <EOS>	66.61114789104575
<SOS> a giant had seized also aramis 's two wrists , who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp . <EOS>	62.33558171103553
<SOS> `` d'art `` exclaimed athos , whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand . <EOS>	69.42596566219162
<SOS> `` i am your prisoner , '' said aramis , giving up his sword to porthos . <EOS>	108.1440324084214
<SOS> `` fire , fire ! '' <EOS>	91.1564317379908
<SOS> cried mordaunt , returning to the group surrounding the two friends . <EOS>	97.30327098053336
<SOS> `` and wherefore fire ? '' <EOS>	73.76354107670865
<SOS> said the colonel ; `` every one has yielded . '' <EOS>	88.07701875676938
<SOS> `` it is the son of milady , '' said athos to d'artagnan . <EOS>	73.73638219605671
<SOS> `` i recognize him . '' <EOS>	109.7621309773661
<SOS> `` it is the monk , '' whispered porthos to aramis . <EOS>	57.207510245284695
<SOS> `` i know it . '' <EOS>	62.48118121897701
<SOS> and now the ranks began to open . <EOS>	109.82785661582369
<SOS> d'artagnan held the bridle of athos 's horse and porthos that of aramis . <EOS>	102.66361235086016
<SOS> both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field . <EOS>	83.73012984507812
<SOS> this movement revealed the spot where winter 's body had fallen . <EOS>	43.79343104531345
<SOS> mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred . <EOS>	109.50837713758565
<SOS> athos , though now cool and collected , put his hand to his belt , where his loaded pistols yet remained . <EOS>	91.03218345141245
<SOS> `` what are you about ? '' <EOS>	68.0623594241291
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.10312061326213
<SOS> `` let me kill him . '' <EOS>	80.8932459671558
<SOS> `` we are all four lost , if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him . '' <EOS>	67.83297349036405
<SOS> then turning to the young man he exclaimed : `` a fine prize ! <EOS>	71.84747778333441
<SOS> a fine prize , friend mordaunt ; we have both myself and monsieur du vallon , taken two knights of the garter , nothing less . '' <EOS>	88.28508013754794
<SOS> `` but , '' said mordaunt , looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes , `` these are frenchmen , i imagine . '' <EOS>	65.06740046980279
<SOS> `` i'faith , i do n't know . <EOS>	69.16023986285026
<SOS> are you french , sir ? '' <EOS>	39.1265054473367
<SOS> said he to athos . <EOS>	64.8975438192611
<SOS> `` i am , '' replied the latter , gravely . <EOS>	121.47688635067533
<SOS> `` very well , my dear sir , you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman . '' <EOS>	77.05326198678146
<SOS> `` but the king where is the king ? '' <EOS>	88.69280917767033
<SOS> exclaimed athos , anxiously . <EOS>	47.202805604483665
<SOS> d'artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner 's hand , saying : `` eh ! <EOS>	75.8839546822096
<SOS> the king ? <EOS>	102.05216843341681
<SOS> we have secured him . '' <EOS>	66.14623452427345
<SOS> `` yes , '' said aramis , `` through an infamous act of treason . '' <EOS>	76.36421288862877
<SOS> porthos pressed his friend 's hand and said to him : `` yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! '' <EOS>	63.667270087254934
<SOS> at this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected charles 's retreat , was advancing to meet the english regiments . <EOS>	56.581687214806635
<SOS> the king , who was entirely surrounded , walked alone in a great empty space . <EOS>	96.52915492764704
<SOS> he appeared calm , but it was evidently not without a mighty effort . <EOS>	99.66514444910955
<SOS> drops of perspiration trickled down his face , and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it . <EOS>	80.21408313934774
<SOS> `` behold nebuchadnezzar ! '' <EOS>	70.79296096698013
<SOS> exclaimed an old puritan soldier , whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant . <EOS>	67.12141580853901
<SOS> `` do you call him nebuchadnezzar ? '' <EOS>	84.96278089000837
<SOS> said mordaunt , with a terrible smile ; `` no , it is charles the first , the king , the good king charles , who despoils his subjects to enrich himself . '' <EOS>	101.20292452255008
<SOS> charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this , but did not recognize him . <EOS>	63.053500370963434
<SOS> nevertheless , the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt . <EOS>	85.9171282352797
<SOS> `` bon jour , messieurs ! '' <EOS>	83.034995353628
<SOS> said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	64.36929548050425
<SOS> `` the day has been unfortunate , but it is not your fault , thank god ! <EOS>	73.34554219589704
<SOS> but where is my old friend winter ? '' <EOS>	68.9637703519062
<SOS> the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence . <EOS>	70.519116074746
<SOS> `` in strafford 's company , '' said mordaunt , tauntingly . <EOS>	62.852753678572945
<SOS> charles shuddered . <EOS>	97.13057930746446
<SOS> the demon had known how to wound him . <EOS>	105.5092633056646
<SOS> the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him , the shadow that haunted him by day and night . <EOS>	99.90956058281358
<SOS> the king looked around him . <EOS>	83.45367021868087
<SOS> he saw a corpse at his feet . <EOS>	74.15509627494146
<SOS> it was winter 's . <EOS>	68.43175288760816
<SOS> he uttered not a word , nor shed a tear , but a deadly pallor spread over his face ; he knelt down on the ground , raised winter 's head , and unfastening the order of the saint esprit , placed it on his own breast . <EOS>	85.46991523889285
<SOS> `` lord winter is killed , then ? '' <EOS>	69.77764374917876
<SOS> inquired d'artagnan , fixing his eyes on the corpse . <EOS>	108.50250393255963
<SOS> `` yes , '' said athos , `` by his own nephew . '' <EOS>	94.52362641981817
<SOS> `` come , he was the first of us to go ; peace be to him ! <EOS>	89.83350186328549

<SOS> `` charles stuart , '' said the colonel of the english regiment , approaching the king , who had just put on the insignia of royalty , `` do you yield yourself a prisoner ? '' <EOS>	66.55305102348309
<SOS> `` colonel tomlison , '' said charles , `` kings can not yield ; the man alone submits to force . '' <EOS>	88.17791106924062
<SOS> `` your sword . '' <EOS>	68.61378671381452
<SOS> the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee . <EOS>	82.62230451381097
<SOS> at this moment a horse without a rider , covered with foam , his nostrils extended and eyes all fire , galloped up , and recognizing his master , stopped and neighed with pleasure ; it was arthur . <EOS>	76.79607301300621
<SOS> the king smiled , patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle . <EOS>	66.84295733506427
<SOS> `` now , gentlemen , '' said he , `` conduct me where you will . '' <EOS>	46.09835532767636
<SOS> turning back again , he said , `` i thought i saw winter move ; if he still lives , by all you hold most sacred , do not abandon him . '' <EOS>	113.4803628900782
<SOS> `` never fear , king charles , '' said mordaunt , `` the bullet pierced his heart . '' <EOS>	52.3296248382974
<SOS> `` do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos , '' said d'artagnan to athos and aramis , `` that you recognize this man , for milady is not dead ; her soul lives in the body of this demon . '' <EOS>	85.68351888820919
<SOS> the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive ; but on the road an aide de camp , from cromwell , sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle . <EOS>	71.18039399229873
<SOS> at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell . <EOS>	100.0725026715107

<SOS> oliver cromwell . <EOS>	67.07396274492943
<SOS> have you been to the general ? '' <EOS>	54.56052925949968
<SOS> said mordaunt to d'artagnan and porthos ; `` you know he sent for you after the action . '' <EOS>	62.75965793467188
<SOS> `` we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	114.65193545848885
<SOS> `` do you know , sir , these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds ? '' <EOS>	99.09326378566396
<SOS> `` oh , be assured , '' said mordaunt , looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften , `` my soldiers will guard them , and guard them well , i promise you . '' <EOS>	66.41552898368367
<SOS> `` i shall take better care of them myself , '' answered d'artagnan ; `` besides , all they require is a good room , with sentinels , or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape . <EOS>	64.41937204511056
<SOS> i will go and see about that , and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence . '' <EOS>	53.59940662929025
<SOS> `` you think of starting at once , then ? '' <EOS>	108.72543656379955
<SOS> inquired mordaunt . <EOS>	83.21614370499468
<SOS> `` our mission is ended , and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent . '' <EOS>	75.26901685858405
<SOS> the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant : `` you will follow these men and not lose sight of them ; when you have discovered where they lodge , come and await me at the town gate . '' <EOS>	84.49590318174205
<SOS> the sergeant made a sign of comprehension . <EOS>	118.96306784007778
<SOS> instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town , mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched . <EOS>	86.414859155257
<SOS> cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission ; but the sentinel , who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general , thought the order did not extend to the young man . <EOS>	97.60133735538338
<SOS> mordaunt , therefore , raised the canvas , and saw cromwell seated before a table , his head buried in his hands , his back being turned . <EOS>	89.55587412364022
<SOS> whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered , cromwell did not move . <EOS>	73.02000113167031
<SOS> mordaunt remained standing near the door . <EOS>	47.149223401669346
<SOS> at last , after a few moments , cromwell raised his head , and , as if he divined that some one was there , turned slowly around . <EOS>	68.45931085477734
<SOS> `` i said i wished to be alone , '' he exclaimed , on seeing the young man . <EOS>	83.5108416434147
<SOS> `` they thought this order did not concern me , sir ; nevertheless , if you wish it , i am ready to go . '' <EOS>	69.48340567191681
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	104.38260919013105
<SOS> is it you , mordaunt ? '' <EOS>	54.09995883130769
<SOS> said cromwell , the cloud passing away from his face ; `` since you are here , it is well ; you may remain . '' <EOS>	109.18836879302947
<SOS> `` i come to congratulate you . '' <EOS>	85.95498355355934

<SOS> `` i was much more really so two hours ago . '' <EOS>	81.49442210984454
<SOS> `` how so , general ? '' <EOS>	60.7244197699133
<SOS> `` because england had need of me to take the tyrant , and now the tyrant is taken . <EOS>	88.8527149907756

<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	64.76479769799826
<SOS> said mordaunt . <EOS>	74.55508108882687
<SOS> `` what is his bearing ? '' <EOS>	55.72221486123429
<SOS> mordaunt hesitated ; but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth . <EOS>	116.9896895827253
<SOS> `` calm and dignified , '' said he . <EOS>	84.0619768096836
<SOS> `` what did he say ? '' <EOS>	98.41736608867522
<SOS> `` some parting words to his friends . '' <EOS>	95.92237682387767
<SOS> `` his friends ! '' <EOS>	89.14186447106358
<SOS> murmured cromwell . <EOS>	53.55954523502178
<SOS> `` has he any friends ? '' <EOS>	70.12297201522604
<SOS> then he added aloud , `` did he make any resistance ? '' <EOS>	56.09767831903964
<SOS> `` no , sir , with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him ; he had no means of resistance . '' <EOS>	65.26806692694842
<SOS> `` to whom did he give up his sword ? '' <EOS>	104.59046613507256
<SOS> `` he did not give it up ; he broke it . '' <EOS>	47.697966779140884
<SOS> `` he did well ; but instead of breaking it , he might have used it to still more advantage . '' <EOS>	73.88342864079185
<SOS> there was a momentary pause . <EOS>	80.12210814658992
<SOS> `` i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed , '' said cromwell , staring very fixedly at mordaunt . <EOS>	51.68795855548071
<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	56.92175240514976
<SOS> `` by whom ? '' <EOS>	69.39055622396914
<SOS> inquired cromwell . <EOS>	80.40734715927935
<SOS> `` by me . '' <EOS>	76.04581444284375
<SOS> `` what was his name ? '' <EOS>	102.42606020458228

<SOS> `` your uncle ? '' <EOS>	70.21605616851161
<SOS> exclaimed cromwell . <EOS>	61.59815920243946
<SOS> `` my uncle , '' answered mordaunt ; `` but traitors to england are no longer members of my family . '' <EOS>	49.38043309475837
<SOS> cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence , then , with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well : `` mordaunt , '' he said , `` you are a terrible servant . '' <EOS>	70.90498180514163
<SOS> `` when the lord commands , '' said mordaunt , `` his commands are not to be disputed . <EOS>	104.20299419836185
<SOS> abraham raised the knife against isaac , and isaac was his son . '' <EOS>	98.93625335020464
<SOS> `` yes , '' said cromwell , `` but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished . '' <EOS>	71.2796256877294
<SOS> `` i have looked around me , '' said mordaunt , `` and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain . '' <EOS>	74.40602106314846
<SOS> cromwell bowed . <EOS>	94.23166836965268
<SOS> `` you are strong among the strong , mordaunt , '' he said ; `` and the frenchmen , how did they behave ? '' <EOS>	66.4066484877826
<SOS> `` most fearlessly . '' <EOS>	106.35379985563057
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' murmured cromwell ; `` the french fight well ; and if my glass was good and i mistake not , they were foremost in the fight . '' <EOS>	48.62019596772422
<SOS> `` they were , '' replied mordaunt . <EOS>	58.26996897303231

<SOS> `` and the scotch ? '' <EOS>	80.64081110846024
<SOS> `` they kept their word and never stirred , '' said mordaunt . <EOS>	59.95979850475496
<SOS> `` wretched men ! '' <EOS>	56.385467725058746
<SOS> `` their officers wish to see you , sir . '' <EOS>	97.18049048311049

<SOS> `` a favor from me ? '' <EOS>	83.07818330366699
<SOS> mordaunt bowed . <EOS>	83.07017025368287
<SOS> `` i come to you , my leader , my head , my father , and i ask you , master , are you contented with me ? '' <EOS>	105.07777575897731
<SOS> cromwell looked at him with astonishment . <EOS>	70.78580356798591
<SOS> the young man remained immovable . <EOS>	111.50678052795202
<SOS> `` yes , '' said cromwell ; `` you have done , since i knew you , not only your duty , but more than your duty ; you have been a faithful friend , a cautious negotiator , a brave soldier . '' <EOS>	61.82909358178763

<SOS> `` yes , the idea was yours . <EOS>	50.85591128196186

<SOS> `` too ardently , perhaps ; it is what i have just reproached you for . <EOS>	72.44882856455166

<SOS> `` what is it ? <EOS>	42.11028110401429

<SOS> `` on the contrary , i think they are poor , sir . '' <EOS>	82.05379027796214

<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' exclaimed mordaunt , `` they are friends , dear friends of mine , and i would lay down my life for them . '' <EOS>	77.59325606437511
<SOS> `` very well , mordaunt , '' exclaimed cromwell , pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more ; `` i will give them to you ; i will not even ask who they are ; do as you like with them . '' <EOS>	82.1155490940795
<SOS> `` thank you , sir ! '' <EOS>	75.98458392537606
<SOS> exclaimed mordaunt , `` thank you ; my life is always at your service , and should i lose it i should still owe you something ; thank you ; you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services . '' <EOS>	60.48870818667195
<SOS> he threw himself at the feet of cromwell , and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general , who did not like this almost kingly homage , he took his hand and kissed it . <EOS>	68.11552106355148
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	70.78120410391631
<SOS> said cromwell , arresting him for a moment as he arose ; `` is there nothing more you wish ? <EOS>	94.28487662325207

<SOS> `` you have given me all you can give me , and from to day your debt is paid . '' <EOS>	42.16677519919381
<SOS> and mordaunt darted out of the general 's tent , his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy . <EOS>	86.17432883936243
<SOS> cromwell gazed a moment after him . <EOS>	65.90367744969514
<SOS> `` he has slain his uncle ! '' <EOS>	70.03651881227104
<SOS> he murmured . <EOS>	68.07749609991033
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	68.13044832183137
<SOS> what are my servants ? <EOS>	68.70616651380212
<SOS> possibly this one , who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing , has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor . <EOS>	55.53900488479018

<SOS> charles , who is my prisoner , may still have friends , but i have none ! '' <EOS>	81.71391240959193
<SOS> and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt . <EOS>	83.96201883736401

<SOS> jesus seigneur . <EOS>	57.62545293661909
<SOS> whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell 's tent , d'artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle . <EOS>	61.489087317685026
<SOS> the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by d'artagnan , who accordingly , by an expressive glance , warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution . <EOS>	70.00290722069491
<SOS> the prisoners , therefore , had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts . <EOS>	87.2597384794796
<SOS> it would be impossible to describe mousqueton 's astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching , followed by a sergeant with a dozen men . <EOS>	62.9833562891947
<SOS> he rubbed his eyes , doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis ; and forced at last to yield to evidence , he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos , the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute . <EOS>	71.28832642744966
<SOS> mousqueton remained glued to the door , awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence . <EOS>	51.26434332615986
<SOS> what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another . <EOS>	53.75509404515993
<SOS> the house to which d'artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening . <EOS>	93.25445218712649
<SOS> it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear , bordering on the side street , stables and a sort of garden . <EOS>	115.86674808975121
<SOS> the windows on the ground floor , according to a custom in provincial villages , were barred , so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison . <EOS>	94.82692252324941
<SOS> the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first , whilst they stood at the door , desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable . <EOS>	68.29574744646449
<SOS> `` why do n't we go in with them ? '' <EOS>	48.16788925686309
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	47.287254819221666
<SOS> `` we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	93.4364976726862
<SOS> the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden . <EOS>	79.60188000857134
<SOS> d'artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position . <EOS>	94.37902347747534
<SOS> `` we have had orders , '' answered the man , `` to help you in taking care of your prisoners . '' <EOS>	66.95274613590303
<SOS> there could be no fault to find with this arrangement ; on the contrary , it seemed to be a delicate attention , to be gratefully received ; d'artagnan , therefore , thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwell 's health . <EOS>	44.355405243061966
<SOS> the sergeant answered that puritans never drank , and put the crown piece in his pocket . <EOS>	61.726397945664836
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	93.4765474048027
<SOS> said porthos , `` what a fearful day , my dear d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	65.15875210999823
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	122.45650112400104

<SOS> `` yes ; but under what circumstances ? '' <EOS>	59.03007725717795
<SOS> `` 't is true that our position is an awkward one ; but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done . '' <EOS>	74.84256705183749
<SOS> `` things look black enough , '' replied porthos ; `` i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt . '' <EOS>	46.8893148183803
<SOS> `` silence ! '' <EOS>	86.2307619948964
<SOS> cried the gascon ; `` do not utter that name . '' <EOS>	88.9652456732553
<SOS> `` but , '' argued porthos , `` i speak french and they are all english . '' <EOS>	82.67804593046098
<SOS> d'artagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity . <EOS>	76.45250082276254
<SOS> but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment , he merely pushed him indoors , saying , `` let us go in . '' <EOS>	85.90480173083981
<SOS> they found athos in profound despondency ; aramis looked first at porthos and then at d'artagnan , without speaking , but the latter understood his meaningful look . <EOS>	76.96218038495091
<SOS> `` you want to know how we came here ? <EOS>	77.59899782289742

<SOS> `` that most sacred in the world , '' said athos ; `` the cause of misfortune , of religion , royalty . <EOS>	63.79241752818909

<SOS> `` heyday ! '' <EOS>	58.49247387683278
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` what matters it to me , after all , if cromwell , who 's an englishman , revolts against his king , who is a scotchman ? <EOS>	76.69054312293794

<SOS> and you , you , d'artagnan , a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france , bearing an honorable name , carrying a good sword , have helped to give up a king to beersellers , shopkeepers , and wagoners . <EOS>	75.14956351153951
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	82.10616873887108
<SOS> d'artagnan ! <EOS>	99.7404934927695
<SOS> perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier , but as a gentleman , i say that you are very culpable . '' <EOS>	96.18676167603896
<SOS> d'artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower , unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable ; for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis . <EOS>	110.57049749734038
<SOS> `` and you , porthos , '' continued the count , as if in consideration for d'artagnan 's embarrassment , `` you , the best heart , the best friend , the best soldier that i know you , with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne , and who , sooner or later , must receive your reward from an intelligent king you , my dear porthos , you , a gentleman in manners , in tastes and in courage , you are as culpable as d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	70.34256048270358
<SOS> porthos blushed , but with pleasure rather than with confusion ; and yet , bowing his head , as if humiliated , he said : `` yes , yes , my dear count , i feel that you are right . '' <EOS>	88.20428793635507
<SOS> athos arose . <EOS>	84.21388078998802
<SOS> `` come , '' he said , stretching out his hand to d'artagnan , `` come , do n't be sullen , my dear son , for i have said all this to you , if not in the tone , at least with the feelings of a father . <EOS>	52.60784167436944
<SOS> it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this . '' <EOS>	65.64078737831635
<SOS> `` doubtless , doubtless , athos . <EOS>	70.77494521660866

<SOS> who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house , france , his ward a charming youth , for we saw him in the camp to fly to the aid of a rotten , worm eaten royalty , which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel . <EOS>	80.72205821742664
<SOS> the sentiments you air are certainly fine , so fine that they are superhuman . '' <EOS>	118.3607307469249
<SOS> `` however that may be , d'artagnan , '' replied athos , without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love , `` however that may be , you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true ; but i am wrong to dispute with my master . <EOS>	103.51634671757023

<SOS> `` no , '' said aramis , `` they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts . '' <EOS>	101.67990271566013
<SOS> `` and how were they treated ? '' <EOS>	82.48257411689094
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	120.48499613954364
<SOS> `` why , '' said aramis , `` one half were hanged and the other half were shot . '' <EOS>	111.12264902819868

<SOS> `` well , you can go out by that door whenever you please ; for from this moment you are free as the air . '' <EOS>	67.8499567167903
<SOS> `` i recognize you there , my brave d'artagnan , '' replied athos ; `` but you are no longer our masters . <EOS>	74.82864514385237
<SOS> that door is guarded , d'artagnan ; you know that . '' <EOS>	86.330834890722
<SOS> `` very well , you will force it , '' said porthos . <EOS>	105.0163464290221

<SOS> see the fatal example : on the vendomois road , d'artagnan , you so brave , and you , porthos , so valiant and so strong you were beaten ; to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn . <EOS>	88.83212939205012
<SOS> now that never happened to us when we were four together . <EOS>	60.236693850383766

<SOS> `` i know it and i have nothing more to say ; my arguments lead to nothing ; doubtless they are bad , since they have not determined minds so just as yours . '' <EOS>	106.82258360282063
<SOS> `` besides , '' said aramis , `` had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	45.84243580012578

<SOS> d'artagnan said nothing , but , after having gnawed the flower stalk , he began to bite his nails . <EOS>	68.24060935325238
<SOS> at last : `` do you imagine , '' he resumed , `` that they mean to kill you ? <EOS>	60.05265268853184
<SOS> and wherefore should they do so ? <EOS>	88.83999407539693

<SOS> `` fool ! '' <EOS>	84.3800579643461

<SOS> `` the truth is , i 'm very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me , '' said porthos . <EOS>	59.85151875123435
<SOS> `` eh ! <EOS>	83.92939090590828

<SOS> `` cap de diou ! <EOS>	51.724327869231125

<SOS> it is useless ; for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years , ago you , athos , in the rue ferou , and you , aramis , in the rue de vaugirard . '' <EOS>	84.97059343022582
<SOS> `` stop , '' cried athos , extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted ; `` you will soon know what to expect , for here he is . '' <EOS>	99.79383564751384
<SOS> `` who ? '' <EOS>	101.79424887896404
<SOS> `` mordaunt . '' <EOS>	60.02049664083107
<SOS> in fact , looking at the place to which athos pointed , d'artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop . <EOS>	48.118867450401474
<SOS> it was mordaunt . <EOS>	107.1111741234264
<SOS> d'artagnan rushed out of the room . <EOS>	90.2194923895088
<SOS> porthos wanted to follow him . <EOS>	50.00917059473303
<SOS> `` stay , '' said d'artagnan , `` and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door . '' <EOS>	73.5900971291893
<SOS> when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d'artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there , with their arms . <EOS>	79.85639536711406
<SOS> `` halloo ! '' <EOS>	63.306460868895854
<SOS> he cried , `` are the prisoners still there ? '' <EOS>	57.74668720141588
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' answered the sergeant , uncovering . <EOS>	57.65452086575194
<SOS> `` 't is well ; order four men to conduct them to my lodging . '' <EOS>	63.36162177292821
<SOS> four men prepared to do so . <EOS>	64.29859236511473
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	106.37859780226576
<SOS> said d'artagnan , with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance . <EOS>	63.07254373698015
<SOS> `` what is the matter , if you please ? '' <EOS>	44.58807270371044
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied mordaunt , `` i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging . '' <EOS>	91.38968307600666
<SOS> `` wherefore , sir ? <EOS>	88.18777961285225
<SOS> excuse curiosity , but i wish to be enlightened on the subject . '' <EOS>	85.22428227924313
<SOS> `` because these prisoners , sir , are at my disposal and i choose to dispose of them as i like . '' <EOS>	83.57290445032326
<SOS> `` allow me allow me , sir , '' said d'artagnan , `` to observe you are in error . <EOS>	59.90280986645862
<SOS> the prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken . <EOS>	92.9951585877371
<SOS> you might have taken lord winter who , 't is said , was your uncle prisoner , but you preferred killing him ; 't is well ; we , that is , monsieur du vallon and i , could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them . '' <EOS>	54.25823014417467
<SOS> mordaunt 's very lips grew white with rage . <EOS>	97.91213017581796
<SOS> d'artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard 's march upon the door . <EOS>	78.1317955332083
<SOS> at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door . <EOS>	64.72121762584347
<SOS> this movement was observed by mordaunt . <EOS>	109.13703941236751
<SOS> `` sir ! '' <EOS>	67.5281370998411
<SOS> he thus addressed d'artagnan , `` your resistance is useless ; these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron , oliver cromwell . '' <EOS>	78.08508442439494
<SOS> these words struck d'artagnan like a thunderbolt . <EOS>	104.10546311779237
<SOS> the blood mounted to his temples , his eyes became dim ; he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose , and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword . <EOS>	85.16805808687279
<SOS> as for porthos , he looked inquiringly at d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.32683896405796
<SOS> this look of porthos 's made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning . <EOS>	76.07869030993884
<SOS> `` violence , '' he said to himself , `` would spoil all ; d'artagnan , my friend , prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger , but more subtle than he is . '' <EOS>	72.14265130460359
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	62.7569801433798
<SOS> he said , making a low bow , `` why did you not begin by saying that , monsieur mordaunt ? <EOS>	48.08486481311969
<SOS> what ! <EOS>	80.20912178556718
<SOS> are you sent by general oliver cromwell , the most illustrious captain of the age ? '' <EOS>	79.27622939514482
<SOS> `` i have this instant left him , '' replied mordaunt , alighting , in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold . <EOS>	105.92605076268296
<SOS> `` why did you not say so at once , my dear sir ! <EOS>	65.3225380207056
<SOS> all england is with cromwell ; and since you ask for my prisoners , i bend , sir , to your wishes . <EOS>	86.69901480402473
<SOS> they are yours ; take them . '' <EOS>	66.33120149935316
<SOS> mordaunt , delighted , advanced , porthos looking at d'artagnan with open mouthed astonishment . <EOS>	96.63446694358609
<SOS> then d'artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting . <EOS>	47.65804113844994
<SOS> mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and , with his hat in hand , prepared to pass by the two friends , motioning to the four men to follow him . <EOS>	53.16070905325469
<SOS> `` but , pardon , '' said d'artagnan , with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man 's shoulder , `` if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour , he has , of course , made that act of donation in writing . '' <EOS>	75.35363277099664
<SOS> mordaunt stopped short . <EOS>	113.24294383869258
<SOS> `` he has given you some little writing for me the least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name . <EOS>	52.65547851025524
<SOS> be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that i may justify , by a pretext at least , my abandoning my countrymen . <EOS>	87.12495784089921
<SOS> otherwise , you see , although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm , it would have a bad appearance . '' <EOS>	41.59813533541307
<SOS> mordaunt recoiled ; he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at d'artagnan , who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance . <EOS>	78.48615609455383
<SOS> `` when i tell you a thing , sir , '' said mordaunt , `` you insult me by doubting it . '' <EOS>	78.04194642905841
<SOS> `` i ! '' <EOS>	74.96722109904883
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` i doubt what you say ! <EOS>	76.12395963283441
<SOS> god keep me from it , my dear monsieur mordaunt ! <EOS>	77.10412719552019
<SOS> on the contrary , i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman . <EOS>	40.74368006001927
<SOS> and then , sir , do you wish me to speak freely to you ? '' <EOS>	76.92497242866187
<SOS> continued d'artagnan , with his frank expression . <EOS>	59.61794138277962
<SOS> `` speak out , sir , '' said mordaunt . <EOS>	75.45136891683073
<SOS> `` monsieur du vallon , yonder , is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly , so he does not care about money . <EOS>	48.73575297949638
<SOS> i do not speak for him , but for myself . '' <EOS>	48.07955484496645
<SOS> `` well , sir ? <EOS>	73.28741267148358
<SOS> what more ? '' <EOS>	90.57993738922228
<SOS> `` well i i 'm not rich . <EOS>	86.30113162577675
<SOS> in gascony 't is no dishonor , sir , nobody is rich ; and henry iv. , of glorious memory , who was the king of the gascons , as his majesty philip iv . <EOS>	69.98817989917752
<SOS> is the king of the spaniards , never had a penny in his pocket . '' <EOS>	91.09850057663657
<SOS> `` go on , sir , i see what you wish to get at ; and if it is simply what i think that stops you , i can obviate the difficulty . '' <EOS>	59.223790260280154
<SOS> `` ah , i knew well , '' said the gascon , `` that you were a man of talent . <EOS>	106.10431826224095

<SOS> i am an officer of fortune , nothing else ; i have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say , more blows than banknotes . <EOS>	57.97166926503382
<SOS> now , on taking prisoners , this morning , two frenchmen , who seemed to me of high birth in short , two knights of the garter i said to myself , my fortune is made . <EOS>	41.83709788033844
<SOS> i say two , because in such circumstances , monsieur du vallon , who is rich , always gives me his prisoners . '' <EOS>	79.24471602929036
<SOS> mordaunt , completely deceived by the wordy civility of d'artagnan , smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him , and said : `` i shall have the order signed directly , sir , and with it two thousand pistoles ; meanwhile , let me take these men away . '' <EOS>	102.97925988454503
<SOS> `` no , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` what signifies a delay of half an hour ? <EOS>	109.16575332743353

<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us . <EOS>	81.98446970291907
<SOS> we are gentlemen ; we are , both of us , able to kill you and your eight men we two only . <EOS>	92.50458246489242
<SOS> for heaven 's sake do n't be obstinate , for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise , and then i become ferocious and headstrong , and there 's my friend , who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself . <EOS>	95.36491419316512
<SOS> besides , we are sent here by cardinal mazarin , and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal , and are , therefore , as ambassadors , able to act with impunity , a thing that general oliver cromwell , who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general , is quite the man to understand . <EOS>	84.12908850149535
<SOS> ask him then , for the written order . <EOS>	70.61312407812818
<SOS> what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt ? '' <EOS>	77.04687293178631
<SOS> `` yes , the written order , '' said porthos , who now began to comprehend what d'artagnan was aiming at , `` we ask only for that . '' <EOS>	114.96228399414606
<SOS> however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence , he understood the reasons d'artagnan had given him ; besides , completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen , all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom . <EOS>	80.67679691256906
<SOS> he decided , therefore , not only to fetch the order , but the two thousand pistoles , at which he estimated the prisoners . <EOS>	79.42760466755648
<SOS> he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared . <EOS>	64.52211720147508
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	110.5653900257094
<SOS> thought d'artagnan ; `` a quarter of an hour to go to the tent , a quarter of an hour to return ; it is more than we need . '' <EOS>	102.06913406616384
<SOS> then turning , without the least change of countenance , to porthos , he said , looking him full in the face : `` friend porthos , listen to this ; first , not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard ; it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them . '' <EOS>	71.33578915639434
<SOS> `` very well ; i understand . '' <EOS>	69.16015302813805
<SOS> `` go to the stable ; you will find mousqueton there ; saddle your horses , put your pistols in your saddle bags , take out the horses and lead them to the street below this , so that there will be nothing to do but mount them ; all the rest is my business . '' <EOS>	57.206583241130346
<SOS> porthos made no remark , but obeyed , with the sublime confidence he had in his friend . <EOS>	54.893064136796376
<SOS> `` i go , '' he said , `` only , shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are ? '' <EOS>	90.37287979117477
<SOS> `` no , it is not worth while . '' <EOS>	98.5779646694431
<SOS> `` well , do me the kindness to take my purse , which i left on the mantelpiece . '' <EOS>	47.00109894990277
<SOS> `` all right . '' <EOS>	119.29184979217833
<SOS> he then proceeded , with his usual calm gait , to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery , who , foreigner as he was , could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs . <EOS>	80.09296712442058
<SOS> at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him . <EOS>	89.79382001161429
<SOS> d'artagnan , meantime , went into the house , whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away . <EOS>	45.33261501549081
<SOS> `` my dear athos , i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced . <EOS>	70.12787727037087
<SOS> i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter . <EOS>	77.72571611079556
<SOS> as you say , mazarin is a knave . <EOS>	90.44451201811476
<SOS> i have resolved to fly with you , not a word be ready . <EOS>	75.25112136474847
<SOS> your swords are in the corner ; do not forget them , they are in many circumstances very useful ; there is porthos 's purse , too . '' <EOS>	67.64718571934431
<SOS> he put it into his pocket . <EOS>	81.5167585106818
<SOS> the two friends were perfectly stupefied . <EOS>	65.10036314074961
<SOS> `` well , pray , is there anything to be so surprised at ? '' <EOS>	60.566143613167185
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	79.98426795835849
<SOS> `` i was blind ; athos has made me see , that 's all ; come here . '' <EOS>	80.45416238307043
<SOS> the two friends went near him . <EOS>	104.73298891919244
<SOS> `` do you see that street ? <EOS>	88.84780244554992
<SOS> there are the horses . <EOS>	59.30816637095416
<SOS> go out by the door , turn to the right , jump into your saddles , all will be right ; do n't be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal . <EOS>	85.05320703925605
<SOS> that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur ! '' <EOS>	82.28564254069882
<SOS> `` but give us your word that you will come too , d'artagnan , '' said athos . <EOS>	58.86312622317361
<SOS> `` i swear i will , by heaven . '' <EOS>	108.4857536010833
<SOS> `` 't is settled , '' said aramis ; `` at the cry 'jesus seigneur ' we go out , upset all that stands in our way , run to our horses , jump into our saddles , spur them ; is that all ? '' <EOS>	45.37705002506666
<SOS> `` exactly . '' <EOS>	89.77438951164704
<SOS> `` see , aramis , as i have told you , d'artagnan is first amongst us all , '' said athos . <EOS>	75.48133246043433
<SOS> `` very true , '' replied the gascon , `` but i always run away from compliments . <EOS>	85.40119736964793
<SOS> do n't forget the signal : 'jesus seigneur ! ' '' <EOS>	89.64628440507467
<SOS> and he went out as he came in , whistling the self same air . <EOS>	48.50232946734363
<SOS> the soldiers were playing or sleeping ; two of them were singing in a corner , out of tune , the psalm : `` on the rivers of babylon . '' <EOS>	80.86193721580209
<SOS> d'artagnan called the sergeant . <EOS>	60.625250976884935
<SOS> `` my dear friend , general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me . <EOS>	91.91660764563497
<SOS> guard the prisoners well , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	57.0562008583021
<SOS> the sergeant made a sign , as much as to say he did not understand french , and d'artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures . <EOS>	103.64418077317133
<SOS> then he went into the stable ; he found the five horses saddled , his own amongst the rest . <EOS>	98.06380685828726
<SOS> `` each of you take a horse by the bridle , '' he said to porthos and mousqueton ; `` turn to the left , so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window . '' <EOS>	56.62629544406394
<SOS> `` they are coming , then ? '' <EOS>	71.09512445196604
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	66.10951264448822
<SOS> `` in a moment . '' <EOS>	98.63261582069323
<SOS> `` you did n't forget my purse ? '' <EOS>	67.28767520719848
<SOS> `` no ; be easy . '' <EOS>	59.13757814233389
<SOS> `` good . '' <EOS>	105.64952289047268
<SOS> porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post . <EOS>	66.42695910276349
<SOS> then d'artagnan , being alone , struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder , mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers . <EOS>	62.123031593164335
<SOS> there , caressing as he pretended , the animal with his hand , he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear . <EOS>	93.65270808450077
<SOS> it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme , for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad . <EOS>	75.30188727791585
<SOS> the soldiers , whom he was nearly trampling , ran away . <EOS>	103.43069477777001
<SOS> `` help ! <EOS>	72.73973319046482
<SOS> help ! '' <EOS>	64.92346548893028
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` stop my horse has the staggers . '' <EOS>	87.02172962711154
<SOS> in an instant the horse 's eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam . <EOS>	70.96591716305736
<SOS> `` help ! '' <EOS>	107.6489834805434
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.05425484290512
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	87.84111144475271
<SOS> will you let me be killed ? <EOS>	70.06005628040162
<SOS> jesus seigneur ! '' <EOS>	87.32465705136342
<SOS> no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out . <EOS>	57.52863518363192
<SOS> the coast , owing to the gascon 's stratagem , was clear . <EOS>	56.53540456892741
<SOS> `` the prisoners are escaping ! <EOS>	70.24849546552394
<SOS> the prisoners are escaping ! '' <EOS>	56.184730663148315
<SOS> cried the sergeant . <EOS>	105.76588982177464
<SOS> `` stop ! <EOS>	88.10878488612776
<SOS> stop ! '' <EOS>	90.70636039472684
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , giving rein to his famous steed , who , darting forth , overturned several men . <EOS>	89.95294484582186
<SOS> `` stop ! <EOS>	97.15251421408678
<SOS> stop ! '' <EOS>	100.09957695342985
<SOS> cried the soldiers , and ran for their arms . <EOS>	97.78541766195292
<SOS> but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate . <EOS>	93.50011959963749
<SOS> in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois , who were coming to find their masters . <EOS>	114.18008822715177
<SOS> with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud , who followed the little troop , understand everything , and they passed on like a whirlwind , d'artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice . <EOS>	69.96876555380808
<SOS> they passed through the gate like apparitions , without the guards thinking of detaining them , and reached the open country . <EOS>	87.78574205498221
<SOS> all this time the soldiers were calling out , `` stop ! <EOS>	85.14814687759993
<SOS> stop ! '' <EOS>	96.83577929061407
<SOS> and the sergeant , who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice , was almost in a frenzy of despair . <EOS>	69.40012680758626
<SOS> whilst all this was going on , a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching . <EOS>	46.60728833724262
<SOS> it was mordaunt with the order in his hand . <EOS>	93.70896809089332
<SOS> `` the prisoners ! '' <EOS>	53.11621768893316
<SOS> he exclaimed , jumping off his horse . <EOS>	88.68649051823004
<SOS> the sergeant had not the courage to reply ; he showed him the open door , the empty room . <EOS>	69.8529857189639
<SOS> mordaunt darted to the steps , understood all , uttered a cry , as if his very heart was pierced , and fell fainting on the stone steps . <EOS>	68.08346387245808
<SOS> chapter lix . <EOS>	78.1320664743934
<SOS> noble natures never lose courage , nor good stomachs their appetites . <EOS>	64.39455720955242
<SOS> the little troop , without looking behind them or exchanging a word , fled at a rapid gallop , fording a little stream , of which none of them knew the name , and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham . <EOS>	47.057792771040816
<SOS> at last they came in sight of a small wood , and spurring their horses afresh , rode in its direction . <EOS>	65.71573121781209
<SOS> as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together . <EOS>	46.67607277267774
<SOS> the two grooms held the horses , that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled , and grimaud was posted as sentinel . <EOS>	60.41813319789217
<SOS> `` come , first of all , '' said athos to d'artagnan , `` my friend , that i may shake hands with you you , our rescuer you , the true hero of us all . '' <EOS>	55.22635422786381
<SOS> `` athos is right you have my adoration , '' said aramis , in his turn pressing his hand . <EOS>	72.30242997498718
<SOS> `` to what are you not equal , with your superior intelligence , infallible eye , your arm of iron and your enterprising mind ! '' <EOS>	64.50974434652451
<SOS> `` now , '' said the gascon , `` that is all well , i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments ; we have plenty of time to spare . '' <EOS>	95.1797196618789
<SOS> the two friends , recalled by d'artagnan to what was also due to porthos , pressed his hand in their turn . <EOS>	77.03797208450446
<SOS> `` and now , '' said athos , `` it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen , but we must map up our campaign . <EOS>	114.01086277493012
<SOS> what shall we do ? '' <EOS>	62.59989018582668
<SOS> `` what are we going to do , i'faith ? <EOS>	119.10397350597333
<SOS> it is not very difficult to say . '' <EOS>	64.06218203550539
<SOS> `` tell us , then , d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	75.41111569975473
<SOS> `` we are going to reach the nearest seaport , unite our little resources , hire a vessel and return to france . <EOS>	83.12461282446571
<SOS> as for me i will give my last sou for it . <EOS>	114.7488695981177
<SOS> life is the greatest treasure , and speaking candidly , ours hangs by a thread . '' <EOS>	73.4578499674187
<SOS> `` what do you say to this , du vallon ? '' <EOS>	70.839911439388
<SOS> `` i , '' said porthos , `` i am entirely of d'artagnan 's opinion ; this is a 'beastly ' country , this england . '' <EOS>	89.27668530278937
<SOS> `` you are quite decided , then , to leave it ? '' <EOS>	45.42327579551337
<SOS> asked athos of d'artagnan . <EOS>	57.333580242743764
<SOS> `` egad ! <EOS>	76.70522483541616
<SOS> i do n't see what is to keep me here . '' <EOS>	86.78874836793449
<SOS> a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis . <EOS>	109.12188344268841
<SOS> `` go , then , my friends , '' said the former , sighing . <EOS>	121.51439977771138
<SOS> `` how , go then ? '' <EOS>	88.76358242044246
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan . <EOS>	60.66361191302351
<SOS> `` let us go , you mean ? '' <EOS>	92.77364841667016
<SOS> `` no , my friend , '' said athos , `` you must leave us . '' <EOS>	52.55727803232959
<SOS> `` leave you ! '' <EOS>	70.61223754897667
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement . <EOS>	44.17764905177064
<SOS> `` bah ! '' <EOS>	98.82794996495218
<SOS> said porthos , `` why separate , since we are all together ? '' <EOS>	93.68286845397623
<SOS> `` because you can and ought to return to france ; your mission is accomplished , but ours is not . '' <EOS>	41.075499077262585
<SOS> `` your mission is not accomplished ? '' <EOS>	87.2769830692191
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , looking in astonishment at athos . <EOS>	64.36239100538326
<SOS> `` no , my friend , '' replied athos , in his gentle but decided voice , `` we came here to defend king charles ; we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him ! '' <EOS>	92.96591469634593
<SOS> `` to save the king ? '' <EOS>	55.90866888723396
<SOS> said d'artagnan , looking at aramis as he had looked at athos . <EOS>	90.79152422661302
<SOS> aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head . <EOS>	58.62138860131855
<SOS> d'artagnan 's countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion ; he began to think he had to do with madmen . <EOS>	99.97488793510391
<SOS> `` you can not be speaking seriously , athos ! '' <EOS>	78.62890824453555
<SOS> said he ; `` the king is surrounded by an army , which is conducting him to london . <EOS>	64.77276850477541
<SOS> this army is commanded by a butcher , or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison . <EOS>	62.650476205539704
<SOS> his majesty , i can assure you , will be tried on his arrival in london ; i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect . '' <EOS>	83.8749065823342
<SOS> a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis . <EOS>	79.21224012979998
<SOS> `` and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution , '' continued d'artagnan . <EOS>	61.84279112227003
<SOS> `` and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned ? '' <EOS>	102.63099608778445
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	70.88902665334885
<SOS> `` the penalty of death , i greatly fear ; they have gone too far for him to pardon them , and there is nothing left to them but one thing , and that is to kill him . <EOS>	80.82686620861834
<SOS> have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned ? '' <EOS>	57.11817516461932
<SOS> `` what did he say ? '' <EOS>	70.45763717258099
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	90.26724563583063
<SOS> `` 'princes must be knocked on the head . ' '' <EOS>	54.36279923595741
<SOS> `` i remember it , '' said athos . <EOS>	105.48564697759917
<SOS> `` and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution , now that he has got hold of the king ? '' <EOS>	101.60989914684002
<SOS> `` on the contrary , i am certain he will do so . <EOS>	81.2951480495679
<SOS> but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened . '' <EOS>	101.31558161397393
<SOS> `` athos , you are becoming mad . '' <EOS>	65.5302667319263
<SOS> `` no , my friend , '' athos gently replied , `` but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us , monsieur d'herblay and myself , to madame henrietta . <EOS>	69.01862087557154

<SOS> we engaged our word ; our word included everything . <EOS>	54.999980635338844

<SOS> it remains now for us to keep our word . <EOS>	73.00057011014057
<SOS> is that your opinion , d'herblay ? '' <EOS>	51.263672247002575
<SOS> `` yes , '' said aramis , `` we have promised . '' <EOS>	53.89699275691946
<SOS> `` then , '' continued athos , `` we have another reason ; it is this listen : in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry . <EOS>	44.26003946510944
<SOS> we have a king ten years old , who does n't yet know what he wants ; we have a queen blinded by a belated passion ; we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say , intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention ; we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition , who will draw from mazarin 's hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes . <EOS>	71.39037864178358
<SOS> i have served them without enthusiasm god knows that i estimated them at their real value , and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle . <EOS>	106.0280752885684

<SOS> i have encountered misfortune in a high place , a royal misfortune , a european misfortune ; i attach myself to it . <EOS>	42.802388900672554
<SOS> if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good ; if we die for him it will be grand . '' <EOS>	44.53916092637253
<SOS> `` so you know beforehand you must perish ! '' <EOS>	105.1484377257895

<SOS> in heaven 's name , my dear athos , do not make a useless sacrifice . <EOS>	40.166228764863526
<SOS> when i see you merely , you look like a reasonable being ; when you speak , i seem to have to do with a madman . <EOS>	75.19365767485009
<SOS> come , porthos , join me ; say frankly , what do you think of this business ? '' <EOS>	102.41925203060995
<SOS> `` nothing good , '' replied porthos . <EOS>	51.78039266870565
<SOS> `` come , '' continued d'artagnan , who , irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts , `` you have never found yourself the worse for my advice . <EOS>	80.71357796825465
<SOS> well , then , believe me , athos , your mission is ended , and ended nobly ; return to france with us . '' <EOS>	57.068745043871516
<SOS> `` friend , '' said athos , `` our resolution is irrevocable . '' <EOS>	86.31682395994493
<SOS> `` then you have some other motive unknown to us ? '' <EOS>	76.44063986658865
<SOS> athos smiled and d'artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover ; but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm , sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head . <EOS>	63.27170197353363
<SOS> `` very well , '' cried d'artagnan , at last , furious , `` very well , since you wish it , let us leave our bones in this beggarly land , where it is always cold , where fine weather is a fog , fog is rain , and rain a deluge ; where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese ; in truth , whether we die here or elsewhere matters little , since we must die .

<SOS> `` oh , it will happen , you may be sure , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.71521523785319
<SOS> `` so it is agreed , and if porthos makes no objection `` `` i , '' said porthos , `` i will do whatever you please ; and besides , i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good . '' <EOS>	59.03529712545436

<SOS> `` need we think of that since we are to save the king ? <EOS>	53.80671721708778
<SOS> the king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the puritans reconquer england ; we shall re enter london place him securely on his throne `` `` and he will make us dukes and peers , '' said porthos , whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect . <EOS>	56.70018041440241

<SOS> `` well , that has happened , friend porthos . <EOS>	61.07128048418848

<SOS> said athos , offering his hand to d'artagnan . <EOS>	113.14063660155678

<SOS> `` and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes , '' said porthos , smacking his lips . <EOS>	80.38591668924066

<SOS> cried aramis . <EOS>	116.48456010887149
<SOS> and the four friends , guided by mousqueton , took up the way toward the house , already almost restored to their former gayety ; for they were now , as athos had said , all four once more united and of single mind . <EOS>	88.00157367460967

<SOS> as our fugitives approached the house , they found the ground cut up , as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them . <EOS>	90.50103093149036
<SOS> before the door the traces were yet more apparent ; these horsemen , whoever they might be , had halted there . <EOS>	49.64679994433527

<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` they will have left a chicken , at least . '' <EOS>	91.46169814026054
<SOS> he dismounted and knocked on the door . <EOS>	75.91428575876178
<SOS> there was no response . <EOS>	82.75053521499052
<SOS> he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted . <EOS>	47.12823613041613
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	49.811204553522934
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	67.8079326361913
<SOS> `` i can see nobody , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	68.7627209498733
<SOS> `` aha ! '' <EOS>	86.62170874546023
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	54.2940284375505

<SOS> at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered . <EOS>	93.02581201523338
<SOS> d'artagnan had already opened the door of the second room , and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object . <EOS>	45.46664272640527
<SOS> the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground , bathed in a pool of blood . <EOS>	56.6668485145049
<SOS> it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed , but had not had sufficient strength to do so . <EOS>	86.58591828675473
<SOS> athos , who imagined that he saw him move , was the first to go up to him . <EOS>	90.37332559084099
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	61.94450325633532
<SOS> inquired d'artagnan . <EOS>	102.54723057436416
<SOS> `` well , if he is dead , '' said athos , `` he has not been so long , for he is still warm . <EOS>	62.13717237028445

<SOS> ho , there , my friend ! '' <EOS>	93.71822158900996
<SOS> the wounded man heaved a sigh . <EOS>	67.05847008359264
<SOS> d'artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face . <EOS>	71.57516515589525
<SOS> the man opened his eyes , made an effort to raise his head , and fell back again . <EOS>	49.594512706698175
<SOS> the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously . <EOS>	96.22578648410067
<SOS> aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash . <EOS>	55.363460139896766
<SOS> again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers , who appeared to pity him . <EOS>	53.49833043032518
<SOS> `` you are among friends , '' said athos , in english ; `` so cheer up , and tell us , if you have the strength to do so , what has happened ? '' <EOS>	70.03051210268143

<SOS> `` you have seen him ? '' <EOS>	60.517540369732856
<SOS> asked aramis , in the same language . <EOS>	85.40946654304146
<SOS> the man made no reply . <EOS>	67.53928938342088
<SOS> `` make your mind easy , '' resumed athos , `` we are all faithful servants of his majesty . '' <EOS>	44.109160994195214
<SOS> `` is what you tell me true ? '' <EOS>	89.04767167344636
<SOS> asked the wounded man . <EOS>	83.37856054755567
<SOS> `` on our honor as gentlemen . '' <EOS>	97.68470875968322
<SOS> `` then i may tell you all . <EOS>	70.49415143522633
<SOS> i am brother to parry , his majesty 's lackey . '' <EOS>	73.62162971737223
<SOS> athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king 's tent . <EOS>	90.65481683670842
<SOS> `` we know him , '' said athos , `` he never left the king . '' <EOS>	55.56232197246133
<SOS> `` yes , that is he . <EOS>	49.863144926391364
<SOS> well , he thought of me , when he saw the king was taken , and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king 's name that they would stop , as the king was hungry . <EOS>	70.22426305871598
<SOS> they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows . <EOS>	88.37967217460316
<SOS> parry knew this room , as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle . <EOS>	74.70658456035903
<SOS> he knew that there was a trap door communicating with a cellar , from which one could get into the orchard . <EOS>	70.27016442802223
<SOS> he made a sign , which i understood , but the king 's guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard . <EOS>	81.61064958432296
<SOS> i went out as if to fetch wood , passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar , and whilst parry was gently bolting the door , pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me . <EOS>	69.87592597130396
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	97.86181569387558
<SOS> he would not . <EOS>	72.6376528427233
<SOS> but parry clasped his hands and implored him , and at last he agreed . <EOS>	56.62857700944386
<SOS> i went on first , fortunately . <EOS>	77.80886370105112
<SOS> the king was a few steps behind me , when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow . <EOS>	108.74651908683661
<SOS> i wanted to cry out to warn the king , but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head , and fell insensible . <EOS>	68.7923237825689

<SOS> the king and his escort were no longer there . <EOS>	106.95873037928422

<SOS> `` and now how are you feeling ? '' <EOS>	71.67419150192421

<SOS> `` can we do anything for you ? '' <EOS>	103.93002556702591

<SOS> `` alas , they have taken everything ; there is n't a morsel of bread in the house . '' <EOS>	72.45507796674242
<SOS> `` you hear , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	69.02951932990874
<SOS> said athos ; `` we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner . '' <EOS>	90.30175775671381
<SOS> `` it is all one to me now , '' said d'artagnan ; `` i am no longer hungry . '' <EOS>	89.05469824346139
<SOS> `` faith ! <EOS>	68.36935910522728
<SOS> neither am i , '' said porthos . <EOS>	49.15468179375148
<SOS> they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound . <EOS>	57.09557777715393
<SOS> in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon . <EOS>	69.7227359677096
<SOS> in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room , where they took counsel together . <EOS>	44.40588877756316
<SOS> `` now , '' said aramis , `` we know how the matter stands . <EOS>	67.61355490881061
<SOS> the king and his escort have gone this way ; we had better take the opposite direction , eh ? '' <EOS>	98.58483792255932
<SOS> athos did not reply ; he reflected . <EOS>	53.68470328441258
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos , `` let us take the opposite direction ; if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger . <EOS>	75.4309370304707
<SOS> what a confounded country this england is ! <EOS>	76.78283478539825
<SOS> this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years , and it is generally my best meal . '' <EOS>	72.95901486484594
<SOS> `` what do you think , d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	68.4603987923106
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	101.596627232553
<SOS> `` do you agree with aramis ? '' <EOS>	62.22164066804975
<SOS> `` not at all , '' said d'artagnan ; `` i am precisely of the contrary opinion . '' <EOS>	54.58391900445354
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	96.98705508355962
<SOS> you would follow the escort ? '' <EOS>	94.76726764468373
<SOS> exclaimed porthos , in dismay . <EOS>	116.41219951651146
<SOS> `` no , i would join the escort . '' <EOS>	70.23638195467599
<SOS> athos 's eyes shone with joy . <EOS>	47.83068629169909
<SOS> `` join the escort ! '' <EOS>	53.68271200242331
<SOS> cried aramis . <EOS>	66.0373653637295
<SOS> `` let d'artagnan speak , '' said athos ; `` you know he always has wise advice to give . '' <EOS>	98.85837756030087
<SOS> `` clearly , '' said d'artagnan , `` we must go where they will not look for us . <EOS>	58.31903529999903
<SOS> now , they will be far from looking for us among the puritans ; therefore , with the puritans we must go . '' <EOS>	77.89419678774183
<SOS> `` good , my friend , good ! '' <EOS>	56.14609858985163
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	73.80831291737981
<SOS> `` it is excellent advice . <EOS>	55.62199659956912
<SOS> i was about to give it when you anticipated me . '' <EOS>	62.736672284638686
<SOS> `` that , then , is your opinion ? '' <EOS>	98.28760468471953
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	64.80337970194729
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	51.56078751259796
<SOS> they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports ; meanwhile we shall reach london with the king . <EOS>	50.137114797175464
<SOS> once in london we shall be hard to find without considering , '' continued athos , throwing a glance at aramis , `` the chances that may come to us on the way . '' <EOS>	81.4282628031527
<SOS> `` yes , '' said aramis , `` i understand . '' <EOS>	57.472139258380615
<SOS> `` i , however , do not understand , '' said porthos . <EOS>	86.25954091859246
<SOS> `` but no matter ; since it is at the same time the opinion of d'artagnan and of athos , it must be the best . '' <EOS>	83.31172890960424
<SOS> `` but , '' said aramis , `` shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison ? '' <EOS>	78.67969391103277
<SOS> `` egad ! '' <EOS>	72.15343646790636
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` he 's just the man i count upon . <EOS>	72.16655007532664
<SOS> colonel harrison is one of our friends . <EOS>	54.38820301954468
<SOS> we have met him twice at general cromwell 's . <EOS>	116.0634434002208
<SOS> he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin ; he will consider us as brothers . <EOS>	65.9001335457441
<SOS> besides , is he not a butcher 's son ? <EOS>	42.76467746366491
<SOS> well , then , porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist , and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns . <EOS>	72.92084245149701
<SOS> that will insure his confidence . '' <EOS>	73.92030089933328
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	65.25131864548422
<SOS> `` you are the best companion that i know , d'artagnan , '' he said , offering his hand to the gascon ; `` and i am very happy in having found you again , my dear son . '' <EOS>	93.37257632444081
<SOS> this was , as we have seen , the term which athos applied to d'artagnan in his more expansive moods . <EOS>	59.8525384641796
<SOS> at this moment grimaud came in . <EOS>	92.03547569514053
<SOS> he had stanched the wound and the man was better . <EOS>	101.4147442170933
<SOS> the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother . <EOS>	101.17630603772896
<SOS> `` tell him , '' answered the brave man , `` to let the king know that they have not killed me outright . <EOS>	88.21694831689676
<SOS> however insignificant i am , i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death . '' <EOS>	85.38346290638509
<SOS> `` be easy , '' said d'artagnan , `` he will know all before night . '' <EOS>	73.57400743949856
<SOS> the little troop recommenced their march , and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead . <EOS>	87.38022947289998
<SOS> `` my dear friends , '' said d'artagnan , `` give your swords to monsieur mouston , who will return them to you at the proper time and place , and do not forget you are our prisoners . '' <EOS>	74.26070744178708
<SOS> it was not long before they joined the escort . <EOS>	77.22607120487329
<SOS> the king was riding in front , surrounded by troopers , and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks . <EOS>	50.85696031807373
<SOS> d'artagnan passed to the head of the column , and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos , went straight to harrison , who recognized him as having met him at cromwell 's and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could . <EOS>	84.04819190490493
<SOS> it turned out as d'artagnan had foreseen . <EOS>	84.20523933346404
<SOS> the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion . <EOS>	60.09637412164123
<SOS> they halted for the king to dine . <EOS>	57.73889392772898
<SOS> this time , however , due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape . <EOS>	66.19534520942003
<SOS> in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers . <EOS>	67.26698095408936
<SOS> `` will you dine with me ? '' <EOS>	118.12579025661226
<SOS> asked harrison of d'artagnan . <EOS>	64.29082839141708
<SOS> `` gad , i should be very happy , but i have my companion , monsieur du vallon , and the two prisoners , whom i can not leave . <EOS>	105.76856946132126
<SOS> let us manage it better . <EOS>	100.62481032313336
<SOS> have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours . '' <EOS>	106.00514259343812
<SOS> `` good , '' answered harrison . <EOS>	70.2077638303558
<SOS> the matter was arranged as d'artagnan had suggested , and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table , where parry waited on him , harrison and his officers sitting together at another table , and , in a corner , places reserved for himself and his companions . <EOS>	66.23450031159419
<SOS> the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round , and whether by chance or coarse intention , harrison sat with his back to the king . <EOS>	73.5792838233071
<SOS> the king saw the four gentlemen come in , but appeared to take no notice of them . <EOS>	65.92107627629584
<SOS> they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody . <EOS>	85.73675296550498
<SOS> the officers , table and that of the king were opposite to them . <EOS>	85.38862279539681
<SOS> `` i'faith , colonel , '' said d'artagnan , `` we are very grateful for your gracious invitation ; for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner , as we have without breakfast . <EOS>	47.60118810909528
<SOS> my friend here , monsieur du vallon , shares my gratitude , for he was particularly hungry . '' <EOS>	60.938007882024515
<SOS> `` and i am so still , '' said porthos bowing to harrison . <EOS>	69.5305615160132
<SOS> `` and how , '' said harrison , laughing , `` did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you ? '' <EOS>	80.61454648945826
<SOS> `` in a very simple manner , colonel , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	80.89990170169574
<SOS> `` i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by . <EOS>	98.64704444506805
<SOS> you can understand our disappointment when , arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood , which at a distance had quite a gay appearance , with its red roof and green shutters , we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed ah ! <EOS>	53.87717630800543
<SOS> colonel , pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow . '' <EOS>	84.93807177902126
<SOS> `` yes , '' said harrison , laughing , and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table . <EOS>	44.300979199647315
<SOS> `` when groslow undertakes this kind of thing there 's no need to go over the ground a second time . '' <EOS>	58.38331430834241
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	94.88270975729199
<SOS> it was this gentleman ? '' <EOS>	69.12232280221676
<SOS> said d'artagnan , bowing to the officer . <EOS>	72.18740732101857
<SOS> `` i am sorry he does not speak french , that i might tender him my compliments . '' <EOS>	113.3839819679135
<SOS> `` i am ready to receive and return them , sir , '' said the officer , in pretty good french , `` for i resided three years in paris . '' <EOS>	96.66679916780663
<SOS> `` then , sir , allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man . '' <EOS>	110.19000949559722
<SOS> `` nearly ? <EOS>	57.08546611961159
<SOS> i thought i had quite , '' said groslow . <EOS>	64.74682923395865
<SOS> `` no . <EOS>	60.19705893669628
<SOS> it was a very near thing , but he is not dead . '' <EOS>	98.57457942791699
<SOS> as he said this , d'artagnan gave a glance at parry , who was standing in front of the king , to show him that the news was meant for him . <EOS>	81.87725328940775
<SOS> the king , too , who had listened in the greatest agony , now breathed again . <EOS>	66.23005562295795
<SOS> `` hang it , '' said groslow , `` i thought i had succeeded better . <EOS>	59.36881120695063
<SOS> if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him . '' <EOS>	70.21318609579873
<SOS> `` and you would do well , if you are afraid of his recovering ; for you know , if a wound in the head does not kill at once , it is cured in a week . '' <EOS>	73.39944066489964
<SOS> and d'artagnan threw a second glance toward parry , on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him , smiling . <EOS>	63.9917974151853
<SOS> parry bent over his master 's hand and kissed it respectfully . <EOS>	64.07234978221095
<SOS> `` i 've a great desire to drink the king 's health , '' said athos . <EOS>	93.66995013676208
<SOS> `` let me propose it , then , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	95.99774199177425
<SOS> `` do , '' said aramis . <EOS>	112.18818176638867
<SOS> porthos looked at d'artagnan , quite amazed at the resources with which his companion 's gascon sharpness continually supplied him . <EOS>	72.17079711789162
<SOS> d'artagnan took up his camp tin cup , filled it with wine and arose . <EOS>	76.55296954952473
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said he , `` let us drink to him who presides at the repast . <EOS>	66.11567436231023
<SOS> here 's to our colonel , and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther . '' <EOS>	47.20729432943494
<SOS> and as d'artagnan , as he spoke , looked at harrison , the colonel imagined the toast was for himself . <EOS>	69.74530001975948
<SOS> he arose and bowed to the four friends , whose eyes were fixed on charles , while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving . <EOS>	43.49843886661884
<SOS> the king , in return , looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude . <EOS>	73.89908549155892
<SOS> `` come , gentlemen , '' cried harrison , regardless of his illustrious captive , `` let us be off . '' <EOS>	75.89702526807987
<SOS> `` where do we sleep , colonel ? '' <EOS>	49.987371819350244
<SOS> `` at thirsk , '' replied harrison . <EOS>	86.11669429558945
<SOS> `` parry , '' said the king , rising too , `` my horse ; i desire to go to thirsk . '' <EOS>	97.34170060105754
<SOS> `` egad ! '' <EOS>	93.58742742374565
<SOS> said d'artagnan to athos , `` your king has thoroughly taken me , and i am quite at his service . '' <EOS>	69.46271399171664
<SOS> `` if what you say is sincere , '' replied athos , `` he will never reach london . '' <EOS>	73.0812832798198
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	78.89700496303473
<SOS> `` because before then we shall have carried him off . '' <EOS>	48.45015115881853
<SOS> `` well , this time , athos , '' said d'artagnan , `` upon my word , you are mad . '' <EOS>	106.74167658116363
<SOS> `` have you some plan in your head then ? '' <EOS>	54.654342294535525
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	69.82572193153365
<SOS> `` ay ! '' <EOS>	60.31106433155129
<SOS> said porthos , `` the thing would not be impossible with a good plan . '' <EOS>	87.41835672313582
<SOS> `` i have none , '' said athos ; `` but d'artagnan will discover one . '' <EOS>	83.6519386876978
<SOS> d'artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded . <EOS>	93.82154858356118
<SOS> chapter lxi . <EOS>	90.29006297644759
<SOS> d'artagnan hits on a plan . <EOS>	88.1316853380576
<SOS> as night closed in they arrived at thirsk . <EOS>	92.18939328248594
<SOS> the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king . <EOS>	77.31849503398833
<SOS> they withdrew to a private house , and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety , they occupied but one room and provided an exit , which might be useful in case of an attack . <EOS>	46.63844656131178
<SOS> the lackeys were sent to their several posts , except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway . <EOS>	61.97662631871263
<SOS> d'artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity . <EOS>	89.8524547695739
<SOS> porthos , who could never see anything that was not self evident , talked to him as usual . <EOS>	62.61191514463426
<SOS> he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another . <EOS>	53.44216363151612
<SOS> next morning d'artagnan was the first to rise . <EOS>	97.08238109593859
<SOS> he had been down to the stables , already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day , whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring . <EOS>	49.06499296916706
<SOS> at eight o'clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before , except that d'artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow . <EOS>	90.46829376792148
<SOS> groslow , whom d'artagnan 's praises had greatly pleased , welcomed him with a gracious smile . <EOS>	53.245037818995186
<SOS> `` really , sir , '' d'artagnan said to him , `` i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue . <EOS>	78.06420438159053
<SOS> my friend , monsieur du vallon , is of a very melancholy disposition , so much so , that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day . <EOS>	57.124864946629465
<SOS> as for our two prisoners , you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation . '' <EOS>	93.93596097476726
<SOS> `` they are hot royalists , '' said groslow . <EOS>	91.69242653180841
<SOS> `` the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart , for whom , i hope , you 're preparing a pretty trial . '' <EOS>	72.67562133592806
<SOS> `` why , '' said groslow , `` that is just what we are taking him to london for . '' <EOS>	59.938437796724536
<SOS> `` and you never by any chance lose sight of him , i presume ? '' <EOS>	90.15785441632991
<SOS> `` i should think not , indeed . <EOS>	91.99188890196045
<SOS> you see he has a truly royal escort . '' <EOS>	52.97770855967063
<SOS> `` ay , there 's no fear in the daytime ; but at night ? '' <EOS>	51.84987198357964
<SOS> `` we redouble our precautions . '' <EOS>	61.27337271705099
<SOS> `` and what method of surveillance do you employ ? '' <EOS>	105.94734929765555
<SOS> `` eight men remain constantly in his room . '' <EOS>	68.88709113255567
<SOS> `` the deuce , he is well guarded , then . <EOS>	69.75136537648905
<SOS> but besides these eight men , you doubtless place some guard outside ? '' <EOS>	96.23993939264628
<SOS> `` oh , no ! <EOS>	104.89787127633504
<SOS> just think . <EOS>	64.45970290075499
<SOS> what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men ? '' <EOS>	79.23767993504953
<SOS> `` two men how do you mean ? '' <EOS>	69.87618560284692
<SOS> `` yes , the king and his lackey . '' <EOS>	103.70363900716815
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	103.56636167511833
<SOS> then they allow the lackey to remain with him ? '' <EOS>	64.97183204689965
<SOS> `` yes ; stuart begged this favor and harrison consented . <EOS>	50.46524009918729
<SOS> under pretense that he 's a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance . '' <EOS>	92.43541068195917
<SOS> `` really , captain , '' said d'artagnan , determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced , `` the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french . <EOS>	57.47523700860343
<SOS> you have lived three years in paris ? <EOS>	118.0421895119551
<SOS> may i ask what you were doing there ? '' <EOS>	82.42630194147014
<SOS> `` my father , who is a merchant , placed me with his correspondent , who in turn sent his son to join our house in london . '' <EOS>	55.27319674594942
<SOS> `` were you pleased with paris , sir ? '' <EOS>	100.89217180404461
<SOS> `` yes , but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king , who is a mere child , but against that lazar of an italian , the queen 's favorite . '' <EOS>	82.22477787775975
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	60.72999852899311
<SOS> i am quite of your opinion , sir , and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself , without prejudices , vigilant and incorruptible . '' <EOS>	76.4809789073548
<SOS> `` but , '' said the officer , `` i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell . '' <EOS>	62.991080870126446

<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	68.71750649477791

<SOS> `` jesus dieu ! '' <EOS>	70.21402130592782
<SOS> he cried ; `` one of them is trembling with fever , having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours , and the other is a knight of malta , as timid as a young girl ; and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors .

<SOS> `` what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog ? '' <EOS>	69.46562238224637

<SOS> `` my dear fellow , do n't speak like that of monsieur groslow . <EOS>	46.60275982712282

<SOS> `` one of your friends ! '' <EOS>	59.56805104037134

<SOS> porthos opened his eyes in amazement ; athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled ; they knew d'artagnan , and knew that he did nothing without a purpose . <EOS>	59.22802153380868
<SOS> `` but , '' continued d'artagnan , `` you shall judge of him for yourself . <EOS>	85.09336951838668

<SOS> `` oho ! '' <EOS>	72.66557475737076

<SOS> `` the more so , as it will be the prelude to a better . '' <EOS>	83.55083136002271
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	65.00875743588595
<SOS> `` we invite him to play to night ; he has invited us in return to morrow . <EOS>	73.2139873308521

<SOS> to night we stop at derby ; and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it . <EOS>	64.9914632808814
<SOS> it will be well to prepare a light supper , of which you , athos and aramis , are not to partake athos , because i told him you had a fever ; aramis , because you are a knight of malta and wo n't mix with fellows like us . <EOS>	77.27901843370401
<SOS> do you understand ? '' <EOS>	74.66374863234685
<SOS> `` that 's no doubt very fine , '' said porthos ; `` but deuce take me if i understand at all . '' <EOS>	48.038713408247446
<SOS> `` porthos , my friend , you know i am descended on the father 's side from the prophets and on the mother 's from the sybils , and that i only speak in parables and riddles . <EOS>	65.22109717004838
<SOS> let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see ; i can tell you nothing more at present . '' <EOS>	69.67427169426612
<SOS> `` go ahead , my friend , '' said athos ; `` i am sure that whatever you do is well done . '' <EOS>	79.33372603123097
<SOS> `` and you , aramis , are you of that opinion ? '' <EOS>	95.92083265326556
<SOS> `` entirely so , my dear d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	80.56322812295662
<SOS> `` very good , '' said d'artagnan ; `` here indeed are true believers ; it is a pleasure to work miracles before them ; they are not like that unbelieving porthos , who must see and touch before he will believe . '' <EOS>	52.92083473885085
<SOS> `` the fact is , '' said porthos , with an air of finesse , `` i am rather incredulous . '' <EOS>	57.263377117244886
<SOS> d'artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder , and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast , the conversation ended there . <EOS>	69.5479785679158
<SOS> at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon . <EOS>	50.265843460351206
<SOS> blaisois went with him . <EOS>	57.24413285808462
<SOS> in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house . <EOS>	68.48930669104004
<SOS> it was there a lodging was prepared for them . <EOS>	70.44624007385428
<SOS> at the hour agreed upon groslow came . <EOS>	67.8057751261208
<SOS> d'artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years ' standing . <EOS>	115.38912884108521
<SOS> porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parry 's brother , he was not nearly so strong as himself . <EOS>	52.77266070060631
<SOS> athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality . <EOS>	106.10208356192695
<SOS> in short , groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception . <EOS>	60.813967568027834
<SOS> athos and aramis kept themselves to their role . <EOS>	117.2853366838894
<SOS> at midnight they withdrew to their chamber , the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration . <EOS>	98.23634327363024
<SOS> furthermore , d'artagnan went with them , leaving porthos at play with groslow . <EOS>	78.10521502511986
<SOS> porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow , and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be . <EOS>	54.30159895964663
<SOS> as to groslow , he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d'artagnan what he had lost to porthos , and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment . <EOS>	55.301320499277566
<SOS> the next day was spent as usual . <EOS>	84.50705181129584
<SOS> d'artagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends . <EOS>	68.87582660755453
<SOS> to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition ; but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety . <EOS>	58.905538534379964
<SOS> `` what is he contriving ? '' <EOS>	59.44080852237319
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	64.37644759166494
<SOS> `` wait , '' said athos . <EOS>	93.36974148963915
<SOS> porthos said nothing , but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing . <EOS>	77.71819791369575
<SOS> arrived at ryston , d'artagnan assembled his friends . <EOS>	74.377978438827
<SOS> his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day . <EOS>	46.77483035744614
<SOS> athos pinched aramis 's hand . <EOS>	75.66709517960552
<SOS> `` the moment is at hand , '' he said . <EOS>	68.94044864462633
<SOS> `` yes , '' returned d'artagnan , who had overheard him , `` to night , gentlemen , we rescue the king . '' <EOS>	99.87887298281927
<SOS> `` d'artagnan , '' said athos , `` this is no joke , i trust ? <EOS>	56.758247744383596
<SOS> it would quite cut me up . '' <EOS>	89.4662939105095
<SOS> `` you are a very odd man , athos , '' he replied , `` to doubt me thus . <EOS>	85.80672658321913
<SOS> where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend 's heart and a king 's life ? <EOS>	74.13508802947028
<SOS> i have told you , and i repeat it , that to night we rescue charles i . <EOS>	69.83189927227615
<SOS> you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so . '' <EOS>	88.04944083294392
<SOS> porthos looked at d'artagnan with an expression of profound admiration . <EOS>	72.03390928349496
<SOS> aramis smiled as one who hopes . <EOS>	56.99023697480723
<SOS> athos was pale , and trembled in every limb . <EOS>	71.04260576076929
<SOS> `` speak , '' said athos . <EOS>	55.926547218512056

<SOS> we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant . '' <EOS>	67.55041349807864
<SOS> athos placed his two hands on d'artagnan 's shoulders , and gazed at him with his calm , sad smile . <EOS>	103.08363360294021
<SOS> `` i declare , my friend , '' said he , `` that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage . <EOS>	70.97675813722076

<SOS> we , on our side , do the same . <EOS>	87.42616701188118
<SOS> that will be four killed . <EOS>	89.12218669463493
<SOS> we shall then be matched , four against the remaining five . <EOS>	97.61111390629954
<SOS> if these five men give themselves up we gag them ; if they resist , we kill them . <EOS>	55.2769253866073
<SOS> if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself , why , then , we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one . <EOS>	72.762146851091
<SOS> it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance , but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time . '' <EOS>	93.7494183148954
<SOS> `` but if you yourselves should be struck ? '' <EOS>	60.83370083083553
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	48.78193822920521
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	78.64806758782774
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward . <EOS>	55.92454470273487
<SOS> besides , you will strike at the throat , porthos ; it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry . '' <EOS>	61.449727694602714
<SOS> `` very good , '' said porthos ; `` it will be a nice little throat cutting . '' <EOS>	79.24183023253372
<SOS> `` horrible , horrible , '' exclaimed athos . <EOS>	50.526858873013246
<SOS> `` nonsense , '' said d'artagnan ; `` you would do as much , mr . <EOS>	75.43415908251997

<SOS> at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them . <EOS>	84.01414124863794
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	85.01249234650241
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	96.26318675593544
<SOS> `` in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar , '' replied the staunch puritan . <EOS>	75.47391782862121
<SOS> `` good , '' replied athos , whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty ; `` tell the captain we are coming . '' <EOS>	46.08650222904815
<SOS> the puritan then went out . <EOS>	80.30174484256497
<SOS> the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait , keeping together and without dismounting , at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged . <EOS>	53.587888408078705
<SOS> it was nine o'clock in the evening ; the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour . <EOS>	79.10184554238117
<SOS> d'artagnan and porthos , armed with their swords , and athos and aramis , each carrying a concealed poniard , approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart 's prison . <EOS>	63.37921602385607
<SOS> the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives , without arms . <EOS>	81.65868976161478
<SOS> `` od 's bodikins , '' said groslow , as the four friends entered , `` i had almost given you up . '' <EOS>	83.46237079056601
<SOS> d'artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear : `` the fact is , we , that is , monsieur du vallon and i , hesitated a little . '' <EOS>	65.29936577997285
<SOS> `` and why ? '' <EOS>	56.143717274567194
<SOS> d'artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis . <EOS>	119.39903161245039
<SOS> `` aha , '' said groslow ; `` on account of political opinions ? <EOS>	57.01712962005171
<SOS> no matter . <EOS>	76.80981097212661
<SOS> on the contrary , '' he added , laughing , `` if they want to see their stuart they shall see him . <EOS>	97.42825137734818
<SOS> `` are we to pass the night in the king 's room ? '' <EOS>	58.846191780972966
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	89.19129715605418
<SOS> `` no , but in the one next to it , and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing . <EOS>	54.5651628564207
<SOS> have you provided yourself with money ? <EOS>	61.31046818512216
<SOS> i assure you i intend to play the devil 's game to night . '' <EOS>	114.36123567590016
<SOS> d'artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets . <EOS>	80.42895541590428
<SOS> `` very good , '' said groslow , and opened the door of the room . <EOS>	82.34269679708936
<SOS> `` i will show you the way , '' and he went in first . <EOS>	97.39105363082257
<SOS> d'artagnan turned to look at his friends . <EOS>	108.00310967923404
<SOS> porthos was perfectly indifferent ; athos , pale , but resolute ; aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow . <EOS>	42.545708854095295
<SOS> the eight guards were at their posts . <EOS>	56.37982693087134
<SOS> four in the king 's room , two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered . <EOS>	70.18792396155044
<SOS> athos smiled when he saw their bare swords ; he felt it was no longer to be a butchery , but a fight , and he resumed his usual good humor . <EOS>	72.43011017920404
<SOS> charles was perceived through the door , lying dressed upon his bed , at the head of which parry was seated , reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible . <EOS>	81.29306098578796
<SOS> a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer , far less calm . <EOS>	112.43542705425149
<SOS> from time to time parry stopped , thinking the king , whose eyes were closed , was really asleep , but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile : `` go on , my good parry , i am listening . '' <EOS>	53.87715806302345
<SOS> groslow advanced to the door of the king 's room , replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests , looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple , yet touching scene , then turning to d'artagnan , assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved . <EOS>	81.95981622799302
<SOS> `` capital ! '' <EOS>	93.95434086234607
<SOS> cried the gascon , `` you would make a distinguished general . '' <EOS>	52.801210899603184
<SOS> `` and do you think , '' asked groslow , `` that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard ? '' <EOS>	74.10268289300666
<SOS> `` no , to be sure , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` unless , forsooth , the sky rains friends upon him . '' <EOS>	43.68649437796044
<SOS> groslow 's face brightened . <EOS>	80.48482123386405
<SOS> it is impossible to say whether charles , who kept his eyes constantly closed , had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain , but the moment he heard the clear tone of d'artagnan 's voice his eyelids rose , in spite of himself . <EOS>	67.66747502552114
<SOS> parry , too , started and stopped reading . <EOS>	84.88366385521348
<SOS> `` what are you thinking about ? '' <EOS>	99.73141748821335
<SOS> said the king ; `` go on , my good parry , unless you are tired . '' <EOS>	92.27608246142269
<SOS> parry resumed his reading . <EOS>	104.67412998296456
<SOS> on a table in the next room were lighted candles , cards , two dice boxes , and dice . <EOS>	61.565054889555825
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said groslow , `` i beg you will take your places . <EOS>	74.75247839286594
<SOS> i will sit facing stuart , whom i like so much to see , especially where he now is , and you , monsieur d'artagnan , opposite to me . '' <EOS>	66.48588656317621
<SOS> athos turned red with rage . <EOS>	53.766040157220026
<SOS> d'artagnan frowned at him . <EOS>	61.01421239612139
<SOS> `` that 's it , '' said d'artagnan ; `` you , monsieur le comte de la fere , to the right of monsieur groslow . <EOS>	83.56676941059628
<SOS> you , chevalier d'herblay , to his left . <EOS>	91.78694362360939
<SOS> du vallon next me . <EOS>	64.20061844412442
<SOS> you 'll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow . '' <EOS>	74.33670745236246
<SOS> by this arrangement d'artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis . <EOS>	71.5988992810169
<SOS> at the names comte de la fere and chevalier d'herblay , charles opened his eyes , and raising his noble head , in spite of himself , threw a glance at all the actors in the scene . <EOS>	58.77750457332384
<SOS> at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah : `` god said , 'hear ye the words of the prophets my servants , whom i have sent unto you . ' '' <EOS>	84.5210493616701
<SOS> the four friends exchanged glances . <EOS>	72.95548685095376
<SOS> the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive . <EOS>	74.34078630209754
<SOS> d'artagnan 's eyes sparkled with joy . <EOS>	70.9761153780208
<SOS> `` you asked me just now if i was in funds , '' said d'artagnan , placing some twenty pistoles upon the table . <EOS>	81.23904142747
<SOS> `` well , in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure , my dear monsieur groslow , for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it . '' <EOS>	57.41428733388409
<SOS> `` not without my defending it , '' said groslow . <EOS>	101.77845911832853
<SOS> `` so much the better , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	109.41748121183782
<SOS> `` fight , my dear captain , fight . <EOS>	49.02427088743559
<SOS> you know or you do n't know , that that is what we ask of you . '' <EOS>	73.08457440120586
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	88.43608347229588
<SOS> yes , '' said groslow , bursting with his usual coarse laugh , `` i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises . '' <EOS>	75.07451502105421
<SOS> charles had heard and understood it all . <EOS>	50.51515110278636
<SOS> a slight color mounted to his cheeks . <EOS>	68.80757676151677
<SOS> the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs , little by little , and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him . <EOS>	87.21371463925439
<SOS> athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on . <EOS>	69.58229420772717
<SOS> the game began . <EOS>	68.47424329909646
<SOS> the luck had turned , and groslow , having won some hundred pistoles , was in the merriest possible humor . <EOS>	102.35996482051597
<SOS> porthos , who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides , was very cross and questioned d'artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game . <EOS>	77.06218151242888
<SOS> athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly . <EOS>	97.98443330640751
<SOS> but d'artagnan remained impassible . <EOS>	89.6155093299724
<SOS> it struck ten . <EOS>	70.03092812812815
<SOS> they heard the guard going its rounds . <EOS>	84.59910470835715
<SOS> `` how many rounds do they make a night ? '' <EOS>	75.40038649817092
<SOS> asked d'artagnan , drawing more pistoles from his pocket . <EOS>	81.21326455425121
<SOS> `` five , '' answered groslow , `` one every two hours . '' <EOS>	68.37359111896866
<SOS> d'artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos 's nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive . <EOS>	55.515351930209654
<SOS> meanwhile , the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king 's room , attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men , had stolen little by little toward the table , and standing on tiptoe , lounged , watching the game , over the shoulders of d'artagnan and porthos . <EOS>	87.17210449198303
<SOS> those on the other side had followed their example , thus favoring the views of the four friends , who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber . <EOS>	77.7702513416924
<SOS> the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed , but they were leaning on them while they watched the game . <EOS>	108.90427162088211
<SOS> athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached . <EOS>	83.2348051301805
<SOS> with his white , aristocratic hands he played with the louis , bending and straightening them again , as if they were made of pewter . <EOS>	74.86773333025104
<SOS> aramis , less self controlled , fumbled continually with his hidden poniard . <EOS>	64.78258992690688
<SOS> porthos , impatient at his continued losses , kept up a vigorous play with his knee . <EOS>	91.36434305242969
<SOS> d'artagnan turned , mechanically looking behind him , and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god . <EOS>	69.28212104305055
<SOS> d'artagnan saw that the moment was come . <EOS>	73.83764095223779
<SOS> he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis , who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action . <EOS>	72.68797914307996
<SOS> he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard . <EOS>	74.36852901273879
<SOS> `` hang it ! '' <EOS>	68.59944619767522
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` another twenty pistoles lost . <EOS>	107.34612592099997
<SOS> really , captain groslow , you are too much in fortune 's way . <EOS>	79.08671748382119
<SOS> this ca n't last , '' and he drew another twenty from his pocket . <EOS>	78.64914937898745
<SOS> `` one more turn , captain ; twenty pistoles on one throw only one , the last . '' <EOS>	91.65337053880981
<SOS> `` done for twenty , '' replied groslow . <EOS>	85.26083094508098
<SOS> and he turned up two cards as usual , a king for d'artagnan and an ace for himself . <EOS>	62.48057291416529
<SOS> `` a king , '' said d'artagnan ; `` it 's a good omen , master groslow look out for the king . '' <EOS>	57.93846278999443
<SOS> and in spite of his extraordinary self control there was a strange vibration in the gascon 's voice which made his partner start . <EOS>	58.38134401500496
<SOS> groslow began turning the cards one after another . <EOS>	63.80172454688974
<SOS> if he turned up an ace first he won ; if a king he lost . <EOS>	99.69799427383107
<SOS> he turned up a king . <EOS>	92.83559485206462
<SOS> `` at last ! '' <EOS>	106.72752654733401
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.4022922296781
<SOS> at this word athos and aramis jumped up . <EOS>	67.14275090151014
<SOS> porthos drew back a step . <EOS>	105.96617209915117
<SOS> daggers and swords were just about to shine , when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway , accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak . <EOS>	65.0841707998424
<SOS> behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers . <EOS>	61.86944744602476
<SOS> groslow jumped up , ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine , cards , and dice . <EOS>	55.487306795784754
<SOS> but harrison paid not the least attention to him , and entering the king 's room , followed by his companion : `` charles stuart , '' said he , `` an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night . <EOS>	69.49397112575731
<SOS> prepare yourself , then , to start at once . '' <EOS>	56.16011852963354
<SOS> `` and by whom is this order given ? '' <EOS>	55.31253585792146
<SOS> asked the king . <EOS>	46.21239825068765
<SOS> `` by general oliver cromwell . <EOS>	95.29957008341121
<SOS> and here is mr. mordaunt , who has brought it and is charged with its execution . '' <EOS>	60.79382016607271
<SOS> `` mordaunt ! '' <EOS>	100.86178393422377
<SOS> muttered the four friends , exchanging glances . <EOS>	64.5465137606783
<SOS> d'artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket . <EOS>	58.743944858401754
<SOS> athos and aramis placed themselves behind him . <EOS>	58.329546930792525
<SOS> at this movement mordaunt turned around , recognized them , and uttered an exclamation of savage delight . <EOS>	62.03060869549491
<SOS> `` i 'm afraid we are prisoners , '' whispered d'artagnan to his friend . <EOS>	88.10956791482027
<SOS> `` not yet , '' replied porthos . <EOS>	51.088050622589805
<SOS> `` colonel , colonel , '' cried mordaunt , `` you are betrayed . <EOS>	38.61050987000072
<SOS> these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle , and no doubt want to carry off the king . <EOS>	85.88179115790288
<SOS> arrest them . '' <EOS>	74.69922567333602
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	76.9791706865511
<SOS> my young man , '' said d'artagnan , drawing his sword , `` that is an order sooner given than executed . <EOS>	64.04076540086673
<SOS> fly , friends , fly ! '' <EOS>	67.96625340446393
<SOS> he added , whirling his sword around him . <EOS>	67.32373163023712
<SOS> the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it , before they had time to cock their muskets . <EOS>	74.62920599886529
<SOS> athos and aramis followed him . <EOS>	72.13663801229796
<SOS> porthos brought up the rear , and before soldiers , officers , or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street . <EOS>	61.7045339893132
<SOS> `` fire ! '' <EOS>	75.683949137314
<SOS> cried mordaunt ; `` fire upon them ! '' <EOS>	88.96610547016368
<SOS> three or four shots were fired , but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound . <EOS>	74.23101561351126
<SOS> the horses were at the place fixed upon , and they leaped lightly into their saddles . <EOS>	40.06874963488071
<SOS> `` forward ! '' <EOS>	89.56172056469588
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` and spur for your dear lives ! '' <EOS>	58.97373264859999
<SOS> they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning , namely , in the direction toward scotland . <EOS>	98.97409913872006
<SOS> a few hundred yards beyond the town d'artagnan drew rein . <EOS>	79.04388863104573
<SOS> `` halt ! '' <EOS>	56.105355048474955
<SOS> he cried , `` this time we shall be pursued . <EOS>	42.79315472899557
<SOS> we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road , and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction . '' <EOS>	107.41610293615246
<SOS> there was a stream close by and a bridge across it . <EOS>	85.76005258576645
<SOS> d'artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge . <EOS>	70.7981777085809
<SOS> the others followed . <EOS>	57.04499175929056
<SOS> ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen . <EOS>	53.79955773977745
<SOS> a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads . <EOS>	53.09269491413769
<SOS> chapter lxii . <EOS>	68.13369358776198
<SOS> london . <EOS>	63.44302452645464
<SOS> as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d'artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain , followed by his three friends , directing their course , as well as they could guess , toward london . <EOS>	103.33934029633134
<SOS> `` this time , '' said d'artagnan , when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot , `` i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france . <EOS>	74.15781993320256
<SOS> what do you say , athos , to that proposition ? <EOS>	82.38332540633814
<SOS> is n't it reasonable ? '' <EOS>	76.42316818401567
<SOS> `` yes , dear friend , '' athos replied , `` but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous . <EOS>	107.69961076367004

<SOS> `` entirely , my dear count . <EOS>	69.63183528508672
<SOS> then , too , i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again . <EOS>	70.33194675575163
<SOS> it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him , and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts , of this kind , at least . '' <EOS>	69.17317011245689
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	40.11937542604666
<SOS> that 's another thing , '' said d'artagnan , `` and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question . <EOS>	90.84192952633813
<SOS> only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count ; for i imagine , just now , that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us . <EOS>	87.48366961926493
<SOS> athos , do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets , roast beef reasonably cooked , and wine which is not made of hops and gin ? '' <EOS>	93.94711840708275
<SOS> `` i think i know what you want , '' replied athos . <EOS>	103.06732459504491
<SOS> `` de winter took us to the house of a spaniard , who , he said , had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots . <EOS>	69.43427270811662

<SOS> `` why , the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable , and for my part i agree to it . <EOS>	96.12044613621072
<SOS> we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter , for whom he seemed to have a great regard ; we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on ; we will spend with him a guinea each per day ; and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed . '' <EOS>	68.46105919359165
<SOS> `` you forget , aramis , one precaution of considerable importance . '' <EOS>	64.7295950250205
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	80.23492039742791
<SOS> `` the precaution of changing our clothes . '' <EOS>	64.31566495618918
<SOS> `` changing our clothes ! '' <EOS>	61.789681060743575
<SOS> exclaimed porthos . <EOS>	54.2933489290453
<SOS> `` i do n't see why ; we are very comfortable in those we wear . '' <EOS>	90.98257539362453
<SOS> `` to prevent recognition , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	38.28338495391892
<SOS> `` our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight . <EOS>	50.06304854973461

<SOS> i shall buy a chestnut colored suit . <EOS>	76.183007043518

<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	108.84859453019281
<SOS> to be sure , yes . <EOS>	70.36936993791895
<SOS> he lives at the bedford tavern , greenhall street . <EOS>	81.41915123266638
<SOS> besides , i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut . '' <EOS>	86.64703296179701
<SOS> `` i wish we were already there , '' said d'artagnan ; `` and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak , even if we kill our horses . '' <EOS>	100.06653187880255
<SOS> `` come on , then , '' said athos , `` for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go . '' <EOS>	96.7816337921791
<SOS> the friends urged on their horses and arrived , in fact , at about five o'clock in the morning . <EOS>	46.23614398995172
<SOS> they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city , but athos replied , in excellent english , that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague , monsieur bridge , the approach of the king . <EOS>	88.3306393231234
<SOS> that reply led to several questions about the king 's capture , and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely . <EOS>	102.03416894523968
<SOS> the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations . <EOS>	105.40270180743374
<SOS> athos was right . <EOS>	89.46736244256753
<SOS> he went direct to the bedford tavern , and the host , who recognized him , was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company . <EOS>	76.19481830662332
<SOS> though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle , owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king . <EOS>	71.53410155631478
<SOS> the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted . <EOS>	77.83843876921956
<SOS> the landlord sent out for every description of garment , as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe . <EOS>	111.99667454996882
<SOS> athos chose a black coat , which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen . <EOS>	82.17038355475255
<SOS> aramis , not wishing to part with his sword , selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut . <EOS>	77.59727236337832
<SOS> porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches . <EOS>	75.96884853834825
<SOS> d'artagnan , who had fixed on his color beforehand , had only to select the shade , and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer . <EOS>	101.4641024954233
<SOS> `` now , '' said d'artagnan , `` for the actual man . <EOS>	65.34309850083685
<SOS> we must cut off our hair , that the populace may not insult us . <EOS>	68.86209986493431
<SOS> as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan . <EOS>	62.082299744853835
<SOS> this , as you know , is the important point of distinction between the covenanter and the cavalier . '' <EOS>	63.58112019591602
<SOS> after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber . <EOS>	101.95959228194839
<SOS> `` we look hideous , '' said athos . <EOS>	45.54557936989925
<SOS> `` and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent , '' said aramis . <EOS>	81.90586127403203
<SOS> `` my head feels actually cold , '' said porthos . <EOS>	50.73479971637488
<SOS> `` as for me , i feel anxious to preach a sermon , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.62496360704763
<SOS> `` now , '' said athos , `` that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us , let us go and see the king 's entrance . '' <EOS>	81.52619216762201
<SOS> they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king 's arrival . <EOS>	73.22135256301324
<SOS> a carriage had been sent to meet him , and the gigantic porthos , who stood a head above the entire rabble , soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching . <EOS>	45.646608691488886
<SOS> d'artagnan raised himself on tiptoe , and as the carriage passed , saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other . <EOS>	89.259775218822
<SOS> the next day , athos , leaning out of his window , which looked upon the most populous part of the city , heard the act of parliament , which summoned the ex king , charles i. , to the bar , publicly cried . <EOS>	43.63752014240596
<SOS> `` parliament indeed ! '' <EOS>	70.15613220702983
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	93.85656092296028
<SOS> `` parliament can never have passed such an act as that . '' <EOS>	73.68076433606302
<SOS> at this moment the landlord came in . <EOS>	105.34419826721158
<SOS> `` did parliament pass this act ? '' <EOS>	92.62339636420704
<SOS> athos asked of him in english . <EOS>	41.11308049210426
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , the pure parliament . '' <EOS>	69.31139335144734
<SOS> `` what do you mean by 'the pure parliament ' ? <EOS>	65.50869743818454
<SOS> are there , then , two parliaments ? '' <EOS>	56.316319230705645
<SOS> `` my friend , '' d'artagnan interrupted , `` as i do n't understand english and we all understand spanish , have the kindness to speak to us in that language , which , since it is your own , you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance . '' <EOS>	97.28836775230958
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	79.69350357591826
<SOS> excellent ! '' <EOS>	43.33150235977976
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	102.4802778219873
<SOS> as to porthos , all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table . <EOS>	52.26903071920921
<SOS> `` you were asking , then ? '' <EOS>	58.36127950472732
<SOS> said the host in spanish . <EOS>	95.16382782642489
<SOS> `` i asked , '' said athos , in the same language , `` if there are two parliaments , a pure and an impure ? '' <EOS>	87.66676769187795
<SOS> `` why , how extraordinary ! '' <EOS>	101.25670839454789
<SOS> said porthos , slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment , `` i understand english , then ! <EOS>	87.41257606880653
<SOS> i understand what you say ! '' <EOS>	76.15633346893001
<SOS> `` that is because we are talking spanish , my dear friend , '' said athos . <EOS>	92.3482417962445
<SOS> `` oh , the devil ! '' <EOS>	99.06263418157862
<SOS> said porthos , `` i am sorry for that ; it would have been one language more . '' <EOS>	77.29889152635829
<SOS> `` when i speak of the pure parliament , '' resumed the host , `` i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded . '' <EOS>	90.03117818043926
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	39.37059833460764
<SOS> really , '' said d'artagnan , `` these people are very ingenious . <EOS>	54.5233112552441
<SOS> when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor . <EOS>	107.98282020875759
<SOS> one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court , and the other in the name of the people ; and then there wo n't be any parliament at all . '' <EOS>	86.61680358103357
<SOS> `` and who is this colonel bridge ? '' <EOS>	81.59296415027998
<SOS> asked aramis , `` and how does he go to work to weed the parliament ? '' <EOS>	82.95708237083016
<SOS> `` colonel bridge , '' replied the spaniard , `` is a retired wagoner , a man of much sense , who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team , namely , that where there happened to be a stone on the road , it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it . <EOS>	110.82114504719058
<SOS> now , of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament , there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon . <EOS>	61.47314745438007
<SOS> he took them up , just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road , and threw them out of the house . '' <EOS>	76.15297175577867
<SOS> `` neat , '' remarked d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.458550594197476
<SOS> `` very ! '' <EOS>	69.36243309701898
<SOS> `` and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists ? '' <EOS>	104.50965542212361
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	68.73272156759705
<SOS> `` without doubt , senor ; and you understand that they would have saved the king . '' <EOS>	66.13102490538652
<SOS> `` to be sure , '' said porthos , with majestic common sense ; `` they were in the majority . '' <EOS>	89.07188892190511
<SOS> `` and you think , '' said aramis , `` he will consent to appear before such a tribunal ? '' <EOS>	61.920917289720954
<SOS> `` he will be forced to do so , '' smiled the spaniard . <EOS>	68.78984434063477
<SOS> `` now , athos ! '' <EOS>	47.01722417397276
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` do you begin to believe that it 's a ruined cause , and that what with your harrisons , joyces , bridges and cromwells , we shall never get the upper hand ? '' <EOS>	79.22339955945375
<SOS> `` the king will be delivered at the tribunal , '' said athos ; `` the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work . '' <EOS>	93.8216815163611
<SOS> d'artagnan shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	87.43212248912775
<SOS> `` but , '' said aramis , `` if they dare to condemn their king , it can only be to exile or imprisonment . '' <EOS>	65.58199821036527
<SOS> d'artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity . <EOS>	68.7285093190305
<SOS> `` we shall see , '' said athos , `` for we shall go to the sittings , i presume . '' <EOS>	63.58798956143105
<SOS> `` you will not have long to wait , '' said the landlord ; `` they begin to morrow . '' <EOS>	100.4327094742813
<SOS> `` so , then , they drew up the indictments before the king was taken ? '' <EOS>	84.347087647437
<SOS> `` of course , '' said d'artagnan ; `` they began the day he was sold . '' <EOS>	79.1335552049277
<SOS> `` and you know , '' said aramis , `` that it was our friend mordaunt who made , if not the bargain , at least the overtures . '' <EOS>	55.3563391221898
<SOS> `` and you know , '' added d'artagnan , `` that whenever i catch him i will kill him , this mordaunt . '' <EOS>	72.45454559509268
<SOS> `` and i , too , '' exclaimed porthos . <EOS>	91.69268636910425
<SOS> `` and i , too , '' added aramis . <EOS>	83.39620359535665
<SOS> `` touching unanimity ! '' <EOS>	64.3774500297216
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` which well becomes good citizens like us . <EOS>	57.67269329708635
<SOS> let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog . '' <EOS>	80.62011828543662
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos , `` 'twill be at least a little change from beer . '' <EOS>	86.94821646593245
<SOS> chapter lxiii . <EOS>	71.46728104216157
<SOS> the trial . <EOS>	65.63715875498183
<SOS> the next morning king charles i. was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him . <EOS>	49.48462886197224
<SOS> all london was crowding to the doors of the house . <EOS>	46.91147219341341
<SOS> the throng was terrific , and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination . <EOS>	63.26163589624467
<SOS> when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied ; but being anxious not to be too conspicuous , all , with the exception of porthos , who had a fancy to display his red doublet , were quite satisfied with their places , the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row , so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner . <EOS>	84.14717102643743
<SOS> toward eleven o'clock the king entered the hall , surrounded by guards , but wearing his head covered , and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance , as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects , rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court . <EOS>	77.71379082992641
<SOS> the judges , proud of having a monarch to humiliate , evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves , and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head . <EOS>	83.3769649885812
<SOS> charles , without replying a single word , turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it . <EOS>	64.86840389224828
<SOS> then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand . <EOS>	67.17423152629719
<SOS> parry , who accompanied him , stood behind him . <EOS>	59.524499443587075
<SOS> d'artagnan was looking at athos , whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king , possessing more self control , had banished from his own . <EOS>	44.58893046708416
<SOS> this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos , frightened him . <EOS>	72.80123913702982
<SOS> `` i hope , '' he whispered to him , `` that you will follow his majesty 's example and not get killed for your folly in this den . '' <EOS>	68.98095694504487
<SOS> `` set your mind at rest , '' replied athos . <EOS>	78.69414706212534
<SOS> `` aha ! '' <EOS>	71.40960869276871
<SOS> continued d'artagnan , `` it is clear that they are afraid of something or other ; for look , the sentinels are being reinforced . <EOS>	97.20572745359817
<SOS> they had only halberds before , now they have muskets . <EOS>	64.19624115513876
<SOS> the halberds were for the audience in the rear ; the muskets are for us . '' <EOS>	66.91608517615597
<SOS> `` thirty , forty , fifty , sixty five men , '' said porthos , counting the reinforcements . <EOS>	70.85641950679683
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	83.47314115696484
<SOS> said aramis , `` but you forget the officer . '' <EOS>	85.24770821829487
<SOS> d'artagnan grew pale with rage . <EOS>	57.19440693577268
<SOS> he recognized mordaunt , who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches . <EOS>	111.48939159012056
<SOS> `` do you think they have recognized us ? '' <EOS>	68.00573950447608
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	48.38982977841809
<SOS> `` in that case i should beat a retreat . <EOS>	56.666729891023024
<SOS> i do n't care to be shot in a box . '' <EOS>	88.69654874743385
<SOS> `` no , '' said aramis , `` he has not seen us . <EOS>	74.81024849767995
<SOS> he sees no one but the king . <EOS>	82.0652375608485
<SOS> mon dieu ! <EOS>	51.74048947171667
<SOS> how he stares at him , the insolent dog ! <EOS>	101.77342159363113
<SOS> does he hate his majesty as much as he does us ? '' <EOS>	86.4192727073212
<SOS> `` pardi , '' answered athos `` we only carried off his mother ; the king has spoiled him of his name and property . '' <EOS>	102.72167471182506
<SOS> `` true , '' said aramis ; `` but silence ! <EOS>	83.16501594777188
<SOS> the president is speaking to the king . '' <EOS>	48.75194479328686
<SOS> `` stuart , '' bradshaw was saying , `` listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make . '' <EOS>	88.73994895283442
<SOS> the king turned his head away , as if these words had not been intended for him . <EOS>	90.23107675479608
<SOS> bradshaw waited , and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence . <EOS>	101.33601251705473
<SOS> out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present , for the rest , fearful of taking part in such an act , had remained away . <EOS>	76.52594112350279
<SOS> when the name of colonel fairfax was called , one of those brief but solemn silences ensued , which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial . <EOS>	92.96197796637709
<SOS> `` colonel fairfax , '' repeated bradshaw . <EOS>	97.673142160906
<SOS> `` fairfax , '' answered a laughing voice , the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman , `` is not such a fool as to be here . '' <EOS>	103.52929731928465
<SOS> a loud laugh followed these words , pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance . <EOS>	103.17454328348529
<SOS> `` it is a woman 's voice , '' cried aramis ; `` faith , i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty . '' <EOS>	102.15432116904954
<SOS> and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her . <EOS>	58.584955034003016
<SOS> `` by my soul , '' said aramis , `` she is charming . <EOS>	70.22175910206131
<SOS> look d'artagnan ; everybody is looking at her ; and in spite of bradshaw 's gaze she has not turned pale . '' <EOS>	103.45631461874942
<SOS> `` it is lady fairfax herself , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	84.61960620295505
<SOS> `` do n't you remember , porthos , we saw her at general cromwell 's ? '' <EOS>	88.8420350488206
<SOS> the roll call continued . <EOS>	57.995886200789734
<SOS> `` these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force , '' said the comte de la fere . <EOS>	85.07585602481996
<SOS> `` you do n't know them . <EOS>	47.779892814697185
<SOS> athos , look at mordaunt 's smile . <EOS>	97.2879557063348
<SOS> is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him ? <EOS>	114.37781589889137
<SOS> ah , cursed basilisk , it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you . '' <EOS>	62.19749229062059
<SOS> `` the king is really very handsome , '' said porthos ; `` and look , too , though he is a prisoner , how carefully he is dressed . <EOS>	74.39003194821065
<SOS> the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles . <EOS>	109.33330598727518
<SOS> look at it , aramis . '' <EOS>	90.93097561277392
<SOS> the roll call finished , the president ordered them to read the act of accusation . <EOS>	82.72844173294133
<SOS> athos turned pale . <EOS>	40.50248816292936
<SOS> a second time he was disappointed in his expectation . <EOS>	92.46219488251445
<SOS> notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue ; the king then , was condemned in advance . <EOS>	88.17033181165401
<SOS> `` i told you so , athos , '' said d'artagnan , shrugging his shoulders . <EOS>	87.59535441505221
<SOS> `` now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign , with full license and privilege . '' <EOS>	79.89634087040672
<SOS> never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty . <EOS>	99.98571325022596
<SOS> charles listened with marked attention , passing over the insults , noting the grievances , and , when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand , replying with a smile of lofty scorn . <EOS>	76.64625813968597
<SOS> `` the fact is , '' said d'artagnan , `` if men are punished for imprudence and triviality , this poor king deserves punishment . <EOS>	66.90469265137786
<SOS> but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough . '' <EOS>	49.4399452902975
<SOS> `` in any case , '' aramis replied , `` the punishment should fall not on the king , but on his ministers ; for the first article of the constitution is , 'the king can do no wrong . ' '' <EOS>	83.27607579663135
<SOS> `` as for me , '' thought porthos , giving mordaunt his whole attention , `` were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench , reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him ; i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france . <EOS>	45.6668839770481
<SOS> meantime , d'artagnan , who is full of invention , would find some way to save the king . <EOS>	99.12873394453615
<SOS> i must speak to him about it . '' <EOS>	57.43125477097074
<SOS> as to athos , his face aflame , his fists clinched , his lips bitten till they bled , he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience ; the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement . <EOS>	90.19842120098863
<SOS> at this moment the accuser concluded with these words : `` the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people . '' <EOS>	58.54612726533732
<SOS> at these words there was a murmur along the benches , and a second voice , not that of a woman , but a man 's , stout and furious , thundered behind d'artagnan . <EOS>	94.14293443402008
<SOS> `` you lie ! '' <EOS>	87.47652348863082
<SOS> it cried . <EOS>	68.233108838854
<SOS> `` nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say . '' <EOS>	80.84292337329985
<SOS> this voice was that of athos , who , standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind , thus assailed the public accuser . <EOS>	68.72732989181019
<SOS> king , judges , spectators , all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated . <EOS>	61.1429007491208
<SOS> mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman , around whom the three other frenchmen were standing , pale and menacing . <EOS>	89.55125022857065
<SOS> his eyes glittered with delight . <EOS>	60.169518058027684
<SOS> he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life . <EOS>	45.36979032115656
<SOS> a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers , and pointing to the bench where his enemies were : `` fire on that bench ! '' <EOS>	62.66092974930931
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	57.38467286861412
<SOS> but with the rapidity of thought d'artagnan seized athos by the waist , and followed by porthos with aramis , leaped down from the benches , rushed into the passages , and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without , while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators , whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed . <EOS>	86.74150892600063
<SOS> charles also had recognized the four frenchmen . <EOS>	80.39082630516282
<SOS> he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes , that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends . <EOS>	84.551650808581
<SOS> mordaunt , pale and trembling with anger , rushed from the hall sword in hand , followed by six pikemen , pushing , inquiring and panting in the crowd ; and then , having found nothing , returned . <EOS>	57.134978469015195
<SOS> the tumult was indescribable . <EOS>	83.27778104509326
<SOS> more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard . <EOS>	85.52036305237776
<SOS> the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches . <EOS>	67.01932839696937
<SOS> the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them , and divided between fear and curiosity , remained noisy and excited . <EOS>	52.44690278354173
<SOS> quiet was at length restored . <EOS>	53.828266093618744
<SOS> `` what have you to say in your defense ? '' <EOS>	54.7603071007725
<SOS> asked bradshaw of the king . <EOS>	71.78168262395326
<SOS> then rising , with his head still covered , in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner , charles began . <EOS>	102.17665231911542
<SOS> `` before questioning me , '' he said , `` reply to my question . <EOS>	53.54922831075262
<SOS> i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses . <EOS>	115.43850391063465
<SOS> instead of performing your part of this contract , as i performed mine , you bought me from the scotch , cheaply , i know , and that does honor to the economic talent of your government . <EOS>	77.49249941303542
<SOS> but because you have paid the price of a slave , do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king ? <EOS>	67.50483973115706
<SOS> no . <EOS>	54.25345237765815
<SOS> to answer you would be to forget it . <EOS>	89.9009130084025
<SOS> i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me . <EOS>	57.072207289531285
<SOS> to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges , and i only acknowledge you as my executioners . '' <EOS>	100.59319285157295
<SOS> and in the middle of a deathlike silence , charles , calm , lofty , and with his head still covered , sat down again in his arm chair . <EOS>	83.82182803518928
<SOS> `` why are not my frenchmen here ? '' <EOS>	58.27053998528072
<SOS> he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; `` they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead . '' <EOS>	68.64878860867306
<SOS> `` well , '' said the president , seeing that charles was determined to remain silent , `` so be it . <EOS>	59.54321545078271
<SOS> we will judge you in spite of your silence . <EOS>	78.35868340794123
<SOS> you are accused of treason , of abuse of power , and murder . <EOS>	47.84166662274065
<SOS> the evidence will support it . <EOS>	91.48223377538778
<SOS> go , and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this . '' <EOS>	70.08716062172903
<SOS> charles rose and turned toward parry , whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture . <EOS>	81.78172915969093
<SOS> `` well , my dear parry , '' said he , `` what is the matter , and what can affect you in this manner ? '' <EOS>	62.76565382049111
<SOS> `` oh , my king , '' said parry , with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication , `` do not look to the left as we leave the hall . '' <EOS>	107.0782111747776
<SOS> `` and why , parry ? '' <EOS>	41.867584873756485
<SOS> `` do not look , i implore you , my king . '' <EOS>	107.6219624617409
<SOS> `` but what is the matter ? <EOS>	52.72020398546965
<SOS> speak , '' said charles , attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him . <EOS>	108.635384361622
<SOS> `` it is but you will not look , will you ? <EOS>	96.08484817318326
<SOS> it is because they have had the axe , with which criminals are executed , brought and placed there on the table . <EOS>	79.24900075536138
<SOS> the sight is hideous . '' <EOS>	64.83598896104654
<SOS> `` fools , '' said charles , `` do they take me for a coward , like themselves ? <EOS>	66.02120575155774
<SOS> you have done well to warn me . <EOS>	44.01718031364442
<SOS> thank you , parry . '' <EOS>	69.56457877986571
<SOS> when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall . <EOS>	65.01134886521783
<SOS> as he passed the table on which the axe was laid , he stopped , and turning with a smile , said : `` ah ! <EOS>	70.34386837327158
<SOS> the axe , an ingenious device , and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is ; you frighten me not , executioner 's axe , '' added he , touching it with the cane which he held in his hand , `` and i strike you now , waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow . '' <EOS>	76.11415791929258
<SOS> and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on . <EOS>	61.66865720962631
<SOS> when he reached the door a stream of people , who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out , stood on each side , as he passed , many among them glaring on him with threatening looks . <EOS>	73.73917365383194
<SOS> `` how many people , '' thought he , `` and not one true friend . '' <EOS>	76.01800459397279
<SOS> and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind , a voice beside him said : `` respect to fallen majesty . '' <EOS>	61.2090476339924
<SOS> the king turned quickly around , with tears in his eyes and heart . <EOS>	79.74657832756895
<SOS> it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage . <EOS>	63.591062211862365
<SOS> but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts , and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow . <EOS>	89.86984127553224
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	60.566162324716885
<SOS> said charles , `` that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault . '' <EOS>	109.48123578678698
<SOS> he continued his walk , but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces , when a furious fellow , leaning between two soldiers , spat in the king 's face , as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth . <EOS>	65.64951896748018
<SOS> loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together . <EOS>	99.52367803675781
<SOS> the crowd opened and closed again , undulating like a stormy sea , and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos . <EOS>	102.6582393938556
<SOS> charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile : `` poor wretch , for half a crown he would do as much to his own father . '' <EOS>	76.12470972854949
<SOS> the king was not mistaken . <EOS>	57.534356355462236
<SOS> athos and his friends , again mingling with the throng , were taking a last look at the martyr king . <EOS>	48.57180635086706
<SOS> when the soldier saluted charles , athos 's heart bounded for joy ; and that unfortunate , on coming to himself , found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket . <EOS>	86.57409215621719
<SOS> but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger . <EOS>	59.86091438869732
<SOS> but d'artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried , `` wait ! '' <EOS>	60.57295693279895
<SOS> athos stopped . <EOS>	58.24920933479584
<SOS> d'artagnan , leaning on athos , made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms , who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others . <EOS>	60.40316157558459
<SOS> the man took his way toward the city . <EOS>	70.9523841405853
<SOS> the four friends followed him . <EOS>	63.838481272946886
<SOS> the man , who had the appearance of being a butcher , descended a little steep and isolated street , looking on to the river , with two of his friends . <EOS>	79.45704820668904
<SOS> arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed , turned around , and looking insolently at the frenchmen , passed some jests from one to another . <EOS>	48.328381462883584
<SOS> `` i do n't know english , athos , '' said d'artagnan ; `` but you know it and will interpret for me . '' <EOS>	84.57965124762529
<SOS> then quickening their steps they passed the three men , but turned back immediately , and d'artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger , said to athos : `` say this to him in english : 'you are a coward . <EOS>	97.61242682152263
<SOS> you have insulted a defenseless man . <EOS>	80.35180044384202
<SOS> you have befouled the face of your king . <EOS>	76.68862456769031
<SOS> you must die . ' '' <EOS>	104.54759382992883
<SOS> athos , pale as a ghost , repeated these words to the man , who , seeing the bodeful preparations that were making , put himself in an attitude of defense . <EOS>	58.45404648372693
<SOS> aramis , at this movement , drew his sword . <EOS>	65.354640514321
<SOS> `` no , '' cried d'artagnan , `` no steel . <EOS>	58.09546619712033
<SOS> steel is for gentlemen . '' <EOS>	61.353365986963
<SOS> and seizing the butcher by the throat : `` porthos , '' said he , `` kill this fellow for me with a single blow . '' <EOS>	58.90809592381131
<SOS> porthos raised his terrible fist , which whistled through the air like a sling , and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter 's skull and crushed it . <EOS>	117.95162764789701
<SOS> the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe . <EOS>	72.80543549935285
<SOS> his companions , horror struck , could neither move nor cry out . <EOS>	70.81796182987642
<SOS> `` tell them this , athos , '' resumed d'artagnan ; `` thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord . '' <EOS>	62.19599793073831
<SOS> athos repeated d'artagnan 's words . <EOS>	67.57159910014279
<SOS> the fellows looked at the body of their companion , swimming in blood , and then recovering voice and legs together , ran screaming off . <EOS>	79.03208550952624
<SOS> `` justice is done , '' said porthos , wiping his forehead . <EOS>	77.7594915423056
<SOS> `` and now , '' said d'artagnan to athos , `` entertain no further doubts about me ; i undertake all that concerns the king . '' <EOS>	103.52829641261792
<SOS> chapter lxiv . <EOS>	76.55960705979165
<SOS> whitehall . <EOS>	74.447792628199
<SOS> the parliament condemned charles to death , as might have been foreseen . <EOS>	101.8141367261046
<SOS> political judgments are generally vain formalities , for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation . <EOS>	79.28237810352749
<SOS> such is the atrocious logic of revolutions . <EOS>	62.61820081096388
<SOS> although our friends were expecting that condemnation , it filled them with grief . <EOS>	78.2159475150562
<SOS> d'artagnan , whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies , swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy . <EOS>	95.0698483206635
<SOS> but by what means ? <EOS>	103.81493279496242
<SOS> as yet he could form no definite plan ; all must depend on circumstances . <EOS>	50.45002963012826
<SOS> meanwhile , it was necessary at all hazards , in order to gain time , to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges . <EOS>	62.957494583808156
<SOS> the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner . <EOS>	72.20981716998496
<SOS> the headsman out of the way , the sentence could not be executed . <EOS>	90.72644626778334
<SOS> true , they could send for the headsman of the nearest town , but at least a day would be gained , and a day might be sufficient for the rescue . <EOS>	74.79063762693808
<SOS> d'artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task . <EOS>	88.42555325584405
<SOS> another thing , not less essential , was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made , so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible , or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts . <EOS>	54.090982177534705
<SOS> aramis assumed that perilous charge . <EOS>	103.15222227205122
<SOS> charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him . <EOS>	85.59316506775382
<SOS> mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell 's permission . <EOS>	78.09055464048302
<SOS> aramis determined to obtain from the bishop , through fear or by persuasion , consent that he should enter in the bishop 's place , and clad in his sacerdotal robes , the prison at whitehall . <EOS>	96.15018670734626
<SOS> finally , athos undertook to provide , in any event , the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success . <EOS>	70.55386116919713
<SOS> the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o'clock at the hotel , and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission . <EOS>	73.05379777707348
<SOS> the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell , who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually . <EOS>	63.42928387619824
<SOS> alone in his usual room , lighted by two candles , the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness , just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore . <EOS>	72.27493541615569
<SOS> parry had not quitted his master , and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep . <EOS>	48.937143683482056
<SOS> charles , leaning on a table , was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter ; he was waiting first for juxon , then for martyrdom . <EOS>	96.87573779996102
<SOS> at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal , like the forms that appear in dreams . <EOS>	71.10139067167886
<SOS> in fact , he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream , or at least the delirium of a fever . <EOS>	69.48721993463944
<SOS> he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window ; he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards . <EOS>	103.96047052050038
<SOS> he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real . <EOS>	61.01085130263478
<SOS> charles returned in silence to his chair , rested his elbow on the table , bowed his head upon his hand and reflected . <EOS>	67.07211576619048
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	76.6257594104133
<SOS> he said to himself , `` if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church , whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life , all the littlenesses of greatness , perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul . <EOS>	64.08533892072752
<SOS> but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind , whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune . <EOS>	48.2121501870382
<SOS> he will speak to me of god and death , as he has spoken to many another dying man , not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper , his children to the cold contempt of public charity . '' <EOS>	95.40758762199681
<SOS> and he raised the medallion to his lips . <EOS>	109.80120941872151
<SOS> it was a dull , foggy night . <EOS>	78.61038159685629
<SOS> a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour . <EOS>	59.68512933042744
<SOS> the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room . <EOS>	61.577419480326725
<SOS> these were the ancestors of charles , standing back dimly in their tarnished frames . <EOS>	48.8962776388409
<SOS> an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles . <EOS>	83.92109155171616
<SOS> he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world , so beautiful when one is about to leave it ; of the caresses of children , so pleasing and so sweet , especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again ; then of his wife , the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment . <EOS>	110.52024447237864
<SOS> he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen ; he kissed it , and then , as he reflected , that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb , there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death . <EOS>	88.38802810996833
<SOS> then , in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs , whither had come so many courtiers , the scene of so much flattering homage , alone with a despairing servant , whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own , the king at last yielded to sorrow , and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness , those shadows , and that wintry cold . <EOS>	74.86536917699657
<SOS> that king , who was so grand , so sublime in the hour of death , meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips , now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth . <EOS>	106.49360351262739
<SOS> suddenly the door opened , an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered , followed by two guards , to whom the king waved an imperious gesture . <EOS>	70.45522672621472
<SOS> the guards retired ; the room resumed its obscurity . <EOS>	65.05803066966284
<SOS> `` juxon ! '' <EOS>	87.10621676285739
<SOS> cried charles , `` juxon , thank you , my last friend ; you come at a fitting moment . '' <EOS>	107.84298245796423
<SOS> the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle nook . <EOS>	97.8334622454618
<SOS> `` come , parry , '' said the king , `` cease your tears . '' <EOS>	98.46302316224215
<SOS> `` if it 's parry , '' said the bishop , `` i have nothing to fear ; so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come . '' <EOS>	111.86091038901063
<SOS> at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out , when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england . <EOS>	92.96467064335825
<SOS> `` the chevalier ! '' <EOS>	42.15472155214602
<SOS> murmured charles . <EOS>	71.79878717447322
<SOS> `` yes , sire , '' interrupted aramis , raising his voice , `` bishop juxon , the faithful knight of christ , obedient to your majesty 's wishes . '' <EOS>	71.5446185155961
<SOS> charles clasped his hands , amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners , without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them , thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king . <EOS>	83.60509882009599
<SOS> `` you ! '' <EOS>	72.68351770958395
<SOS> he said , `` you ! <EOS>	82.78542393613124
<SOS> how did you penetrate hither ? <EOS>	69.22640336974284
<SOS> if they recognize you , you are lost . '' <EOS>	66.37440913113068
<SOS> `` care not for me , sire ; think only of yourself . <EOS>	51.273913637039875
<SOS> you see , your friends are wakeful . <EOS>	69.32276660771724
<SOS> i know not what we shall do yet , but four determined men can do much . <EOS>	81.86299733168009
<SOS> meanwhile , do not be surprised at anything that happens ; prepare yourself for every emergency . '' <EOS>	46.053048729678125
<SOS> charles shook his head . <EOS>	89.18531131666309
<SOS> `` do you know that i die to morrow at ten o'clock ? '' <EOS>	72.19926288858868
<SOS> `` something , your majesty , will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible . '' <EOS>	95.31391726027198
<SOS> the king looked at aramis with astonishment . <EOS>	107.87174495375258
<SOS> at this moment a strange noise , like the unloading of a cart , and followed by a cry of pain , was heard beneath the window . <EOS>	58.425796774311124
<SOS> `` do you hear ? '' <EOS>	89.67224207987447
<SOS> said the king . <EOS>	58.74361845181389
<SOS> `` i hear , '' said aramis , `` but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain . '' <EOS>	99.54506381457439
<SOS> `` i know not who can have uttered the cry , '' said the king , `` but the noise is easily understood . <EOS>	85.29933720094891
<SOS> do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window ? <EOS>	76.38607117497224
<SOS> well , these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold . <EOS>	84.57671937165132
<SOS> some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt . '' <EOS>	81.47184370245556
<SOS> aramis shuddered in spite of himself . <EOS>	81.18113691874636
<SOS> `` you see , '' said the king , `` that it is useless for you to resist . <EOS>	78.52881226148006
<SOS> i am condemned ; leave me to my death . '' <EOS>	77.36797547507963
<SOS> `` my king , '' said aramis , `` they well may raise a scaffold , but they can not make an executioner . '' <EOS>	54.48078941724099
<SOS> `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	48.231636388366866
<SOS> asked the king . <EOS>	52.24473851835277
<SOS> `` i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion . <EOS>	65.68960472181182
<SOS> the scaffold will be ready by to morrow , but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow . '' <EOS>	63.98766490720754
<SOS> `` what then ? '' <EOS>	99.10345111233724
<SOS> said the king . <EOS>	57.06201802976898
<SOS> `` to morrow night we shall rescue you . '' <EOS>	102.66412279092803
<SOS> `` how can that be ? '' <EOS>	68.80142198810435
<SOS> cried the king , whose face was lighted up , in spite of himself , by a flash of joy . <EOS>	68.87780658890483
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	63.405138036579395
<SOS> sir , '' cried parry , `` may you and yours be blessed ! '' <EOS>	75.96078463944933
<SOS> `` how can it be ? '' <EOS>	65.72650677556129
<SOS> repeated the king . <EOS>	71.33454699568259
<SOS> `` i must know , so that i may assist you if there is any chance . '' <EOS>	52.93894379419864
<SOS> `` i know nothing about it , '' continued aramis , `` but the cleverest , the bravest , the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him , 'tell the king that to morrow at ten o'clock at night , we shall carry him off . ' <EOS>	80.18050520646446
<SOS> he has said it and will do it . '' <EOS>	70.99240002624886
<SOS> `` tell me the name of that generous friend , '' said the king , `` that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude , whether he succeeds or not . '' <EOS>	39.44661484414183
<SOS> `` d'artagnan , sire , the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance . '' <EOS>	55.45920778700541
<SOS> `` you are , indeed , wonderful men , '' said the king ; `` if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them . '' <EOS>	60.798473118014186
<SOS> `` now , sire , '' resumed aramis , `` listen to me . <EOS>	99.3455035915712
<SOS> do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety ; observe the smallest gesture , the least bit of song , the least sign from any one near you ; watch everything , hear everything , interpret everything . '' <EOS>	45.367864105122905
<SOS> `` oh , chevalier ! '' <EOS>	60.06426322674081
<SOS> cried the king , `` what can i say to you ? <EOS>	68.98059084940769
<SOS> there is no word , though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart , that can express my gratitude . <EOS>	100.46221974006485
<SOS> if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king ; no , in presence of the scaffold as i am , royalty , i assure you , is a very small affair ; but you will save a husband to his wife , a father to his children . <EOS>	67.01459141033517
<SOS> chevalier , take my hand ; it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh . '' <EOS>	76.8583923001983
<SOS> aramis stooped to kiss the king 's hand , but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart . <EOS>	76.95229496986248
<SOS> at this moment a man entered , without even knocking at the door . <EOS>	101.8741913034849
<SOS> aramis tried to withdraw his hand , but the king still held it . <EOS>	70.6438026365854
<SOS> the man was one of those puritans , half preacher and half soldier , who swarmed around cromwell . <EOS>	48.97248470293607
<SOS> `` what do you want , sir ? '' <EOS>	99.65861307804785
<SOS> said the king . <EOS>	77.3192309041451
<SOS> `` i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end ? '' <EOS>	117.44633898349254
<SOS> said the stranger . <EOS>	43.38753006612151
<SOS> `` and what is it to you ? '' <EOS>	46.49616189559389
<SOS> replied the king ; `` we are not of the same religion . '' <EOS>	76.67905598679559
<SOS> `` all men are brothers , '' said the puritan . <EOS>	64.11760056541677
<SOS> `` one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him . '' <EOS>	81.8236750034288
<SOS> `` bear with him , '' whispered aramis ; `` it is doubtless some spy . '' <EOS>	69.03699750065798
<SOS> `` after my reverend lord bishop , '' said the king to the man , `` i shall hear you with pleasure , sir . '' <EOS>	85.60984576805632
<SOS> the man retired , but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king . <EOS>	80.39170070721492
<SOS> `` chevalier , '' said the king , when the door was closed , `` i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions . <EOS>	82.61567691519197
<SOS> take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave . '' <EOS>	63.26112411293934
<SOS> `` i thank your majesty , '' said aramis , `` but under these robes i have a coat of mail , a pistol and a dagger . '' <EOS>	44.834555053072535
<SOS> `` go , then , sir , and god keep you ! '' <EOS>	72.40961053344178
<SOS> the king accompanied him to the door , where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him , and passing through the ante rooms , filled with soldiers , jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop 's palace . <EOS>	67.75065164707587
<SOS> juxon was waiting for him impatiently . <EOS>	59.60463134153129
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	60.70209451847293
<SOS> said he , on perceiving aramis . <EOS>	61.19642664741066
<SOS> `` everything has succeeded as i expected ; spies , guards , satellites , all took me for you , and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him . '' <EOS>	60.61572545556548
<SOS> `` may god protect you , my son ; for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage . '' <EOS>	70.42236913699222
<SOS> aramis resumed his own attire and left juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him . <EOS>	67.114717479887
<SOS> he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man , wrapped in a large cloak . <EOS>	108.58442222496338
<SOS> he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped . <EOS>	108.45395391790014
<SOS> the man came straight toward him . <EOS>	68.89365469124986
<SOS> it was porthos . <EOS>	84.16318257826788
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' cried aramis . <EOS>	83.0324476451808
<SOS> `` you see , we had each our mission , '' said porthos ; `` mine was to guard you and i am doing so . <EOS>	89.03940499354864
<SOS> have you seen the king ? '' <EOS>	63.867531391790735
<SOS> `` yes , and all goes well . '' <EOS>	107.04268342456182
<SOS> `` we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven . '' <EOS>	54.20393698356746
<SOS> it was then striking half past ten by st. paul 's . <EOS>	98.22702890105616
<SOS> arrived at the hotel it was not long before athos entered . <EOS>	75.87668227676667
<SOS> `` all 's well , '' he cried , as he entered ; `` i have hired a cedar wherry , as light as a canoe , as easy on the wing as any swallow . <EOS>	89.5512456381116
<SOS> it is waiting for us at greenwich , opposite the isle of dogs , manned by a captain and four men , who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights . <EOS>	97.33211273955762
<SOS> once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea . <EOS>	69.82213539998992
<SOS> in case i am killed , the captain 's name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning . <EOS>	45.7584502858269
<SOS> a handkerchief , tied at the four corners , is to be the signal . '' <EOS>	120.50502233790426
<SOS> next moment d'artagnan entered . <EOS>	102.38781173141871
<SOS> `` empty your pockets , '' said he ; `` i want a hundred pounds , and as for my own `` and he emptied them inside out . <EOS>	66.44058478443182
<SOS> the sum was collected in a minute . <EOS>	75.41090918023775
<SOS> d'artagnan ran out and returned directly after . <EOS>	51.117529891955826
<SOS> `` there , '' said he , `` it 's done . <EOS>	78.5071132917323
<SOS> ough ! <EOS>	64.03617175286372
<SOS> and not without a deal of trouble , too . '' <EOS>	94.5669744046437
<SOS> `` has the executioner left london ? '' <EOS>	86.11771113505965
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	73.1000296408479
<SOS> `` ah , you see that plan was not sure enough ; he might go out by one gate and return by another . '' <EOS>	93.29002613213812
<SOS> `` where is he , then ? '' <EOS>	65.5479807440121
<SOS> `` in the cellar . '' <EOS>	58.16162555832318
<SOS> `` the cellar what cellar ? '' <EOS>	57.925150720768166
<SOS> `` our landlord 's , to be sure . <EOS>	88.20689707201944
<SOS> mousqueton is propped against the door and here 's the key . '' <EOS>	49.66090265880517
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	72.86742251659427
<SOS> said aramis , `` how did you manage it ? '' <EOS>	87.39413177798315
<SOS> `` like everything else , with money ; but it cost me dear . '' <EOS>	43.49177697335747
<SOS> `` how much ? '' <EOS>	59.419132084381204
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	77.06864465387564
<SOS> `` five hundred pounds . '' <EOS>	99.05678221219478
<SOS> `` and where did you get so much money ? '' <EOS>	79.75534321250332
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	51.60186851019195
<SOS> `` had you , then , that sum ? '' <EOS>	75.273723823072
<SOS> `` the queen 's famous diamond , '' answered d'artagnan , with a sigh . <EOS>	56.662193600182334
<SOS> `` ah , true , '' said aramis . <EOS>	51.257872096236305
<SOS> `` i recognized it on your finger . '' <EOS>	93.83321952996717
<SOS> `` you bought it back , then , from monsieur des essarts ? '' <EOS>	109.95684818689757
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	108.86561172732095
<SOS> `` yes , but it was fated that i should not keep it . '' <EOS>	52.283679532636306
<SOS> `` so , then , we are all right as regards the executioner , '' said athos ; `` but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant , his man , or whatever you call him . '' <EOS>	56.384498173973434
<SOS> `` and this one had his , '' said d'artagnan ; `` but , as good luck would have it , just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage , our friend was brought home with a broken leg . <EOS>	72.15302589630711
<SOS> in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king 's window , and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it . '' <EOS>	61.38703637769067
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	88.72892069111924
<SOS> cried aramis , `` that accounts for the cry i heard . '' <EOS>	61.19748726522155
<SOS> `` probably , '' said d'artagnan , `` but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold , and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe , an assistant carpenter and friend of his , to go down to whitehall , with three of his friends . <EOS>	52.17128403464716
<SOS> here 's the letter he sent by a messenger , for sixpence , who sold it to me for a guinea . '' <EOS>	68.093378875782
<SOS> `` and what on earth are you going to do with it ? '' <EOS>	67.11245943305049
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	96.53888257268586
<SOS> `` ca n't you guess , my dear athos ? <EOS>	66.79210262204741
<SOS> you , who speak english like john bull himself , are master tom lowe , we , your three companions . <EOS>	53.68164778802598
<SOS> do you understand it now ? '' <EOS>	77.82830540636111
<SOS> athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration , ran to a closet and drew forth workmen 's clothes , which the four friends immediately put on ; they then left the hotel , athos carrying a saw , porthos a vise , aramis an axe and d'artagnan a hammer and some nails . <EOS>	57.82926655588867
<SOS> the letter from the executioner 's assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected . <EOS>	73.46274161996338
<SOS> chapter lxv . <EOS>	58.92307276279325
<SOS> the workmen . <EOS>	76.8413569957105
<SOS> toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window . <EOS>	100.4861873260721
<SOS> it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet , clinking of pincers and cranching of saws . <EOS>	54.52119332610333
<SOS> lying dressed upon his bed , the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart . <EOS>	65.41439646907332
<SOS> he could not endure it , and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king . <EOS>	39.11264233863779
<SOS> the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post , but allowed parry to pass . <EOS>	69.21050726812372
<SOS> arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold , over which they were nailing a covering of black serge . <EOS>	45.27622306299345
<SOS> raised to the height of twenty feet , so as to be on a level with the window , it had two lower stories . <EOS>	44.53712464731063
<SOS> parry , odious as was this sight to him , sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise ; and fixed on two men , who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony . <EOS>	71.88049843943973
<SOS> `` my friends , '' said parry , mounting the scaffold and standing beside them , `` would you work a little more quietly ? <EOS>	86.58382900566203
<SOS> the king wishes to get a sleep . '' <EOS>	58.67454218758219
<SOS> one of the two , who was standing up , was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall , whilst the other , kneeling beside him , was collecting the pieces of stone . <EOS>	63.82009329821286
<SOS> the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness ; but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement . <EOS>	93.93248705108954
<SOS> `` very well , very well , '' said the workman aloud , in excellent english . <EOS>	82.71593735974571
<SOS> `` tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night . '' <EOS>	71.73166302411248
<SOS> these blunt words , so terrible if taken literally , were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter . <EOS>	52.55595509412555
<SOS> but parry withdrew , thinking he was dreaming . <EOS>	77.19419542721388
<SOS> charles was impatiently awaiting his return . <EOS>	77.34978385149657
<SOS> at the moment he re entered , the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening , curious as to what the king was doing . <EOS>	64.62151396566675
<SOS> the king was lying on his bed , resting on his elbow . <EOS>	52.4836884470926
<SOS> parry closed the door and approaching the king , his face radiant with joy : `` sire , '' he said , in a low voice , `` do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise ? '' <EOS>	58.004120153280084
<SOS> `` i ? <EOS>	76.1455836840979
<SOS> no ; how would you have me know ? '' <EOS>	53.664990528363084
<SOS> parry bent his head and whispered to the king : `` it is the comte de la fere and his friends . '' <EOS>	62.48884161312135
<SOS> `` raising my scaffold ! '' <EOS>	70.1287403376161
<SOS> cried the king , astounded . <EOS>	63.72764167680234
<SOS> `` yes , and at the same time making a hole in the wall . '' <EOS>	104.93007220999773
<SOS> the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven ; then leaping down from his bed he went to the window , and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside , but in vain . <EOS>	49.125886246514
<SOS> parry was not wrong . <EOS>	61.83615913683417
<SOS> it was athos he had recognized , and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall . <EOS>	68.06907834318481
<SOS> this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king 's room and the ceiling of the one below it . <EOS>	91.14291857890052
<SOS> their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king 's room , so as to form a kind of trap door . <EOS>	81.94164354697888
<SOS> through this the king was to escape the next night , and , hidden by the black covering of the scaffold , was to change his dress for that of a workman , slip out with his deliverers , pass the sentinels , who would suspect nothing , and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich . <EOS>	101.22408340078954
<SOS> day gilded the tops of the houses . <EOS>	91.84251087353039
<SOS> the aperture was finished and athos passed through it , carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth , and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king 's room . <EOS>	43.44146148966687
<SOS> he had only two hours ' work to do to open communication with the king and , according to the calculations of the four friends , they had the entire day before them , since , the executioner being absent , another must be sent for to bristol . <EOS>	101.68640820663933
<SOS> d'artagnan returned to change his workman 's clothes for his chestnut colored suit , and porthos to put on his red doublet . <EOS>	48.92525618702418
<SOS> as for aramis , he went off to the bishop 's palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king 's presence . <EOS>	71.12786122077836
<SOS> all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on . <EOS>	90.83295756941034
<SOS> before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king . <EOS>	53.07921840625192
<SOS> `` adieu , then , and be of good courage , '' said athos . <EOS>	69.41057547289572
<SOS> `` report to the king the condition of affairs . <EOS>	59.025106705475885
<SOS> say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor , for then i can continue my work in safety . <EOS>	76.8496075692939

<SOS> `` be easy , '' said aramis ; `` i will take two poniards and give one to parry . <EOS>	86.9851208990189
<SOS> is that all ? '' <EOS>	82.39993188352975
<SOS> `` yes , go ; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity . <EOS>	93.08754223417029

<SOS> the trap once replaced over his head , you being on the trap , dead or alive , they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped . <EOS>	100.49983592648024

<SOS> `` everything shall be done as you say , athos . <EOS>	74.44810743270067
<SOS> your hand , for perhaps we shall not see each other again . '' <EOS>	75.03683501224027
<SOS> athos put his arm around aramis 's neck and embraced him . <EOS>	49.79468957216083
<SOS> `` for you , '' he said . <EOS>	63.84435952946203
<SOS> `` now if i die , say to d'artagnan that i love him as a son , and embrace him for me . <EOS>	87.45991623024173

<SOS> adieu . '' <EOS>	54.94818116180874
<SOS> `` adieu , '' said aramis . <EOS>	83.690413072673
<SOS> `` i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world . '' <EOS>	44.27404367295682
<SOS> aramis parted from athos , went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel , whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell . <EOS>	64.82070971357525
<SOS> he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire , drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken . <EOS>	69.49239194613665
<SOS> porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians ; d'artagnan ate in silence , revolving in his mind the most audacious plans . <EOS>	74.15180372574835
<SOS> aramis related what had been agreed upon . <EOS>	51.09428410100279
<SOS> d'artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice . <EOS>	68.06821238289338
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	98.05289483928588
<SOS> he said ; `` besides , we shall be there at the time of the flight . <EOS>	81.51303191188849
<SOS> what with d'artagnan , grimaud and mousqueton , we can manage to dispatch eight of them . <EOS>	74.85398575038366

<SOS> mousqueton will lose another , that 's five ; and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league . '' <EOS>	94.8142238169471
<SOS> aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful , gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes . <EOS>	101.33147339781844
<SOS> `` now , '' said he , `` i 'm off to the bishop 's . <EOS>	67.89349760717764

<SOS> `` well , do n't be inactive . '' <EOS>	44.92714151979878

<SOS> i pass my life upon my legs . '' <EOS>	63.93523209586528
<SOS> aramis again presented himself at the bishop 's . <EOS>	60.534472821791596
<SOS> juxon consented the more readily to take him with him , as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate . <EOS>	67.4058174515709
<SOS> dressed as aramis had been the night before , the bishop got into his carriage , and the former , more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon 's dress , got in by his side . <EOS>	107.73134987355101
<SOS> the carriage stopped at the door of the palace . <EOS>	79.81826935658412
<SOS> it was about nine o'clock in the morning . <EOS>	83.76304254086625
<SOS> nothing was changed . <EOS>	107.53673128758635
<SOS> the ante rooms were still full of soldiers , the passages still lined by guards . <EOS>	73.56569972047593
<SOS> the king was already sanguine , but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy . <EOS>	81.04623538378779
<SOS> he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis . <EOS>	49.40197574292361
<SOS> the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice , before every one , of their previous interview . <EOS>	91.50246644541565
<SOS> the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit , and that he desired another under the same conditions . <EOS>	63.10350814343755
<SOS> juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king . <EOS>	72.80183706452594
<SOS> every one withdrew . <EOS>	78.93985548167731
<SOS> as soon as the door was closed : `` sire , '' said aramis , speaking rapidly , `` you are saved ; the london executioner has vanished . <EOS>	74.75940700396882
<SOS> his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty 's window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol . '' <EOS>	82.70435400607967
<SOS> `` but the comte de la fere ? '' <EOS>	101.70390695592374
<SOS> asked the king . <EOS>	41.62971538776285
<SOS> `` two feet below you ; take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor . <EOS>	42.663194800657664
<SOS> he will answer you . '' <EOS>	81.30463087925017
<SOS> the king did so , and the moment after , three muffled knocks , answering the given signal , sounded beneath the floor . <EOS>	71.42371106886236
<SOS> `` so , '' said charles , `` he who knocks down there `` `` is the comte de la fere , sire , '' said aramis . <EOS>	95.11133268300951
<SOS> `` he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape . <EOS>	65.39052408996048
<SOS> parry , for his part , will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened . '' <EOS>	63.2249409463823
<SOS> `` oh , juxon , '' said the king , seizing the bishop 's two hands in his own , `` promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet , and for two others also , who , wherever they may be , are on the watch for my safety . '' <EOS>	45.78970007500336
<SOS> `` sire , '' replied juxon , `` you shall be obeyed . '' <EOS>	71.13032411865821
<SOS> meanwhile , the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly , when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage . <EOS>	77.59164942350303
<SOS> aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop ; the noise came nearer and nearer . <EOS>	92.66061833396184
<SOS> it was that of a number of men steadily approaching . <EOS>	58.92356099095279
<SOS> the four men stood motionless . <EOS>	44.553453430545126
<SOS> all eyes were fixed on the door , which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity . <EOS>	64.80317186786809
<SOS> a parliamentary officer , clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill , entered , bowed to the king , and unfolding a parchment , read the sentence , as is usually done to criminals before their execution . <EOS>	50.64126635035063
<SOS> `` what is this ? '' <EOS>	71.00755986844972
<SOS> said aramis to juxon . <EOS>	59.02971230086878
<SOS> juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it . <EOS>	54.60016804313593
<SOS> `` then it is for to day ? '' <EOS>	100.43901103740056
<SOS> asked the king . <EOS>	90.24804601274373
<SOS> `` was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning ? '' <EOS>	72.8427957036931
<SOS> `` then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner ? '' <EOS>	80.42177906553667
<SOS> `` the london executioner has disappeared , your majesty , but a man has offered his services instead . <EOS>	53.510956881110175
<SOS> the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs . '' <EOS>	58.67558720517264
<SOS> a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced , as he learned these tidings . <EOS>	83.5807138813098
<SOS> but aramis was livid . <EOS>	121.6264202368189
<SOS> his heart ceased beating , he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table . <EOS>	74.36175782980737
<SOS> charles perceived it and took his hand . <EOS>	65.75430448674283
<SOS> `` come , my friend , '' said he , `` courage . '' <EOS>	90.71354414880076
<SOS> then he turned to the officer . <EOS>	99.39044714151119
<SOS> `` sir , i am ready . <EOS>	52.51044490567559
<SOS> there is but little reason why i should delay you . <EOS>	83.33605974139601
<SOS> firstly , i wish to communicate ; secondly , to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time . <EOS>	69.1112995786147
<SOS> will this be permitted me ? '' <EOS>	93.46216405151624
<SOS> `` certainly , '' replied the officer , and left the room . <EOS>	71.52231568462123
<SOS> aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud . <EOS>	59.03655373156103
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	60.80689167087805
<SOS> my lord bishop , '' he cried , seizing juxon 's hands , `` where is providence ? <EOS>	115.16082990616816
<SOS> where is providence ? '' <EOS>	58.620147111322396
<SOS> `` my son , '' replied the bishop , with firmness , `` you see him not , because the passions of the world conceal him . '' <EOS>	57.56628817773521
<SOS> `` my son , '' said the king to aramis , `` do not take it so to heart . <EOS>	57.992944698862956
<SOS> you ask what god is doing . <EOS>	72.92232396301334
<SOS> god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom , and believe me , both will have their reward . <EOS>	76.11768115790005
<SOS> ascribe to men , then , what is happening , and not to god . <EOS>	51.51178441798728
<SOS> it is men who drive me to death ; it is men who make you weep . '' <EOS>	71.4778155732857
<SOS> `` yes , sire , '' said aramis , `` yes , you are right . <EOS>	40.667365319939044
<SOS> it is men whom i should hold responsible , and i will hold them responsible . '' <EOS>	93.02471632206392
<SOS> `` be seated , juxon , '' said the king , falling upon his knees . <EOS>	68.14187000036475
<SOS> `` i have now to confess to you . <EOS>	113.0637994912351
<SOS> remain , sir , '' he added to aramis , who had moved to leave the room . <EOS>	84.01602594912481
<SOS> `` remain , parry . <EOS>	55.82702625329926
<SOS> i have nothing to say that can not be said before all . '' <EOS>	64.0176239760056
<SOS> juxon sat down , and the king , kneeling humbly before him , began his confession . <EOS>	106.06092061900385
<SOS> chapter lxvi . <EOS>	45.84804454300583
<SOS> remember ! <EOS>	61.604096303822665
<SOS> the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated . <EOS>	62.689547377860634
<SOS> the king 's children next arrived the princess charlotte , a beautiful , fair haired child , with tears in her eyes , and the duke of gloucester , a boy eight or nine years old , whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride . <EOS>	82.24891194711917
<SOS> he had wept all night long , but would not show his grief before the people . <EOS>	69.25906178843091
<SOS> charles 's heart melted within him at the sight of those two children , whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death . <EOS>	87.01175340275903
<SOS> he turned to brush away a tear , and then , summoning up all his firmness , drew his daughter toward him , recommending her to be pious and resigned . <EOS>	86.41793641687575
<SOS> then he took the boy upon his knee . <EOS>	84.69235067059907
<SOS> `` my son , '' he said to him , `` you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here . <EOS>	121.69570346932174
<SOS> these men are going to behead your father . <EOS>	73.77756916087584
<SOS> do not forget that . <EOS>	97.99770403395247
<SOS> perhaps some day they will want to make you king , instead of the prince of wales , or the duke of york , your elder brothers . <EOS>	48.744541720279905
<SOS> but you are not the king , my son , and can never be so while they are alive . <EOS>	83.78438558737625
<SOS> swear to me , then , never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown . <EOS>	64.52649618048063
<SOS> for one day listen , my son one day , if you do so , they will doom you to destruction , head and crown , too , and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience , as i die . <EOS>	78.87416101807452
<SOS> swear , my son . '' <EOS>	80.7591971453093
<SOS> the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said , `` i swear to your majesty . '' <EOS>	46.711638623111234
<SOS> `` henry , '' said charles , `` call me your father . '' <EOS>	90.97474017020726
<SOS> `` father , '' replied the child , `` i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king . '' <EOS>	86.62697276527514
<SOS> `` good , my child . <EOS>	67.98036691540314
<SOS> now kiss me ; and you , too , charlotte . <EOS>	43.757421979681546
<SOS> never forget me . '' <EOS>	73.61104357415184
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	39.78137039584991
<SOS> never , never ! '' <EOS>	102.0497128151947
<SOS> cried both the children , throwing their arms around their father 's neck . <EOS>	84.04690362675875
<SOS> `` farewell , '' said charles , `` farewell , my children . <EOS>	108.01461048641022
<SOS> take them away , juxon ; their tears will deprive me of the courage to die . '' <EOS>	76.26741088489668
<SOS> juxon led them away , and this time the doors were left open . <EOS>	84.89360278540977
<SOS> meanwhile , athos , in his concealment , waited in vain the signal to recommence his work . <EOS>	115.32800590749669
<SOS> two long hours he waited in terrible inaction . <EOS>	73.09205784938842
<SOS> a deathlike silence reigned in the room above . <EOS>	43.82063990586836
<SOS> at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness . <EOS>	58.18769436673478
<SOS> he crept from his hole and stood , hidden by the black drapery , beneath the scaffold . <EOS>	58.03600998690978
<SOS> peeping out from the drapery , he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea . <EOS>	100.18224861763912
<SOS> `` what is the matter , then ? '' <EOS>	42.72853246425838
<SOS> he asked himself , trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back . <EOS>	89.30246186554342
<SOS> `` the people are hurrying on , the soldiers under arms , and among the spectators i see d'artagnan . <EOS>	44.816621250650165
<SOS> what is he waiting for ? <EOS>	89.29819568928527
<SOS> what is he looking at ? <EOS>	105.11467093524075
<SOS> good god ! <EOS>	83.1388929111765
<SOS> have they allowed the headsman to escape ? '' <EOS>	106.8931281826558
<SOS> suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square . <EOS>	63.294404433911474
<SOS> the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head . <EOS>	79.17042343915014
<SOS> the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession , and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing . <EOS>	66.61053238787915
<SOS> at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words : `` colonel , i want to speak to the people . '' <EOS>	77.71170451001838
<SOS> athos shuddered from head to foot . <EOS>	106.68440673251722
<SOS> it was the king speaking on the scaffold . <EOS>	66.30351759260085
<SOS> in fact , after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread , charles , weary of waiting for death , had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement . <EOS>	68.84418296409095
<SOS> then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open , and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber , first , a masked man , who , carrying an axe in his hand , was recognized as the executioner . <EOS>	88.34972072166732
<SOS> he approached the block and laid his axe upon it . <EOS>	44.82524979130559
<SOS> behind him , pale indeed , but marching with a firm step , was charles stuart , who advanced between two priests , followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold . <EOS>	65.46767503571978
<SOS> the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation . <EOS>	50.44854688596155
<SOS> every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle , when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day . <EOS>	73.79272744628432
<SOS> all gazed at him searchingly . <EOS>	120.31648376876801
<SOS> but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height , dressed in black , apparently of a certain age , for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features . <EOS>	82.33780467817085
<SOS> the king 's request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign , for in firm , sonorous accents , which vibrated in the depths of athos 's heart , the king began his speech , explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom . <EOS>	74.22269432433885
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	61.18158231159576
<SOS> said athos to himself , `` is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see ? <EOS>	122.97307209632483
<SOS> is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably ? <EOS>	66.8389044506331
<SOS> and i have not seen him ! <EOS>	59.973091104497385
<SOS> i have not said adieu to him ! '' <EOS>	82.66159459842909
<SOS> a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block . <EOS>	52.134328496964365
<SOS> `` do not touch the axe , '' said the king , and resumed his speech . <EOS>	78.51012126102161
<SOS> at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people . <EOS>	49.77077051146677
<SOS> then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him , he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon . <EOS>	108.10742222252348
<SOS> then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds , which , like the order , had been the gift of henrietta maria . <EOS>	59.7274138575018
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he to the priest , `` i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment . <EOS>	99.87843846160749
<SOS> take it from me when i am dead . '' <EOS>	67.80535664208337
<SOS> `` yes , sire , '' said a voice , which athos recognized as that of aramis . <EOS>	56.64022499347487
<SOS> he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground . <EOS>	80.73836798463782
<SOS> one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet , took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat . <EOS>	62.469923127761334
<SOS> then , as it was cold , he asked for his gown , which was brought to him . <EOS>	52.463637486207354
<SOS> all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness . <EOS>	58.6563302530786
<SOS> one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin . <EOS>	90.99654310957648
<SOS> `` will these be in your way ? '' <EOS>	63.9895262671334
<SOS> he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; `` if so , they can be tied up . '' <EOS>	49.84746469145236
<SOS> charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman . <EOS>	68.31866351172175
<SOS> his calm , noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head . <EOS>	50.20969420452254
<SOS> but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis . <EOS>	78.4879774389373
<SOS> the king , seeing that he did not reply , repeated his question . <EOS>	90.08620769522437
<SOS> `` it will do , '' replied the man , in a tremulous voice , `` if you separate them across the neck . '' <EOS>	111.50110122860545
<SOS> the king parted his hair with his hands , and looking at the block he said : `` this block is very low , is there no other to be had ? '' <EOS>	91.43640115996158
<SOS> `` it is the usual block , '' answered the man in the mask . <EOS>	48.40702805876859
<SOS> `` do you think you can behead me with a single blow ? '' <EOS>	89.9194696985724
<SOS> asked the king . <EOS>	54.905659071463454
<SOS> `` i hope so , '' was the reply . <EOS>	82.72966147610177
<SOS> there was something so strange in these three words that everybody , except the king , shuddered . <EOS>	64.89503491827271
<SOS> `` i do not wish to be taken by surprise , '' added the king . <EOS>	105.12571640525167
<SOS> `` i shall kneel down to pray ; do not strike then . '' <EOS>	78.84053252237236
<SOS> `` when shall i strike ? '' <EOS>	95.3539563413752
<SOS> `` when i shall lay my head on the block and say 'remember ! ' <EOS>	55.48566685643966
<SOS> then strike boldly . '' <EOS>	92.59337939775797
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the king to those around him , `` i leave you to brave the tempest ; i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms . <EOS>	75.73378505760587
<SOS> farewell . '' <EOS>	57.59938504231957
<SOS> he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head . <EOS>	67.69089840845335
<SOS> `` now , '' he continued , `` withdraw a little and let me say my prayer , i beseech you . <EOS>	45.19287133030964
<SOS> you , also , stand aside , '' he said to the masked man . <EOS>	70.30850596745591
<SOS> `` it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you ; but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal . '' <EOS>	53.79657507357966
<SOS> then he knelt down , made the sign of the cross , and lowering his face to the planks , as if he would have kissed them , said in a low tone , in french , `` comte de la fere , are you there ? '' <EOS>	68.53196137644069
<SOS> `` yes , your majesty , '' he answered , trembling . <EOS>	90.14436016277098
<SOS> `` faithful friend , noble heart ! '' <EOS>	74.00269509955095
<SOS> said the king , `` i should not have been rescued . <EOS>	88.2584325077087
<SOS> i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god ; last of all i speak to you . <EOS>	50.563019566871056

<SOS> you only know that this money exists . <EOS>	54.76149377421791
<SOS> make use of it , then , whenever you think it will be most useful , for my eldest son 's welfare . <EOS>	73.12768711357698
<SOS> and now , farewell . '' <EOS>	65.02706615336336
<SOS> `` farewell , saintly , martyred majesty , '' lisped athos , chilled with terror . <EOS>	71.66542637877431
<SOS> a moment 's silence ensued and then , in a full , sonorous voice , the king exclaimed : `` remember ! '' <EOS>	67.71339698928277
<SOS> he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow . <EOS>	48.742774268380785
<SOS> he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract . <EOS>	50.35440383126883
<SOS> athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned . <EOS>	74.2480110260046
<SOS> at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king . <EOS>	61.536284534989626
<SOS> then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down , crept from behind the drapery , glided between two horses , mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn . <EOS>	72.18685318766316
<SOS> having gained his room he raised his hand to his face , and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch 's blood , fell down insensible . <EOS>	88.47208561209219

<SOS> the man in the mask . <EOS>	79.53294251610974
<SOS> the snow was falling thick and icy . <EOS>	94.05301587164921
<SOS> aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible . <EOS>	83.72977309147954
<SOS> but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk . <EOS>	57.79877077784572
<SOS> `` well , '' said aramis , `` beaten by fate ! '' <EOS>	63.97050117539533
<SOS> `` beaten ! '' <EOS>	79.23790963459426
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	81.50856390042262
<SOS> `` noble and unhappy king ! '' <EOS>	119.20889877395355
<SOS> `` are you wounded ? '' <EOS>	81.9021627015979
<SOS> cried aramis . <EOS>	91.43307778307062
<SOS> `` no , this is his blood . '' <EOS>	67.12787105958759
<SOS> `` where were you , then ? '' <EOS>	50.64910762122185
<SOS> `` where you left me under the scaffold . '' <EOS>	58.47304147934557
<SOS> `` did you see it all ? '' <EOS>	82.99046158011535
<SOS> `` no , but i heard all . <EOS>	70.29299008813655
<SOS> god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed . '' <EOS>	86.52710230546454
<SOS> `` then you know that i did not leave him ? '' <EOS>	99.47663839898522
<SOS> `` i heard your voice up to the last moment . '' <EOS>	65.15444721746941
<SOS> `` here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand ; he desired they should be returned to the queen . '' <EOS>	72.1788690819129
<SOS> `` then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in , '' replied athos , drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king 's blood . <EOS>	80.39587709911281
<SOS> `` and what , '' he continued , `` has been done with the poor body ? '' <EOS>	84.6753891793063
<SOS> `` by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it . <EOS>	105.42966717519634
<SOS> the doctors are embalming the corpse , and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel . '' <EOS>	92.1125173220561
<SOS> `` mockery , '' muttered athos , savagely ; `` royal honors to one whom they have murdered ! '' <EOS>	89.25835713102549
<SOS> `` well , cheer up ! '' <EOS>	59.346667265919784
<SOS> said a loud voice from the staircase , which porthos had just mounted . <EOS>	72.21506971349578
<SOS> `` we are all mortal , my poor friends . '' <EOS>	73.69651325394162
<SOS> `` you are late , my dear porthos . '' <EOS>	69.56784238195307
<SOS> `` yes , there were some people on the way who delayed me . <EOS>	49.09395230127548
<SOS> the wretches were dancing . <EOS>	44.86750362420237
<SOS> i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him . <EOS>	62.290050665320805
<SOS> just then a patrol rode up . <EOS>	90.08752658590863
<SOS> luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak , so i took advantage of his silence to walk off . '' <EOS>	68.1050894057848
<SOS> `` have you seen d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	77.8914358897809
<SOS> `` we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again . '' <EOS>	57.84023384632088
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	107.45067434068453
<SOS> said athos , satirically , `` i saw him . <EOS>	101.01098124408342
<SOS> he was in the front row of the crowd , admirably placed for seeing ; and as on the whole the sight was curious , he probably wished to stay to the end . '' <EOS>	92.16086156369062
<SOS> `` ah comte de la fere , '' said a calm voice , though hoarse with running , `` is it your habit to calumniate the absent ? '' <EOS>	69.02032942818339
<SOS> this reproof stung athos to the heart , but as the impression produced by seeing d'artagnan foremost in a coarse , ferocious crowd had been very strong , he contented himself with replying : `` i am not calumniating you , my friend . <EOS>	78.97403960126165
<SOS> they were anxious about you here ; i simply told them where you were . <EOS>	52.49448851648869
<SOS> you did n't know king charles ; to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him . '' <EOS>	78.50764609930357
<SOS> so saying , he stretched out his hand , but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side . <EOS>	69.70359940985486
<SOS> `` ugh ! <EOS>	63.35303409447287
<SOS> i am tired , '' cried d'artagnan , sitting down . <EOS>	94.19507325778528
<SOS> `` drink a glass of port , '' said aramis ; `` it will refresh you . '' <EOS>	77.83427531793255
<SOS> `` yes , let us drink , '' said athos , anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with d'artagnan , `` let us drink and get away from this hateful country . <EOS>	107.85893594583962
<SOS> the felucca is waiting for us , you know ; let us leave to night , we have nothing more to do here . '' <EOS>	52.87123318603161
<SOS> `` you are in a hurry , sir count , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	57.730573285862754
<SOS> `` but what would you have us to do here , now that the king is dead ? '' <EOS>	73.71925670362955
<SOS> `` go , sir count , '' replied d'artagnan , carelessly ; `` you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england ? <EOS>	54.49333576471892
<SOS> well , for my part , i , a bloodthirsty ruffian , who can go and stand close to a scaffold , in order to have a better view of the king 's execution i remain . '' <EOS>	89.54577391642697
<SOS> athos turned pale . <EOS>	71.75567155219576
<SOS> every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart . <EOS>	95.87747147153607
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	88.26505293037302

<SOS> `` thanks , my worthy friend . <EOS>	93.6799774073573

<SOS> i want to find out who was the man in the mask , who so obligingly offered to cut the king 's throat . '' <EOS>	64.09195626517842
<SOS> `` a man in a mask ? '' <EOS>	75.83175002890759

<SOS> `` you did not let the executioner escape , then ? '' <EOS>	55.09282869880371
<SOS> `` the executioner is still in the cellar , where , i presume , he has had an interview with mine host 's bottles . <EOS>	43.79428299624425

<SOS> mousqueton ! '' <EOS>	50.958412304668755

<SOS> `` an amateur headsman , '' replied aramis , `` who however , does not handle the axe amiss . '' <EOS>	61.99403903762339
<SOS> `` did you not see his face ? '' <EOS>	40.520813251915335
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	55.6032814762945
<SOS> `` he wore a mask . '' <EOS>	69.89858386647647
<SOS> `` but you , aramis , who were close to him ? '' <EOS>	52.61207700751975
<SOS> `` i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask . '' <EOS>	117.4297259163642
<SOS> `` then it must be a man of a certain age . '' <EOS>	109.6103517051407
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	56.57511678104445
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` that matters little . <EOS>	52.69071924822173
<SOS> when one puts on a mask , it is not difficult to wear a beard under it . '' <EOS>	88.15211116501884
<SOS> `` i am sorry i did not follow him , '' said porthos . <EOS>	63.615547462772334
<SOS> `` well , my dear porthos , '' said d'artagnan , `` that 's the very thing it came into my head to do . '' <EOS>	45.19694286450143
<SOS> athos understood all now . <EOS>	82.19701362695734
<SOS> `` pardon me , d'artagnan , '' he said . <EOS>	60.557272093915486
<SOS> `` i have distrusted god ; i could the more easily distrust you . <EOS>	62.877757976239
<SOS> pardon me , my friend . '' <EOS>	86.66771490358134
<SOS> `` we will see about that presently , '' said d'artagnan , with a slight smile . <EOS>	114.83772748246777
<SOS> `` well , then ? '' <EOS>	116.58074540964782
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	73.74093501329747
<SOS> `` well , while i was watching not the king , as monsieur le comte thinks , for i know what it is to see a man led to death , and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner , the idea came to me , as i said , to find out who he was . <EOS>	88.45414644018473
<SOS> now , as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance , as one calls his other hand to aid the first , i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there ; for i had seen you , aramis , with the king , and you , count , i knew would be under the scaffold , and for that reason i forgive you , '' he added , offering athos his hand , `` for you must have suffered much . <EOS>	63.58107231968265
<SOS> i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken , but which , for better or worse , had been patched with plaster and with black silk . <EOS>	85.62149384041562
<SOS> 'humph ! ' <EOS>	48.50274994215885
<SOS> thought i , 'that looks like my handiwork ; i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other . ' <EOS>	71.58794581220813
<SOS> and , in fact , it was that unfortunate scotchman , parry 's brother , you know , on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength . <EOS>	48.72326161925382
<SOS> well , this man was making signs to another at my left , and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud . <EOS>	52.90405855342962
<SOS> 'oh ! ' <EOS>	68.20724728728825
<SOS> said i to him . <EOS>	80.14186481242642
<SOS> grimaud turned round with a jerk , recognized me , and pointed to the man in the mask . <EOS>	67.61015627002254
<SOS> 'eh ! ' <EOS>	76.45167012415081
<SOS> said he , which meant , 'do you see him ? ' <EOS>	99.42363909521845
<SOS> 'parbleu ! ' <EOS>	84.30793850823093
<SOS> i answered , and we perfectly understood one another . <EOS>	97.34177921115192
<SOS> well , everything was finished as you know . <EOS>	50.985595502810675
<SOS> the mob dispersed . <EOS>	98.12814613541927
<SOS> i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman , and we all three retired into a corner of the square . <EOS>	57.832264432090405
<SOS> i saw the executioner return into the king 's room , change his clothes , put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear . <EOS>	73.24918005128464
<SOS> five minutes later he came down the grand staircase . '' <EOS>	116.44542595795824
<SOS> `` you followed him ? '' <EOS>	48.637885124119116
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	76.83383604787937
<SOS> `` i should think so , but not without difficulty . <EOS>	55.7346326507442
<SOS> every few minutes he turned around , and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves . <EOS>	82.22351029296853
<SOS> i might have gone up to him and killed him . <EOS>	57.03106954175508
<SOS> but i am not selfish , and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter . <EOS>	78.0298434200875
<SOS> so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city , and in half an hour 's time he stopped before a little isolated house . <EOS>	106.42298819993171
<SOS> grimaud drew out a pistol . <EOS>	87.8658995018022
<SOS> 'eh ? ' <EOS>	93.11858793363902
<SOS> said he , showing it . <EOS>	71.60240746202557
<SOS> i held back his arm . <EOS>	79.70534028264504
<SOS> the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key ; but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed . <EOS>	69.52634054444488
<SOS> grimaud and i got behind a tree , and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself , threw himself on his face in the road . <EOS>	52.940534536862145
<SOS> next moment the door opened and the man disappeared . '' <EOS>	65.44729524764479
<SOS> `` the scoundrel ! '' <EOS>	92.42972623137298
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	59.446332772716794

<SOS> `` are you still bent on departure , athos ? '' <EOS>	68.72796576738837
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	48.56916963673782
<SOS> `` no , i remain , '' replied athos , with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed . <EOS>	112.5064689917424
<SOS> `` swords , then ! '' <EOS>	56.88838670942542
<SOS> cried aramis , `` swords ! <EOS>	74.71212569146421
<SOS> let us not lose a moment . '' <EOS>	53.230841455479066
<SOS> the four friends resumed their own clothes , girded on their swords , ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure , and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game . <EOS>	65.08788554463598
<SOS> the night was dark , snow was falling , the streets were silent and deserted . <EOS>	84.15283108620463
<SOS> d'artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question . <EOS>	69.26134879764406
<SOS> for a moment d'artagnan thought that parry 's brother had disappeared ; but he was mistaken . <EOS>	57.87474292467936
<SOS> the robust scotchman , accustomed to the snows of his native hills , had stretched himself against a post , and like a fallen statue , insensible to the inclemency of the weather , had allowed the snow to cover him . <EOS>	82.39965935520846
<SOS> he rose , however , as they approached . <EOS>	66.32099398019483
<SOS> `` come , '' said athos , `` here 's another good servant . <EOS>	72.07766786548147

<SOS> `` do n't be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman . <EOS>	60.32309227868495
<SOS> i believe the fellow is here on his own account , for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive . <EOS>	108.22125058285825
<SOS> i should not like to be groslow , if he meets him . '' <EOS>	120.03748945399694
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	70.1135301542115
<SOS> said athos , to the man , in english . <EOS>	109.43156351989143
<SOS> `` no one has come out , '' he replied . <EOS>	71.31911009473258
<SOS> `` then , porthos and aramis , will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud ? '' <EOS>	42.6482972896373
<SOS> grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow , and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle . <EOS>	51.48901400272599
<SOS> `` soho ! '' <EOS>	68.25291090088213
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	63.04196870204062
<SOS> `` yes , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	85.55147297467337
<SOS> `` well , has anybody come out ? '' <EOS>	61.144914221901004
<SOS> `` no , but somebody has gone in . '' <EOS>	69.27438823681914
<SOS> `` a man or a woman ? '' <EOS>	62.224883669012044
<SOS> `` a man . '' <EOS>	47.68133653337237
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	75.80141781986325
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	62.80026251004005
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` there are two of them , then ! '' <EOS>	43.00653815893484
<SOS> `` i wish there were four , '' said athos ; `` the two parties would then be equal . '' <EOS>	95.8530058724215
<SOS> `` perhaps there are four , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	86.48479786512729
<SOS> `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	77.95137816854408
<SOS> `` other men may have entered before them and waited for them . '' <EOS>	98.96297890679475
<SOS> `` we can find out , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	80.47512582026691
<SOS> at the same time he pointed to a window , through the shutters of which a faint light streamed . <EOS>	84.542249539846
<SOS> `` that is true , '' said d'artagnan , `` let us call the others . '' <EOS>	100.08347626787858
<SOS> they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis . <EOS>	76.04513070127071
<SOS> `` have you seen anything ? '' <EOS>	60.78422839958756
<SOS> they asked . <EOS>	60.28913829575293
<SOS> `` no , but we are going to , '' replied d'artagnan , pointing to grimaud , who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground . <EOS>	75.24268936135962
<SOS> all four came up together . <EOS>	46.79284384780477
<SOS> grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook , which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened . <EOS>	70.56321277492879
<SOS> then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right . <EOS>	62.111860068229156
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	60.28573377665278
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	77.59785392391939
<SOS> grimaud showed his closed hand , with two fingers spread out . <EOS>	91.3962175742099
<SOS> `` speak , '' said athos ; `` we can not see your signs . <EOS>	67.19430149953966

<SOS> `` good . <EOS>	94.68471519576248

<SOS> `` do you know him ? '' <EOS>	46.01502124509027
<SOS> `` i thought i recognized him , and was not mistaken . <EOS>	53.01868905472371
<SOS> short and stout . '' <EOS>	44.59906294733813
<SOS> `` who is it ? '' <EOS>	84.49944866556847
<SOS> they all asked together in a low tone . <EOS>	103.62597387789178
<SOS> `` general oliver cromwell . '' <EOS>	70.2221882306826
<SOS> the four friends looked at one another . <EOS>	97.99059983997164
<SOS> `` and the other ? '' <EOS>	71.84861692521116
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	86.86639735113094
<SOS> `` thin and lanky . '' <EOS>	94.60073374350414
<SOS> `` the executioner , '' said d'artagnan and aramis at the same time . <EOS>	43.0489556412339
<SOS> `` i can see nothing but his back , '' resumed grimaud . <EOS>	59.48327837722252
<SOS> `` but wait . <EOS>	79.82063837958984
<SOS> he is moving ; and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see . <EOS>	120.17300097544197
<SOS> ah `` and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan . <EOS>	67.74478182009872
<SOS> `` did you see him ? '' <EOS>	89.95966160544098
<SOS> they all asked . <EOS>	50.903495767225486
<SOS> `` yes , '' said grimaud , with his hair standing on end . <EOS>	63.58278455646697
<SOS> `` the thin , spare man ? '' <EOS>	53.22486649762497
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	58.116677438736886
<SOS> `` the executioner , in short ? '' <EOS>	77.43483310626891
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	120.69581540694587
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	54.816092473368634
<SOS> `` and who is it ? '' <EOS>	93.94630433158636
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	49.70208599337791
<SOS> `` he he is `` murmured grimaud , pale as a ghost and seizing his master 's hand . <EOS>	95.2921447275997
<SOS> `` who ? <EOS>	61.17238676692294
<SOS> he ? '' <EOS>	71.42198561123726
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	74.25427282418103
<SOS> `` mordaunt , '' replied grimaud . <EOS>	60.33439278405834
<SOS> d'artagnan , porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy . <EOS>	72.79544301525605
<SOS> athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow . <EOS>	75.6079321282775
<SOS> `` fatality ! '' <EOS>	95.26954496999902
<SOS> he muttered . <EOS>	83.19656525319954
<SOS> chapter lxviii . <EOS>	70.55247823466205
<SOS> cromwell 's house . <EOS>	73.19818708001272
<SOS> it was , in fact , mordaunt whom d'artagnan had followed , without knowing it . <EOS>	79.01884323612732
<SOS> on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard , then , mounting a staircase , had opened a door , and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk . <EOS>	84.32282197607778
<SOS> this man was cromwell . <EOS>	56.241478452820814
<SOS> cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london , unknown except to the most intimate of his friends . <EOS>	74.27895619444153
<SOS> mordaunt was among these . <EOS>	77.90811716903572
<SOS> `` it is you , mordaunt , '' he said . <EOS>	73.09703724770169
<SOS> `` you are late . '' <EOS>	54.7812498557746
<SOS> `` general , i wished to see the ceremony to the end , which delayed me . '' <EOS>	77.74703189372688
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	109.09474951281166
<SOS> i scarcely thought you were so curious as that . '' <EOS>	83.660363575867
<SOS> `` i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor 's enemies , and he was not among the least of them . <EOS>	87.89324128869025
<SOS> but you , general , were you not at whitehall ? '' <EOS>	69.6710322538376
<SOS> `` no , '' said cromwell . <EOS>	44.452227663669355
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence . <EOS>	47.01939730036492
<SOS> `` have you had any account of it ? '' <EOS>	97.98303093366319
<SOS> `` none . <EOS>	72.63377485824942
<SOS> i have been here since the morning . <EOS>	76.46345184174811
<SOS> i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king . '' <EOS>	75.4299735092229
<SOS> `` ah , you knew that ? '' <EOS>	88.83704920422706
<SOS> said mordaunt . <EOS>	60.6814960527009
<SOS> `` it matters little . <EOS>	54.33861081588851
<SOS> four men , disguised as workmen , were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich , where a vessel was waiting . '' <EOS>	58.170704566866405
<SOS> `` and knowing all that , your honor remained here , far from the city , tranquil and inactive . '' <EOS>	81.6701196022032
<SOS> `` tranquil , yes , '' replied cromwell . <EOS>	93.39847470290627
<SOS> `` but who told you i was inactive ? '' <EOS>	71.07622014008302
<SOS> `` but if the plot had succeeded ? '' <EOS>	75.97541048704424
<SOS> `` i wished it to do so . '' <EOS>	86.92329501443292
<SOS> `` i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i. as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england . '' <EOS>	89.70224471270784
<SOS> `` yes , his death ; but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold . '' <EOS>	98.75932633131686
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	84.90872227314088
<SOS> asked mordaunt . <EOS>	62.89495623826878
<SOS> cromwell smiled . <EOS>	111.02748610315028
<SOS> `` because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity . '' <EOS>	86.63639433831014
<SOS> `` but if he had escaped ? '' <EOS>	76.10008846231403
<SOS> `` impossible ; my precautions were taken . '' <EOS>	64.04309296118636
<SOS> `` and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him ? '' <EOS>	69.95352220454633
<SOS> `` the four frenchmen , of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me . '' <EOS>	53.11963936677758
<SOS> `` and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done ? '' <EOS>	54.69036961592888
<SOS> `` it is possible . <EOS>	118.13531228368649
<SOS> but he will not avow it . '' <EOS>	80.861830796001
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	77.63926553065605
<SOS> `` because they failed . '' <EOS>	106.9276468584388
<SOS> `` your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i . <EOS>	49.27946224492019
<SOS> now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them ? '' <EOS>	95.66435416261325
<SOS> `` take them , '' said cromwell . <EOS>	52.86790122755056
<SOS> mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity . <EOS>	89.1838507535521
<SOS> `` did the people shout at all ? '' <EOS>	88.83900251304493
<SOS> cromwell asked . <EOS>	87.6763465205796
<SOS> `` very little , except 'long live cromwell ! ' '' <EOS>	67.81412577103302
<SOS> `` where were you placed ? '' <EOS>	43.672143396836375
<SOS> mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general 's face if this was simply a useless question , or whether he knew everything . <EOS>	96.01992175595265
<SOS> but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell 's . <EOS>	65.01446854378248
<SOS> `` i was so situated as to hear and see everything , '' he answered . <EOS>	55.295549428136425
<SOS> it was now cromwell 's turn to look fixedly at mordaunt , and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable . <EOS>	47.37333655053688
<SOS> `` it appears , '' said cromwell , `` that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well . <EOS>	82.1389429915855
<SOS> the blow , so they tell me at least , was struck with a master 's hand . '' <EOS>	56.37415172212864
<SOS> mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account , and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution , hidden behind some screen or curtain . <EOS>	83.76019214195156
<SOS> `` in fact , '' said mordaunt , with a calm voice and immovable countenance , `` a single blow sufficed . '' <EOS>	74.62785369118812
<SOS> `` perhaps it was some one in that occupation , '' said cromwell . <EOS>	53.57198928897626
<SOS> `` do you think so , sir ? <EOS>	59.94530311944668
<SOS> he did not look like an executioner . '' <EOS>	61.251967087026294
<SOS> `` and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office ? '' <EOS>	65.18337782423393
<SOS> `` but , '' said mordaunt , `` it might have been some personal enemy of the king , who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way . <EOS>	65.29755485586763
<SOS> perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king , and who , learning that the king was about to flee and escape him , threw himself in the way , with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand , not as substitute for the executioner , but as an ambassador of fate . '' <EOS>	66.5980612557691
<SOS> `` possibly . '' <EOS>	82.15382122517089
<SOS> `` and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action ? '' <EOS>	63.44918741215465
<SOS> `` it is not for me to judge . <EOS>	95.1664496961491
<SOS> it rests between his conscience and his god . '' <EOS>	94.38015237494332
<SOS> `` but if your honor knew this man ? '' <EOS>	72.64937019438365
<SOS> `` i neither know nor wish to know him . <EOS>	59.7941330782976
<SOS> provided charles is dead , it is the axe , not the man , we must thank . '' <EOS>	79.93123108236908
<SOS> `` and yet , without the man , the king would have been rescued . '' <EOS>	78.02939448033793
<SOS> cromwell smiled . <EOS>	62.21426490833592
<SOS> `` they would have carried him to greenwich , '' he said , `` and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold . <EOS>	57.454303195694024
<SOS> once out to sea , you are too good a politician not to understand the rest , mordaunt . '' <EOS>	71.89548809534516
<SOS> `` yes , they would have all been blown up . '' <EOS>	98.11894920531758
<SOS> `` just so . <EOS>	89.59917663738302
<SOS> the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do . <EOS>	76.80522824242998
<SOS> men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god 's . <EOS>	50.00116319661688
<SOS> you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask ; for really , in spite of his excellent intentions , i could not thank him for what he has done . '' <EOS>	83.4590977262149
<SOS> mordaunt bowed humbly . <EOS>	96.61179280823944
<SOS> `` sir , '' he said , `` you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime . '' <EOS>	71.19109568316232
<SOS> `` say absurd , since it has become useless . <EOS>	111.70995083806656
<SOS> the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit . <EOS>	66.37045486776837
<SOS> so to night , mordaunt , go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning . <EOS>	86.83653342698703
<SOS> show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal , unless , indeed `` `` unless ? '' <EOS>	75.51669486711687
<SOS> said mordaunt , whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke : `` this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects . '' <EOS>	51.05619951686937
<SOS> `` oh , my lord , my lord ! '' <EOS>	61.48225359575014
<SOS> `` that title , '' said cromwell , laughing , `` is all very well here , but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public . '' <EOS>	84.17802621292881
<SOS> `` but your honor will soon be called so generally . '' <EOS>	52.714705189621355
<SOS> `` i hope so , at least , '' said cromwell , rising and putting on his cloak . <EOS>	60.177804542499494
<SOS> `` you are going , sir ? '' <EOS>	59.66467077575721
<SOS> `` yes , '' said cromwell . <EOS>	55.46281573622546
<SOS> `` i slept here last night and the night before , and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed . '' <EOS>	68.84273869393623
<SOS> `` then , '' said mordaunt , `` your honor gives me my liberty for to night ? '' <EOS>	66.5067706379615
<SOS> `` and even for all day to morrow , if you want it . <EOS>	41.368487988374966
<SOS> since last evening , '' he added , smiling , `` you have done enough in my service , and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time . '' <EOS>	61.591341603984695
<SOS> `` thank you , sir ; it will be well employed , i hope . '' <EOS>	73.6601680816403
<SOS> cromwell turned as he was going . <EOS>	94.72347446376125
<SOS> `` are you armed ? '' <EOS>	70.35563619648715
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	97.99579679084977
<SOS> `` i have my sword . '' <EOS>	79.1673456981182
<SOS> `` and no one waiting for you outside ? '' <EOS>	61.95936118833541
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	69.53778597427608
<SOS> `` then you had better come with me . '' <EOS>	79.20036914114864
<SOS> `` thank you , sir , but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose . '' <EOS>	39.86079908540438
<SOS> cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it . <EOS>	105.9324491708495
<SOS> it closed after him with a spring . <EOS>	80.16295963360317
<SOS> this door communicated with a subterranean passage , leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector . <EOS>	75.91124348761993
<SOS> it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together . <EOS>	86.60357324150257
<SOS> d'artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise . <EOS>	68.83106413074317
<SOS> `` mordaunt , '' he cried . <EOS>	57.16709449107642
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	76.65928698473311
<SOS> by heaven ! <EOS>	76.93991857282879
<SOS> it is god himself who sent us here . '' <EOS>	61.336634950125365
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos , `` let us break the door in and fall upon him . '' <EOS>	49.424047943760705
<SOS> `` no , '' replied d'artagnan , `` no noise . <EOS>	85.65815849418006
<SOS> now , grimaud , you come here , climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed . <EOS>	92.01831356370903
<SOS> if he comes out we shall catch him . <EOS>	74.86030911840915
<SOS> if he stays in we will break in the window . <EOS>	60.28950612067638
<SOS> it is easier and less noisy than the door . '' <EOS>	76.59746665920953
<SOS> grimaud began to scale the wall again . <EOS>	75.13528584007639
<SOS> `` keep guard at the other door , athos and aramis . <EOS>	61.37020312963232

<SOS> the friends obeyed . <EOS>	63.672477441245114
<SOS> `` he is alone , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	52.915778014107445
<SOS> `` we did not see his companion come out . '' <EOS>	55.78967013649042
<SOS> `` he may have gone by the other door . '' <EOS>	50.55563126127278

<SOS> `` putting on his cloak and gloves . '' <EOS>	42.91273492950927
<SOS> `` he 's ours , '' muttered d'artagnan . <EOS>	95.39642539507912
<SOS> porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard . <EOS>	79.66387420464645
<SOS> `` put it up again , my friend , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	103.28395225230723
<SOS> `` we must proceed in an orderly manner . '' <EOS>	83.21778650324175
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	73.11096827836163
<SOS> said grimaud , `` he is coming out . <EOS>	76.77081464258976

<SOS> `` get down then and quickly . '' <EOS>	55.50135986436209
<SOS> grimaud leaped down . <EOS>	95.79296867678663
<SOS> the snow deadened the noise of his fall . <EOS>	69.04919104459887
<SOS> `` now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him . <EOS>	56.59524833111008
<SOS> we will do the same . '' <EOS>	61.25458879853698
<SOS> the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold , face to face with d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.64286374093209
<SOS> porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around . <EOS>	83.83347992752351
<SOS> mordaunt was livid , but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance . <EOS>	55.18082953483458
<SOS> d'artagnan quietly pushed him in again , and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one , keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt 's hands , who , however , knowing that it was useless , attempted no resistance . <EOS>	57.964958606133315
<SOS> at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell . <EOS>	94.98881732161836
<SOS> porthos came up behind , and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room . <EOS>	64.83080355356635
<SOS> athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them . <EOS>	53.07643156436563
<SOS> `` oblige me by taking a seat , '' said d'artagnan , pushing a chair toward mordaunt , who sat down , pale but calm . <EOS>	69.61773497280934
<SOS> aramis , porthos and d'artagnan drew their chairs near him . <EOS>	40.26848296255448
<SOS> athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room , as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings . <EOS>	97.26247892859004
<SOS> he seemed to be quite overcome . <EOS>	51.19866601972531
<SOS> porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience . <EOS>	83.20396597515663
<SOS> aramis bit his lips till the blood came . <EOS>	66.83033011799152
<SOS> d'artagnan alone was calm , at least in appearance . <EOS>	72.3173680427391
<SOS> `` monsieur mordaunt , '' he said , `` since , after running after one another so long , chance has at last brought us together , let us have a little conversation , if you please . '' <EOS>	85.29029506094729
<SOS> chapter lxix . <EOS>	64.24304929064071
<SOS> conversational . <EOS>	89.4129301766425
<SOS> though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion , when once seated he recovered himself , as it were , and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape . <EOS>	106.59172780205266
<SOS> his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand . <EOS>	84.27305364023223
<SOS> d'artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing . <EOS>	115.14816189484533
<SOS> aramis muttered to himself , `` we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things . '' <EOS>	74.26777777798998
<SOS> porthos sucked his mustache , muttering , `` a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder . '' <EOS>	86.02532448542057
<SOS> athos shrunk into his corner , pale and motionless as a bas relief . <EOS>	77.97063784968388
<SOS> the silence , however , could not last forever . <EOS>	52.35833318777284
<SOS> so d'artagnan began : `` sir , '' he said , with desperate politeness , `` it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do , whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france . '' <EOS>	73.14501569839322
<SOS> mordaunt did not reply . <EOS>	94.61062514021165
<SOS> `` just now , '' d'artagnan continued , `` you were disguised i mean to say , attired as a murderer , and now `` `` and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered . '' <EOS>	85.46815685087373
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	71.93197592981679
<SOS> sir , '' said d'artagnan , `` how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side ? '' <EOS>	109.06520632417894
<SOS> `` no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers . '' <EOS>	90.44963840305554
<SOS> `` well , that is scarcely the question . <EOS>	83.53977584368269
<SOS> i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume . <EOS>	80.64940748583496
<SOS> the mask and beard became you very well , and as to the axe , i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment . <EOS>	72.00537344562751
<SOS> why , then , have you laid it aside ? '' <EOS>	95.9085145284265
<SOS> `` because , remembering the scene at armentieres , i thought i should find four axes for one , as i was to meet four executioners . '' <EOS>	108.55141348673205
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied d'artagnan , in the calmest manner possible , `` you are very young ; i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks . <EOS>	96.55175417411048
<SOS> what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion . <EOS>	76.20320867179153
<SOS> we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us . '' <EOS>	112.99048410528427
<SOS> `` aha ! <EOS>	109.24544171537536
<SOS> it is a duel , then ? '' <EOS>	55.68339187477691
<SOS> cried mordaunt , as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation . <EOS>	38.7847739985682
<SOS> porthos rose , always ready for this kind of adventure . <EOS>	79.7901796189444
<SOS> `` pardon me , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	53.68317898246006
<SOS> `` do not let us do things in a hurry . <EOS>	80.23299472517623
<SOS> we will arrange the matter rather better . <EOS>	56.44502007293922
<SOS> confess , monsieur mordaunt , that you are anxious to kill some of us . '' <EOS>	59.225881523440094
<SOS> `` all , '' replied mordaunt . <EOS>	105.82556411878379
<SOS> `` then , my dear sir ; i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also . <EOS>	96.98710877066114
<SOS> of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen , and the best proof i can furnish is this `` so saying , he threw his hat on the ground , pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace . <EOS>	84.1507820465946
<SOS> `` at your service , sir , '' he continued . <EOS>	105.32267217272032
<SOS> `` my sword is shorter than yours , it 's true , but , bah ! <EOS>	40.583113341483894
<SOS> i think the arm will make up for the sword . '' <EOS>	56.1256714995105
<SOS> `` halt ! '' <EOS>	57.847645109894316
<SOS> cried porthos coming forward . <EOS>	102.76460379504168
<SOS> `` i begin , and without any rhetoric . '' <EOS>	100.96843484236587
<SOS> `` allow me , porthos , '' said aramis . <EOS>	67.55524214464145
<SOS> athos did not move . <EOS>	106.65139997796634
<SOS> he might have been taken for a statue . <EOS>	63.228648411137584
<SOS> even his breathing seemed to be arrested . <EOS>	62.43299621200711
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said d'artagnan , `` you shall have your turn . <EOS>	94.64501606211981
<SOS> monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward . <EOS>	73.84859901806963
<SOS> you can see it in his eye . <EOS>	69.36804559639862
<SOS> so pray keep your places , like athos , whose calmness is entirely laudable . <EOS>	62.08814752839966
<SOS> besides , we will have no words about it . <EOS>	68.42837338971492
<SOS> i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin . '' <EOS>	72.87551332911016
<SOS> porthos and aramis drew back , disappointed , and drawing his sword d'artagnan turned to his adversary : `` sir , i am waiting for you . '' <EOS>	67.38336569589434
<SOS> `` and for my part , gentlemen , i admire you . <EOS>	63.03591138831667
<SOS> you are disputing which shall fight me first , but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter . <EOS>	70.87721313215116
<SOS> i hate you all , but not equally . <EOS>	91.60059570536576
<SOS> i hope to kill all four of you , but i am more likely to kill the first than the second , the second than the third , and the third than the last . <EOS>	53.98405268020382
<SOS> i claim , then , the right to choose my opponent . <EOS>	79.83741883182668
<SOS> if you refuse this right you may kill me , but i shall not fight . '' <EOS>	96.73753287185174
<SOS> `` it is but fair , '' said porthos and aramis , hoping he would choose one of them . <EOS>	64.96670619660397
<SOS> athos and d'artagnan said nothing , but their silence seemed to imply consent . <EOS>	68.13279177452759
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said mordaunt , `` i choose for my adversary the man who , not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere , calls himself athos . '' <EOS>	44.95571319975899
<SOS> athos sprang up , but after an instant of motionless silence he said , to the astonishment of his friends , `` monsieur mordaunt , a duel between us is impossible . <EOS>	68.48270692544261
<SOS> submit this honour to somebody else . '' <EOS>	48.276896799254665
<SOS> and he sat down . <EOS>	81.6257332540222
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	84.95659848870262
<SOS> said mordaunt , with a sneer , `` there 's one who is afraid . '' <EOS>	51.969077137015496
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	54.11133409554104
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , bounding toward him , `` who says that athos is afraid ? '' <EOS>	56.29415925603971
<SOS> `` let him have his say , d'artagnan , '' said athos , with a smile of sadness and contempt . <EOS>	57.21826631970967
<SOS> `` is it your decision , athos ? '' <EOS>	75.44730805505766
<SOS> resumed the gascon . <EOS>	80.4267090488489
<SOS> `` irrevocably . '' <EOS>	83.60053756974443
<SOS> `` you hear , sir , '' said d'artagnan , turning to mordaunt . <EOS>	60.214646939677685
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you . <EOS>	70.10157296942576
<SOS> choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere . '' <EOS>	88.61518132161915
<SOS> `` as long as i do n't fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight . <EOS>	86.15067372112352
<SOS> put your names into a hat and draw lots . '' <EOS>	67.24226580293191
<SOS> `` a good idea , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	54.272261814690864
<SOS> `` at least that will conciliate us all , '' said aramis . <EOS>	47.07508865906431
<SOS> `` i should never have thought of that , '' said porthos , `` and yet it is very simple . '' <EOS>	107.25955696216533
<SOS> `` come , aramis , '' said d'artagnan , `` write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham . '' <EOS>	72.31221570455494
<SOS> mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing . <EOS>	91.09818106963742
<SOS> he stood with his arms folded , apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances . <EOS>	102.04668253834394
<SOS> if he had not courage he had what is very like it , namely , pride . <EOS>	76.68510298502966
<SOS> aramis went to cromwell 's desk , tore off three bits of paper of equal size , wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions , and presented them open to mordaunt , who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis . <EOS>	109.18682363148923
<SOS> he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat , which he handed to mordaunt . <EOS>	68.12060124728609
<SOS> mordaunt put his hand into the hat , took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it . <EOS>	57.262349924643374
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	53.119280111201874
<SOS> serpent , '' muttered d'artagnan , `` i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name . '' <EOS>	96.22803580396616
<SOS> aramis opened the paper , and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read `` d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	81.12495619457718
<SOS> the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt : `` i hope , sir , '' said he , `` you have no objection to make . '' <EOS>	58.522589003567354
<SOS> `` none , whatever , '' replied the other , drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot . <EOS>	68.90975075816498
<SOS> the moment that d'artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him , he recovered his usual tranquillity . <EOS>	100.97276983240293
<SOS> he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor , but did not fail , however , to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner . <EOS>	63.216377375819256
<SOS> `` are you ready , sir ? '' <EOS>	83.44062893560125
<SOS> he said at last . <EOS>	67.21027513726467
<SOS> `` i was waiting for you , sir , '' said mordaunt , raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe . <EOS>	116.79630316381099
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said the gascon , `` take care of yourself , for i am not a bad hand at the rapier . '' <EOS>	42.54899823212759
<SOS> `` nor i either . '' <EOS>	91.15789948428765
<SOS> `` so much the better ; that sets my mind at rest . <EOS>	81.75205683422725
<SOS> defend yourself . '' <EOS>	84.83315259175993
<SOS> `` one minute , '' said the young man . <EOS>	69.1625636726806
<SOS> `` give me your word , gentlemen , that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other . '' <EOS>	100.21334985566475
<SOS> `` is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that , my little viper ? '' <EOS>	83.10043684819892
<SOS> `` no , but to set my mind at rest , as you observed just now . '' <EOS>	80.0910149554222
<SOS> `` it is for something else than that , i imagine , '' muttered d'artagnan , shaking his head doubtfully . <EOS>	68.69399196910055
<SOS> `` on the honor of gentlemen , '' said aramis and porthos . <EOS>	74.96672846733065
<SOS> `` in that case , gentlemen , have the kindness to retire into the corners , so as to give us ample room . <EOS>	63.0571711471595
<SOS> we shall require it . '' <EOS>	67.23249577665248
<SOS> `` yes , gentlemen , '' said d'artagnan , `` we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly , which , with all due respect , i fancy he is anxious still to do . '' <EOS>	75.30132763806198
<SOS> this new attack made no impression on mordaunt . <EOS>	97.60818818612158
<SOS> the space was cleared , the two lamps placed on cromwell 's desk , in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible ; and the swords crossed . <EOS>	64.59875932846812
<SOS> d'artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent . <EOS>	55.99245484558791
<SOS> he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried . <EOS>	87.73696077728685
<SOS> `` aha ! '' <EOS>	98.97383550297421
<SOS> he cried with a smile of satisfaction . <EOS>	56.83363842188619
<SOS> and without losing a minute , thinking he saw an opening , he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring . <EOS>	51.09185143166959
<SOS> this time it was mordaunt who smiled . <EOS>	74.96595943313677
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' said d'artagnan , `` you have a wicked smile . <EOS>	61.86288911640258
<SOS> it must have been the devil who taught it you , was it not ? '' <EOS>	70.56087538996276
<SOS> mordaunt replied by trying his opponent 's weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble ; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved , he succeeded in meeting his sword , which slid along his own without touching his chest . <EOS>	66.2911282726752
<SOS> mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step . <EOS>	80.7512805952742
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	112.24512717251649
<SOS> you lose ground , you are turning ? <EOS>	87.73682128024953
<SOS> well , as you please , i even gain something by it , for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours . <EOS>	68.48762016696031
<SOS> you have no idea what a false look you have , particularly when you are afraid . <EOS>	105.41428318712707
<SOS> look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance . '' <EOS>	85.64630063505237
<SOS> to this flow of words , not perhaps in the best taste , but characteristic of d'artagnan , whose principal object was to divert his opponent 's attention , mordaunt did not reply , but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d'artagnan . <EOS>	71.58820074188861
<SOS> he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious . <EOS>	50.913394083820215
<SOS> `` come , come , '' cried d'artagnan , `` we must finish with this , '' and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard , who continued to lose ground , but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment . <EOS>	105.02750522132884
<SOS> however , as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever , mordaunt 's foot at last touched the wall , against which he rested his left hand . <EOS>	107.8205099112457
<SOS> `` ah , this time you can not lose ground , my fine friend ! '' <EOS>	103.9761733175084
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan . <EOS>	98.42521805507506
<SOS> `` gentlemen , did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall ? <EOS>	68.0426676167064
<SOS> no . <EOS>	97.98236747119651
<SOS> well , then , you shall see it now . '' <EOS>	60.94874322074016
<SOS> in a second d'artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt , all of which touched , but only pricked him . <EOS>	65.01578696543126
<SOS> the three friends looked on , panting and astonished . <EOS>	64.13561103048673
<SOS> at last d'artagnan , having got up too close , stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust , but the moment when , after a fine , quick feint , he was attacking as sharply as lightning , the wall seemed to give way , mordaunt disappeared through the opening , and d'artagnan 's blade , caught between the panels , shivered like a sword of glass . <EOS>	79.33263482387675
<SOS> d'artagnan sprang back ; the wall had closed again . <EOS>	58.004850085389506
<SOS> mordaunt , in fact , while defending himself , had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left , had felt for the knob with his left hand , pressed it and disappeared . <EOS>	50.54736258617959
<SOS> the gascon uttered a furious imprecation , which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel . <EOS>	88.90541173834633
<SOS> `` help me , gentlemen , '' cried d'artagnan , `` we must break in this door . '' <EOS>	73.90317934127609
<SOS> `` it is the devil in person ! '' <EOS>	64.21137283991914
<SOS> said aramis , hastening forward . <EOS>	61.16982593908705
<SOS> `` he escapes us , '' growled porthos , pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges , but in vain . <EOS>	63.46472257098382
<SOS> `` 'sblood ! <EOS>	62.39978497290482
<SOS> he escapes us . '' <EOS>	69.28599846035826
<SOS> `` so much the better , '' muttered athos . <EOS>	113.96400717897576
<SOS> `` i thought as much , '' said d'artagnan , wasting his strength in useless efforts . <EOS>	58.54360475958314
<SOS> `` zounds , i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room . <EOS>	112.47565475077519
<SOS> i thought he was up to something . '' <EOS>	73.08893111721663
<SOS> `` it 's a misfortune , to which his friend , the devil , treats us , '' said aramis . <EOS>	68.23280983914333
<SOS> `` it 's a piece of good fortune sent from heaven , '' said athos , evidently much relieved . <EOS>	102.4787837125233
<SOS> `` really ! '' <EOS>	75.65699040033192
<SOS> said d'artagnan , abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts , `` athos , i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way . <EOS>	91.04513097731716
<SOS> you can not understand the position we are in . <EOS>	81.34704529603641
<SOS> in this kind of game , not to kill is to let one 's self be killed . <EOS>	84.66254560533898
<SOS> this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place . <EOS>	90.2389334778572
<SOS> come , come , we must be off . <EOS>	51.58324403676878
<SOS> if we stay here five minutes more there 's an end of us . '' <EOS>	69.55691572896876
<SOS> `` yes , you are right . '' <EOS>	92.63358186402111
<SOS> `` but where shall we go ? '' <EOS>	87.47959944024018
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	53.13803943027289
<SOS> `` to the hotel , to be sure , to get our baggage and horses ; and from there , if it please god , to france , where , at least , i understand the architecture of the houses . '' <EOS>	72.58222014304141
<SOS> so , suiting the action to the word , d'artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard , picked up his hat and ran down the stairs , followed by the others . <EOS>	82.62913649641477
<SOS> chapter lxx . <EOS>	62.77374549298487
<SOS> the skiff `` lightning . '' <EOS>	73.15337754142658
<SOS> d'artagnan had judged correctly ; mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose , and he lost none . <EOS>	72.5458957688227
<SOS> he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that . <EOS>	94.89943940945307
<SOS> this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them . <EOS>	79.04296136530488
<SOS> after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage , sheathing on the way his now useless sword , and thus reached the neighboring house , where he paused to examine himself and to take breath . <EOS>	81.49469747573876
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	40.812229796572375
<SOS> he said , `` nothing , almost nothing scratches , nothing more ; two in the arm and one in the breast . <EOS>	93.62697089467645
<SOS> the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune , my uncle and king charles . <EOS>	67.64027758315831
<SOS> now , not a second to lose , for a second lost will perhaps save them . <EOS>	62.22304663063992
<SOS> they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god 's . <EOS>	103.98698770162036
<SOS> they must disappear , broken , scattered , annihilated . <EOS>	65.35027233238962
<SOS> i will run , then , till my legs no longer serve , till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do . '' <EOS>	93.85973982244997
<SOS> mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks , about a quarter of a league distant . <EOS>	55.23543010967117
<SOS> he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes . <EOS>	104.3214303553958
<SOS> arrived at the barracks he made himself known , took the best horse in the stables , mounted and gained the high road . <EOS>	77.8991531086072
<SOS> a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich . <EOS>	72.24787346617215
<SOS> `` there is the port , '' he murmured . <EOS>	42.83435318647538
<SOS> `` that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs . <EOS>	105.73458967151623
<SOS> good ! <EOS>	77.66022261922147
<SOS> i am half an hour in advance of them , an hour , perhaps . <EOS>	55.87485848226233
<SOS> fool that i was ! <EOS>	88.7156373599877
<SOS> i have almost killed myself by my needless haste . <EOS>	53.288306335706906
<SOS> now , '' he added , rising in the stirrups and looking about him , `` which , i wonder , is the lightning ? '' <EOS>	59.89104189169452
<SOS> at this moment , as if in reply to his words , a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him . <EOS>	60.66954556096976
<SOS> mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket , and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him . <EOS>	60.14116712029419
<SOS> he was wrapped in a large rough cape , which concealed his form and partly his face . <EOS>	114.87627964999412
<SOS> `` do you wish to go on the water , sir ? '' <EOS>	57.953359662424454
<SOS> said the sailor . <EOS>	69.53779719608607
<SOS> `` yes , just so . <EOS>	101.54788219450859
<SOS> along the isle of dogs . '' <EOS>	64.53850694368398
<SOS> `` and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another . <EOS>	99.68527032413306
<SOS> you would like one that sails as rapidly as `` `` lightning , '' interrupted mordaunt . <EOS>	70.06631541831877
<SOS> `` then mine is the boat you want , sir . <EOS>	65.50731161337413
<SOS> i 'm your man . '' <EOS>	77.7400348795225
<SOS> `` i begin to think so , particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal . '' <EOS>	73.9042377696348
<SOS> `` here it is , sir , '' and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief , tied at each corner . <EOS>	81.28387227569561
<SOS> `` good , quite right ! '' <EOS>	39.674220283712486
<SOS> cried mordaunt , springing off his horse . <EOS>	46.39206992565566
<SOS> `` there 's not a moment to lose ; now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel . '' <EOS>	67.27741599132547
<SOS> `` but , '' asked the sailor , `` where are your companions ? <EOS>	85.73780630382646
<SOS> i thought there were four of you . '' <EOS>	52.834046204869644
<SOS> `` listen to me , sir . <EOS>	86.66871735361659

<SOS> under orders from general cromwell . <EOS>	77.86387284935729

<SOS> `` indeed , sir , i recognize you ; you are captain mordaunt . '' <EOS>	84.25004997800136
<SOS> mordaunt was startled . <EOS>	61.44505637765159
<SOS> `` oh , fear nothing , '' said the skipper , showing his face . <EOS>	58.779555446513136
<SOS> `` i am a friend . '' <EOS>	100.80752974624838
<SOS> `` captain groslow ! '' <EOS>	85.86446894280516
<SOS> cried mordaunt . <EOS>	78.68453523833074
<SOS> `` himself . <EOS>	93.16149615148373
<SOS> the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition . <EOS>	63.02554072310322
<SOS> is there anything new in the wind ? '' <EOS>	107.72760461442101
<SOS> `` nothing . '' <EOS>	45.26401517727324
<SOS> `` i thought , perhaps , that the king 's death `` `` has only hastened their flight ; in ten minutes they will perhaps be here . '' <EOS>	81.18272768019129
<SOS> `` what have you come for , then ? '' <EOS>	110.39488118814862
<SOS> `` to embark with you . '' <EOS>	73.38928065685977
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	65.95680478743556
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	85.43309300606448
<SOS> the general doubted my fidelity ? '' <EOS>	59.769647010942975
<SOS> `` no , but i wish to have a share in my revenge . <EOS>	88.9386784386647
<SOS> have n't you some one who will relieve me of my horse ? '' <EOS>	60.391063319152174
<SOS> groslow whistled and a sailor appeared . <EOS>	72.04854714779543
<SOS> `` patrick , '' said groslow , `` take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn . <EOS>	54.45658741067904
<SOS> if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman . '' <EOS>	62.66008024766166
<SOS> the sailor departed without reply . <EOS>	49.81507698234093
<SOS> `` now , '' said mordaunt , `` are you not afraid that they will recognize you ? '' <EOS>	57.95209821778942
<SOS> `` there is no danger , dressed as i am in this pilot coat , on a night as dark as this . <EOS>	86.40931319990354
<SOS> besides even you did n't recognize me ; they will be much less likely to . '' <EOS>	83.95484575639507
<SOS> `` that is true , '' said mordaunt , `` and they will be far from thinking of you . <EOS>	77.40595540638121
<SOS> everything is ready , is it not ? '' <EOS>	69.09944505313867
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	65.54617222824872
<SOS> `` the cargo on board ? '' <EOS>	43.61674443873008
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	55.3101844304417
<SOS> `` five full casks ? '' <EOS>	68.8115094372412
<SOS> `` and fifty empty ones . '' <EOS>	67.05338862145946
<SOS> `` good . '' <EOS>	110.43754209952114
<SOS> `` we are carrying port wine to anvers . '' <EOS>	68.98283067185322
<SOS> `` excellent . <EOS>	68.12407108270655
<SOS> now take me aboard and return to your post , for they will soon be here . '' <EOS>	94.4046062100595
<SOS> `` i am ready . '' <EOS>	65.21989143715938
<SOS> `` it is important that none of your crew should see me . '' <EOS>	69.33946092073136
<SOS> `` i have but one man on board , and i am as sure of him as i am of myself . <EOS>	48.81236976316698
<SOS> besides , he does n't know you ; like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan . '' <EOS>	57.80525369363802
<SOS> `` very well ; let us go . '' <EOS>	90.2382039747844
<SOS> they then went down to the thames . <EOS>	53.1435291854029
<SOS> a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake . <EOS>	73.55064621699925
<SOS> groslow jumped in , followed by mordaunt , and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of london ; and mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the isle of dogs . <EOS>	87.55386151485749
<SOS> when they reached the side of this felucca , mordaunt , dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance , seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen . <EOS>	59.611981882276474
<SOS> he went with groslow to the captain 's berth , a sort of temporary cabin of planks , for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers , who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat . <EOS>	82.22524809209598
<SOS> `` they will have nothing to do , then at this end ? '' <EOS>	80.35678261894638
<SOS> said mordaunt . <EOS>	55.55020590046005
<SOS> `` nothing at all . '' <EOS>	84.26659729082225
<SOS> `` that 's a capital arrangement . <EOS>	88.07457295059288
<SOS> return to greenwich and bring them here . <EOS>	63.01794199711114
<SOS> i shall hide myself in your cabin . <EOS>	88.94208865579238
<SOS> you have a longboat ? '' <EOS>	79.41573223052956
<SOS> `` that in which we came . '' <EOS>	77.84124396774581
<SOS> `` it appeared light and well constructed . '' <EOS>	66.61954759310308
<SOS> `` quite a canoe . '' <EOS>	79.06557432647192
<SOS> `` fasten it to the poop with a rope ; put the oars into it , so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord . <EOS>	122.21883695968934
<SOS> put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen ; should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with . '' <EOS>	47.761072323185
<SOS> `` consider all this done . <EOS>	112.55680860388804
<SOS> do you wish to see the powder room ? '' <EOS>	58.957175049895795
<SOS> `` no . <EOS>	76.30670536819851
<SOS> when you return i will set the fuse myself , but be careful to conceal your face , so that you can not be recognized by them . '' <EOS>	67.20688273306885
<SOS> `` never fear . '' <EOS>	53.798023528052475
<SOS> `` there 's ten o'clock striking at greenwich . '' <EOS>	51.45887136850753
<SOS> groslow , then , having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance , went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich . <EOS>	71.73603587934463
<SOS> the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted , as he approached it ; but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road . <EOS>	69.11858473320467
<SOS> these horsemen were our friends , or rather , an avant garde , composed of d'artagnan and athos . <EOS>	113.88496851328809
<SOS> as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped , as if guessing that he was the man they wanted . <EOS>	65.06786012503652
<SOS> athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner , whilst d'artagnan , ever cautious , remained on horseback , one hand upon his pistol , leaning forward watchfully . <EOS>	65.50532607323063
<SOS> on seeing the appointed signal , groslow , who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot , walked straight up to the gentlemen . <EOS>	64.033978777404
<SOS> he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous ; nevertheless , the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them . <EOS>	85.86844858353248
<SOS> `` what do you want with us ? '' <EOS>	60.49957634876099
<SOS> he asked of groslow . <EOS>	81.3897968991382
<SOS> `` i wish to inform you , my lord , '' replied groslow , with an irish accent , feigned of course , `` that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him . <EOS>	51.003296786185054
<SOS> he fell down this morning and broke his leg . <EOS>	52.13145781468117
<SOS> but i 'm his cousin ; he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him , and in his place to conduct , wherever they wished to go , the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner , like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket . '' <EOS>	103.04843036663314
<SOS> and he drew out the handkerchief . <EOS>	61.592080787091305
<SOS> `` was that all he said ? '' <EOS>	77.15129101933117
<SOS> inquired athos . <EOS>	60.017428945431085
<SOS> `` no , my lord ; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france . '' <EOS>	72.84188611623317
<SOS> `` what do you think of all this ? '' <EOS>	55.247820408402234
<SOS> said athos , in a low tone to d'artagnan , after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english . <EOS>	50.4976670756589
<SOS> `` it seems a likely story to me . '' <EOS>	76.47513406323768
<SOS> `` and to me , too . '' <EOS>	85.56092399923098
<SOS> `` besides , we can but blow out his brains if he proves false , '' said the gascon ; `` and you , athos , you know something of everything and can be our captain . <EOS>	98.71061765230816
<SOS> i dare say you know how to navigate , should he fail us . '' <EOS>	69.6163368658059
<SOS> `` my dear friend , you guess well . <EOS>	63.54806002281797
<SOS> my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation . '' <EOS>	58.59760039599698
<SOS> `` you see ! '' <EOS>	118.11290809604145
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	43.89188165911898
<SOS> they then summoned their friends , who , with blaisois , mousqueton and grimaud , promptly joined them , leaving parry behind them , who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys , which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him . <EOS>	97.11543138363291
<SOS> thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which , if not large , was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents . <EOS>	54.642847195390715
<SOS> parry parted from his friends regretfully ; they had proposed his going with them to france , but he had straightway declined . <EOS>	87.03024748501593
<SOS> `` it is very simple , '' mousqueton had said ; `` he is thinking of groslow . '' <EOS>	72.05588183190558
<SOS> it was captain groslow , the reader will remember , who had broken parry 's head . <EOS>	92.21900981415207
<SOS> d'artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him . <EOS>	46.61593843326227
<SOS> he found the wharf too completely deserted , the night too dark , the captain too accommodating . <EOS>	66.46993799562208
<SOS> he had reported to aramis what had taken place , and aramis , not less distrustful than he , had increased his suspicions . <EOS>	80.98891937164258
<SOS> a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon 's uneasiness . <EOS>	106.61599740072332
<SOS> `` we have no time now for suspicions , '' said athos . <EOS>	83.37437737048943
<SOS> `` the boat is waiting for us ; come . '' <EOS>	121.0460532327838
<SOS> `` besides , '' said aramis , `` what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time ? <EOS>	52.439422649050535
<SOS> we can watch the skipper . '' <EOS>	82.69354224653178
<SOS> `` and if he does n't go straight i will crush him , that 's all . '' <EOS>	104.63554171321613
<SOS> `` well said , porthos , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	80.25538086525626
<SOS> `` let us go , then . <EOS>	55.78451033654277
<SOS> you first , mousqueton , '' and he stopped his friends , directing the valets to go first , in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat . <EOS>	85.06987138901113
<SOS> the three valets passed without accident . <EOS>	50.11041369916937
<SOS> athos followed them , then porthos , then aramis . <EOS>	55.558163482782426
<SOS> d'artagnan went last , still shaking his head . <EOS>	86.42439343838703
<SOS> `` what in the devil is the matter with you , my friend ? '' <EOS>	63.805212318372995
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	68.92761540328969
<SOS> `` upon my word you would make caesar afraid . '' <EOS>	56.94323779774264
<SOS> `` the matter is , '' replied d'artagnan , `` that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman . '' <EOS>	77.07158142041247
<SOS> `` and you complain of that ! '' <EOS>	58.743152990513764

<SOS> but no matter ; we must trust in god . '' <EOS>	78.72161741568578
<SOS> as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors , who , boat hook in hand , began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved . <EOS>	103.095065780719
<SOS> the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row . <EOS>	84.44120198214011
<SOS> as soon as there was room for rowing , his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly . <EOS>	86.45719881079813
<SOS> `` at last we are off ! '' <EOS>	68.71694389333331
<SOS> exclaimed porthos . <EOS>	56.329191231091265
<SOS> `` alas , '' said athos , `` we depart alone . '' <EOS>	87.1700246975097

<SOS> `` ah , my friend ! '' <EOS>	50.74382485985073
<SOS> cried porthos , `` like the crows , you always bring bad omens . <EOS>	50.087716660635714

<SOS> yes , athos , you may laugh , but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us . '' <EOS>	51.052841783082094
<SOS> `` but , '' said porthos , with great wisdom , `` that was impossible , for they would have killed the captain and the sailors . '' <EOS>	112.68081641552638
<SOS> `` bah ! <EOS>	84.23524408868379

<SOS> `` the lightning , '' answered the captain , `` our felucca . '' <EOS>	100.58317859056349
<SOS> `` so far , so good , '' laughed athos . <EOS>	42.73114643409308
<SOS> they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party ; he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one . <EOS>	105.05349918403026
<SOS> `` stop a moment , '' cried d'artagnan ; `` pray how many men have you on board , captain ? '' <EOS>	115.17029210079123

<SOS> `` explain it , athos . '' <EOS>	59.22463367051085
<SOS> groslow , on the question being interpreted , answered , `` three , without counting myself . '' <EOS>	83.0213066665146
<SOS> d'artagnan understood , for while replying the captain had raised three fingers . <EOS>	63.92474545742017
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	83.54088598477027
<SOS> he exclaimed , `` i begin to be more at my ease , however , whilst you settle yourselves , i shall make the round of the boat . '' <EOS>	64.51824313314219
<SOS> `` as for me , '' said porthos , `` i will see to the supper . '' <EOS>	60.52681053185624
<SOS> `` a very good idea , porthos , '' said the gascon . <EOS>	84.53832000983202
<SOS> `` athos lend me grimaud , who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english , and can act as my interpreter . '' <EOS>	83.82225597796737
<SOS> `` go , grimaud , '' said athos . <EOS>	85.24840881907566
<SOS> d'artagnan , finding a lantern on the deck , took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain , in english , `` come , '' ( being , with the classic english oath , the only english words he knew ) , and so saying he descended to the lower deck . <EOS>	41.279614081890074
<SOS> this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos , porthos and aramis were to pass the night ; the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants , the third , under the prow of the ship , was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed . <EOS>	53.18586522594064
<SOS> `` oho ! '' <EOS>	76.99452279623821
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , as he went down the steps of the hatchway , preceded by the lantern , `` what a number of barrels ! <EOS>	41.642223883914426
<SOS> one would think one was in the cave of ali baba . <EOS>	88.35806818218933
<SOS> what is there in them ? '' <EOS>	72.93990667887478
<SOS> he added , putting his lantern on one of the casks . <EOS>	83.93732451989366
<SOS> the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again , but controlling himself he answered : `` port wine . '' <EOS>	56.086167935132295
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	74.06881821549793
<SOS> port wine ! <EOS>	86.05320407590888
<SOS> 't is a comfort , '' said the gascon , `` since we shall not die of thirst . <EOS>	99.31969202376538
<SOS> are they all full ? '' <EOS>	54.3675238175447
<SOS> grimaud translated the question , and groslow , who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead , answered : `` some full , others empty . '' <EOS>	65.56595345363273
<SOS> d'artagnan struck the barrels with his hand , and having ascertained that he spoke the truth , pushed his lantern , greatly to the captain 's alarm , into the interstices between the barrels , and finding that there was nothing concealed in them : `` come along , '' he said ; and he went toward the door of the second compartment . <EOS>	79.22758814071652
<SOS> `` stop ! '' <EOS>	58.51679706719648
<SOS> said the englishman , `` i have the key of that door ; '' and he opened the door , with a trembling hand , into the second compartment , where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper . <EOS>	68.5936440149137
<SOS> here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment . <EOS>	96.98292678794157
<SOS> this was the room appropriated to the sailors . <EOS>	81.91487340792132
<SOS> two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling , a table and two benches composed the entire furniture . <EOS>	56.59446105602291
<SOS> d'artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls , and meeting nothing to suspect , regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel . <EOS>	49.99924724553029
<SOS> `` and this room ? '' <EOS>	57.109234114824815
<SOS> he asked , pointing to the captain 's cabin . <EOS>	59.2004501241504
<SOS> `` that 's my room , '' replied groslow . <EOS>	70.83542976847752
<SOS> `` open the door . '' <EOS>	67.46615208959125
<SOS> the captain obeyed . <EOS>	56.71748412187327
<SOS> d'artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern , put his head in at the half opened door , and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed : `` good , '' he said . <EOS>	67.76051528094942
<SOS> `` if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden . <EOS>	121.33056025192086
<SOS> let us see what porthos has found for supper . '' <EOS>	84.52354855543975
<SOS> and thanking the captain , he regained the state cabin , where his friends were . <EOS>	85.92880235147348
<SOS> porthos had found nothing , and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger . <EOS>	87.2750397645571
<SOS> he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d'artagnan returned . <EOS>	90.42922945664702
<SOS> athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes , which they half opened when their companion came in again . <EOS>	65.12385638627835
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	52.476736460305446
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	97.7378565022879
<SOS> `` all is well ; we may sleep tranquilly . '' <EOS>	111.80722340046384
<SOS> on this assurance the two friends fell asleep ; and d'artagnan , who was very weary , bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak , with naked sword at his side , in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage , and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him . <EOS>	81.09608610255714

<SOS> in ten minutes the masters slept ; not so the servants hungry , and more thirsty than hungry . <EOS>	60.25011349060329
<SOS> blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise . <EOS>	101.8705341564589
<SOS> on a hanging table , which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel , were a pot of beer and three glasses . <EOS>	67.78819474241986
<SOS> `` this cursed rolling ! '' <EOS>	119.30380587193811
<SOS> said blaisois . <EOS>	82.15272006830045
<SOS> `` i know it will serve me as it did when we came over . '' <EOS>	96.11846702376451
<SOS> `` and to think , '' said mousqueton , `` that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer . <EOS>	83.12761989584702
<SOS> pah ! '' <EOS>	104.74102115169174
<SOS> `` but where is your wicker flask , monsieur mousqueton ? <EOS>	109.57408932323087

<SOS> `` no , '' replied mousqueton , `` parry kept it . <EOS>	107.64718572236659
<SOS> those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty . <EOS>	53.09702048316304

<SOS> `` as thirsty as a scotchman ! '' <EOS>	84.488943729195
<SOS> was grimaud 's laconic reply . <EOS>	64.68485833167911
<SOS> and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party , whose money he managed . <EOS>	87.85846561019885
<SOS> `` oh , lackadaisy ! <EOS>	85.77065148222783

<SOS> `` if that 's the case , '' said mousqueton , with a learned air , `` take some nourishment . '' <EOS>	73.80337296086991
<SOS> `` do you call that nourishment ? '' <EOS>	70.11798667091892
<SOS> said blaisois , pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table . <EOS>	103.74436318156116
<SOS> `` blaisois , '' replied mousqueton , `` remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman , who is not always able to get bread , ask grimaud . '' <EOS>	101.32890282119878
<SOS> `` yes , but beer ? '' <EOS>	58.01385594358262
<SOS> asked blaisois sharply , `` is that their true drink ? '' <EOS>	48.681777063368905
<SOS> `` as to that , '' answered mousqueton , puzzled how to get out of the difficulty , `` i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english . '' <EOS>	76.24187718476092
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	50.67411366951242

<SOS> asked blaisois , `` i can ? <EOS>	81.51108542804383

<SOS> `` excellent ; there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux . '' <EOS>	73.48726523532399

<SOS> `` sell ! '' <EOS>	107.97940618146838

<SOS> `` one may well perceive , young man , that you are inexperienced . <EOS>	51.87029547817077

<SOS> `` where forbidden ? '' <EOS>	95.39420983746017

<SOS> `` yes , you talk like a child i repeat the word . <EOS>	69.12870360540786

<SOS> `` if you had been ten years engaged in war , as grimaud and i have been , my dear blaisois , you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies . <EOS>	52.63955753083897
<SOS> now an englishman is an enemy ; this port wine belongs to the english , therefore it belongs to us . '' <EOS>	86.41742832725461
<SOS> `` and our masters ? '' <EOS>	72.82999201642856
<SOS> asked blaisois , stupefied by this harangue , delivered with an air of profound sagacity , `` will they be of your opinion ? '' <EOS>	87.70615675221136
<SOS> mousqueton smiled disdainfully . <EOS>	62.29927842134353
<SOS> `` i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say , 'gentlemen , your servant , mousqueton , is thirsty . ' <EOS>	84.50280224212686

<SOS> `` were it liquid gold , monsieur blaisois , our masters would not deny themselves this wine . <EOS>	61.99988098234953

<SOS> his manner became more and more lofty every instant ; then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was . <EOS>	73.81498858080649
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	85.21533832274672

<SOS> `` locked ! '' <EOS>	39.947270465373016
<SOS> repeated mousqueton . <EOS>	62.29842225502968
<SOS> `` but , '' blaisois ventured to say , `` i have heard you relate , monsieur mousqueton , that once on a time , at chantilly , you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare , carp with a line , and bottles with a slipnoose . '' <EOS>	75.11821168523792
<SOS> `` perfectly true ; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles . <EOS>	108.19639305258497

<SOS> `` no , but you can take out two or three boards of the partition , '' answered blaisois , `` and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet . '' <EOS>	55.57088419163255
<SOS> mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost , astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit . <EOS>	92.83963011724855
<SOS> `` 't is true , '' he said ; `` but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out , a gimlet to pierce the cask ? '' <EOS>	75.58190553360487

<SOS> grimaud , in fact , was not only the accountant , but the armorer of the party ; and as he was a man full of forethought , these trousers , carefully rolled up in his valise , contained every sort of tool for immediate use . <EOS>	76.49578550457896
<SOS> mousqueton , therefore , was soon provided with tools and he began his task . <EOS>	100.62050011322923
<SOS> in a few minutes he had extracted three boards . <EOS>	81.07568096215888
<SOS> he tried to pass his body through the aperture , but not being like the frog in the fable , who thought he was larger than he really was , he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through . <EOS>	59.298389459968426
<SOS> he sighed and set to work again . <EOS>	54.188497231610654

<SOS> `` i could go in as well as grimaud , '' said mousqueton , a little piqued . <EOS>	64.49196573415965
<SOS> `` yes , but that would take too much time and i am thirsty . <EOS>	78.25037799151269
<SOS> i am getting more and more seasick . '' <EOS>	102.90525281729347
<SOS> `` go in , then , grimaud , '' said mousqueton , handing him the beer pot and gimlet . <EOS>	52.12778225680076
<SOS> `` rinse the glasses , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	48.27835486253462
<SOS> then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton , that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another , he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared . <EOS>	75.33883808222846
<SOS> blaisois was in a state of great excitement ; he was in ecstasies . <EOS>	83.53488005588558
<SOS> of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated , this seemed without question to be the most wonderful . <EOS>	53.116466455394146
<SOS> `` you are about to see , '' said mousqueton , looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning , `` you are about to see , blaisois , how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty . '' <EOS>	83.36427535386585
<SOS> `` my cloak , '' said grimaud , from the bottom of the hold . <EOS>	93.80311545510176
<SOS> `` what do you want ? '' <EOS>	53.7908545556421
<SOS> asked blaisois . <EOS>	92.08256651920391
<SOS> `` my cloak stop up the aperture with it . '' <EOS>	60.85277874918983
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	66.78277285127322
<SOS> asked blaisois . <EOS>	40.38663740296637
<SOS> `` simpleton ! '' <EOS>	96.06020158554018
<SOS> exclaimed mousqueton ; `` suppose any one came into the room . '' <EOS>	96.12151413487274
<SOS> `` ah , true , '' cried blaisois , with evident admiration ; `` but it will be dark in the cellar . '' <EOS>	81.6635508439008
<SOS> `` grimaud always sees , dark or light , night as well as day , '' answered mousqueton . <EOS>	72.57017233536708
<SOS> `` that is lucky , '' said blaisois . <EOS>	92.49592248726253
<SOS> `` as for me , when i have no candle i ca n't take two steps without knocking against something . '' <EOS>	66.79866008413056
<SOS> `` that 's because you have n't served , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	59.13390689992159
<SOS> `` had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven . <EOS>	113.98188635970317
<SOS> but hark ! <EOS>	100.65051323409165
<SOS> i think some one is coming . '' <EOS>	88.43580844238231
<SOS> mousqueton made , with a low whistling sound , the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth , resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example . <EOS>	61.4789306155913
<SOS> blaisois obeyed . <EOS>	82.44865802739416
<SOS> the door of their cabin was opened . <EOS>	85.88310751016675
<SOS> two men , wrapped in their cloaks , appeared . <EOS>	73.68228028990448
<SOS> `` oho ! '' <EOS>	81.92065834164652
<SOS> said they , `` not in bed at a quarter past eleven . <EOS>	82.0086838976988
<SOS> that 's against all rules . <EOS>	60.71874574380429
<SOS> in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring . '' <EOS>	68.7189340687792
<SOS> these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted ; opened the door , entered and shut it after them . <EOS>	52.40970446013001
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	55.30549745256585
<SOS> cried blaisois , `` he is lost ! '' <EOS>	61.04186648957669
<SOS> `` grimaud 's a cunning fellow , '' murmured mousqueton . <EOS>	90.52211774664026
<SOS> they waited for ten minutes , during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered , and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned , closed the door after them , and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights , disappeared . <EOS>	56.30473378248094
<SOS> `` shall we obey ? '' <EOS>	102.97094913248246
<SOS> asked blaisois . <EOS>	78.00631184600846
<SOS> `` all this looks suspicious . '' <EOS>	58.19491421218805
<SOS> `` they said a quarter of an hour . <EOS>	83.2405174580819
<SOS> we still have five minutes , '' replied mousqueton . <EOS>	91.54395611155597
<SOS> `` suppose we warn the masters . '' <EOS>	55.38117800317716
<SOS> `` let 's wait for grimaud . '' <EOS>	105.25284408353986
<SOS> `` but perhaps they have killed him . '' <EOS>	49.797591501144446
<SOS> `` grimaud would have cried out . '' <EOS>	104.71819369817582
<SOS> `` you know he is almost dumb . '' <EOS>	45.27302823583718
<SOS> `` we should have heard the blow , then . '' <EOS>	81.49980397625686
<SOS> `` but if he does n't return ? '' <EOS>	66.48949137842412
<SOS> `` here he is . '' <EOS>	63.40693765427657
<SOS> at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid , his eyes staring wide open with terror , so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing , with a large circle of white around them . <EOS>	87.21266836260422
<SOS> he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance , and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable : `` oh ! '' <EOS>	94.6920908220975
<SOS> with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started , alarmed , and blaisois was near fainting from fright . <EOS>	69.16940885531909
<SOS> both , however , cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder . <EOS>	54.933648661041936
<SOS> convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine , grimaud hastened to awake d'artagnan , who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place . <EOS>	63.26804649406132
<SOS> imposing silence , grimaud put out the little night lamp , then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant 's ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith . <EOS>	74.49009350703494
<SOS> this was the gist of his strange story : the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty . <EOS>	62.81089468448141
<SOS> he passed on to another it , also , was empty , but the third which he tried was , from the dull sound it gave out , evidently full . <EOS>	77.8376463081121
<SOS> at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet , when he found a spigot ; he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout ; something , whatever it was the cask contained , fell silently into the tankard . <EOS>	55.93319128184811
<SOS> whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions , the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak , came and stood just before the hogshead , behind which grimaud , on hearing him come in , instantly crept . <EOS>	52.2637484637106
<SOS> this was groslow . <EOS>	57.338063794803745
<SOS> he was accompanied by another man , who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up , resembling a washing line . <EOS>	89.95088006902529
<SOS> his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat . <EOS>	83.02126731507043
<SOS> grimaud , thinking that they had come , as he had , to try the port wine , effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one . <EOS>	102.01568326785898
<SOS> `` have you the wick ? '' <EOS>	83.35724835854799
<SOS> asked the one who carried the lantern . <EOS>	91.34751375538222
<SOS> `` here it is , '' answered the other . <EOS>	59.430145800389575
<SOS> at the voice of this last speaker , grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow . <EOS>	89.33229651761305
<SOS> he rose gently , so that his head was just above the round of the barrel , and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt . <EOS>	77.05437467112272
<SOS> `` how long will this fuse burn ? '' <EOS>	74.91118637730293
<SOS> asked this person . <EOS>	46.19075351647945
<SOS> `` about five minutes , '' replied the captain . <EOS>	65.03160966076996
<SOS> that voice also was known to grimaud . <EOS>	49.461485069005064
<SOS> he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow . <EOS>	73.38072925349938
<SOS> `` then tell the men to be in readiness do n't tell them why now . <EOS>	69.81205269138361
<SOS> when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men . <EOS>	79.64148534749263
<SOS> get down into the longboat . '' <EOS>	73.70652619594975
<SOS> `` that is , when i have lighted the match ? '' <EOS>	70.4313607662552
<SOS> `` i will undertake that . <EOS>	104.25960193565358
<SOS> i wish to be sure of my revenge . <EOS>	53.154395344928865
<SOS> are the oars in the boat ? '' <EOS>	61.24294993809092
<SOS> `` everything is ready . '' <EOS>	78.08897153930977
<SOS> `` 't is well . '' <EOS>	75.81281576267905
<SOS> mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot , in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match . <EOS>	66.43536397901899
<SOS> he then arose . <EOS>	64.96658327986056
<SOS> `` you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact , in twenty minutes . '' <EOS>	61.64751325256769
<SOS> `` i understand all perfectly , sir , '' replied groslow ; `` but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake ; would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train ? '' <EOS>	48.985672245360895
<SOS> `` my dear groslow , '' answered mordaunt , `` you know the french proverb , 'nothing one does not do one 's self is ever well done . ' <EOS>	73.55560350490636
<SOS> i shall abide by that rule . '' <EOS>	57.271454178870144
<SOS> grimaud had heard all this , if he had not understood it . <EOS>	89.99596337247593
<SOS> but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language . <EOS>	79.59774914942054
<SOS> he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers , had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse ; he had heard the proverb , which mordaunt had given in french . <EOS>	91.99826869882143
<SOS> then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand ; and , instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton , he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder . <EOS>	76.84933103150689
<SOS> mordaunt went away with the captain . <EOS>	49.4148791270387
<SOS> at the door he stopped to listen . <EOS>	54.028794749377155
<SOS> `` do you hear how they sleep ? '' <EOS>	102.61485465511498
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	69.0374812719501
<SOS> in fact , porthos could be heard snoring through the partition . <EOS>	59.41278757393695
<SOS> `` 't is god who gives them into our hands , '' answered groslow . <EOS>	72.7826283712919
<SOS> `` this time the devil himself shall not save them , '' rejoined mordaunt . <EOS>	45.80055254946723
<SOS> and they went out together . <EOS>	89.61916283001865
<SOS> chapter lxxii . <EOS>	74.96707326707856
<SOS> end of the port wine mystery . <EOS>	56.92874683019605
<SOS> grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture . <EOS>	96.78934022337276
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	58.31549554986749
<SOS> he said , wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead , `` how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty ! '' <EOS>	114.97485254504764
<SOS> he made haste to pass out by the opening , still thinking himself in a dream ; but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare . <EOS>	46.48068198182216
<SOS> it may be imagined that d'artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest ; before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis 's ear , and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement : `` chevalier , '' he said , `` get up and do n't make the least noise . '' <EOS>	80.54794820217208
<SOS> aramis awoke . <EOS>	78.24796312091075
<SOS> d'artagnan , pressing his hand , repeated his call . <EOS>	72.92761497600956
<SOS> aramis obeyed . <EOS>	75.04791150935887
<SOS> `` athos is near you , '' said d'artagnan ; `` warn him as i have warned you . '' <EOS>	83.38751879877631
<SOS> aramis easily aroused athos , whose sleep was light , like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution . <EOS>	64.32449341593428
<SOS> but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos . <EOS>	50.41651738072878
<SOS> he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep , which was very annoying to him , when d'artagnan , instead of explaining , closed his mouth with his hand . <EOS>	76.14864651348836
<SOS> then our gascon , extending his arms , drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another . <EOS>	61.79342869626197
<SOS> `` friends , '' he said , `` we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men . '' <EOS>	67.03958410765294
<SOS> `` bah ! '' <EOS>	59.60230750063651
<SOS> said athos , `` are you still afraid ? '' <EOS>	62.25140764496221
<SOS> `` do you know who is captain of this vessel ? '' <EOS>	66.84474710813004
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	87.78486896640415
<SOS> `` captain groslow . '' <EOS>	96.29690115261766
<SOS> the shudder of the three musketeers showed to d'artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them . <EOS>	104.98626398910312
<SOS> `` groslow ! '' <EOS>	60.96123427471138
<SOS> said aramis ; `` the devil ! <EOS>	86.80700052331139
<SOS> `` who is this groslow ? '' <EOS>	91.5344097763708
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	95.71238266933278
<SOS> `` i do n't remember him . '' <EOS>	62.15709895823127
<SOS> `` groslow is the man who broke parry 's head and is now getting ready to break ours . '' <EOS>	75.29063242505926
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	48.341349252545655
<SOS> oh ! '' <EOS>	74.38339391885977
<SOS> `` and do you know who is his lieutenant ? '' <EOS>	56.42109553309106
<SOS> `` his lieutenant ? <EOS>	66.07755666450457
<SOS> there is none , '' said athos . <EOS>	105.84003851107528
<SOS> `` they do n't have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four . '' <EOS>	98.58088497218175
<SOS> `` yes , but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind ; he has a lieutenant , and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt . '' <EOS>	74.06231097115912
<SOS> this time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out . <EOS>	84.91980177461501
<SOS> those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them ; the mere sound of it filled them with terror . <EOS>	85.10163132432183
<SOS> `` what shall we do ? '' <EOS>	91.41447046661496
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	41.03387410754589
<SOS> `` we must seize the felucca , '' said aramis . <EOS>	60.18888179364386
<SOS> `` and kill him , '' said porthos . <EOS>	69.64713571670978
<SOS> `` the felucca is mined , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	71.17367920971166
<SOS> `` those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder . <EOS>	98.0956432321796
<SOS> when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all , friends and foes ; and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell . '' <EOS>	74.0602004665347
<SOS> `` you have some plan , then ? '' <EOS>	59.47449042139961
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	70.42246920799006
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	65.92918551601751
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	85.87719929821104
<SOS> `` have you confidence in me ? '' <EOS>	66.0247849214303
<SOS> `` give your orders , '' said the three musketeers . <EOS>	65.05332398496105
<SOS> `` very well ; come this way . '' <EOS>	54.72013038788999
<SOS> d'artagnan went toward a very small , low window , just large enough to let a man through . <EOS>	103.2824586540377
<SOS> he turned it gently on its hinges . <EOS>	48.63607677737922
<SOS> `` there , '' he said , `` is our road . '' <EOS>	57.408477820843245
<SOS> `` the deuce ! <EOS>	56.56669021514007
<SOS> it is a very cold one , my dear friend , '' said aramis . <EOS>	74.63954647887938
<SOS> `` stay here , if you like , but i warn you 'twill be rather too warm presently . '' <EOS>	87.05257337042764
<SOS> `` but we can not swim to the shore . '' <EOS>	69.74811999951845
<SOS> `` the longboat is yonder , lashed to the felucca . <EOS>	71.94794939670355
<SOS> we will take possession of it and cut the cable . <EOS>	47.70000144431445
<SOS> come , my friends . '' <EOS>	110.83064412028382
<SOS> `` a moment 's delay , '' said athos ; `` our servants ? '' <EOS>	100.61927897135008
<SOS> `` here we are ! '' <EOS>	53.212803392166855
<SOS> they cried . <EOS>	86.20123897342177
<SOS> meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d'artagnan , in raising the shutters , had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window . <EOS>	81.27313199766019
<SOS> those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn , more striking , than the raging sea , rolling , with its deafening roar , its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon . <EOS>	83.5260425734769
<SOS> `` gracious heaven , we are hesitating ! '' <EOS>	79.93733969411399
<SOS> cried d'artagnan ; `` if we hesitate what will the servants do ? '' <EOS>	87.35175580614009
<SOS> `` i do not hesitate , you know , '' said grimaud . <EOS>	122.1640033888413
<SOS> `` sir , '' interposed blaisois , `` i warn you that i can only swim in rivers . '' <EOS>	46.03884292487557
<SOS> `` and i not at all , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	77.57704093934903
<SOS> but d'artagnan had now slipped through the window . <EOS>	62.57306362338823
<SOS> `` you have decided , friend ? '' <EOS>	83.44289953804419
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	81.85264867664173
<SOS> `` yes , '' the gascon answered ; `` athos ! <EOS>	94.83472441415536
<SOS> you , who are a perfect being , bid spirit triumph over body . <EOS>	90.0225589085815
<SOS> do you , aramis , order the servants . <EOS>	115.99801153433717
<SOS> porthos , kill every one who stands in your way . '' <EOS>	75.02487353736188
<SOS> and after pressing the hand of athos , d'artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward , so that he had only to plunge into the water , which was already up to his waist . <EOS>	79.45300006288136
<SOS> athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves ; the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea . <EOS>	46.080311601090536
<SOS> d'artagnan swam to it and held it , suspending himself by this rope , his head alone out of water . <EOS>	84.780096560328
<SOS> in one second athos joined him . <EOS>	49.51798447123682
<SOS> then they saw , as the felucca turned , two other heads peeping , those of aramis and grimaud . <EOS>	99.0918929514958
<SOS> `` i am uneasy about blaisois , '' said athos ; `` he can , he says , only swim in rivers . '' <EOS>	58.82286332927613
<SOS> `` when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere . <EOS>	56.22619186738666

<SOS> `` porthos is coming he swims like leviathan . '' <EOS>	46.549077734526165
<SOS> in fact , porthos did not appear ; for a scene , half tragedy and half comedy , had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois , who , frightened by the noise of the sea , by the whistling of the wind , by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them , shrank back instead of going forward . <EOS>	83.61706713999351
<SOS> `` come , come ! '' <EOS>	89.83580242985805
<SOS> said porthos ; `` jump in . '' <EOS>	83.50010450996699
<SOS> `` but , monsieur , '' said mousqueton , `` i ca n't swim ; let me stay here . '' <EOS>	52.86499341497322
<SOS> `` and me , too , monsieur , '' said blaisois . <EOS>	117.4445297909466
<SOS> `` i assure you , i shall be very much in the way in that little boat , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	71.0415153841097
<SOS> `` and i know i shall drown before reaching it , '' continued blaisois . <EOS>	64.05410101591711
<SOS> `` come along ! <EOS>	55.15845705890033
<SOS> i shall strangle you both if you do n't get out , '' said porthos at last , seizing mousqueton by the throat . <EOS>	103.91029760180132
<SOS> `` forward , blaisois ! '' <EOS>	89.3114379868608
<SOS> a groan , stifled by the grasp of porthos , was all the reply of poor blaisois , for the giant , taking him neck and heels , plunged him into the water headforemost , pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank . <EOS>	120.04341196673313
<SOS> `` now , mousqueton , '' he said , `` i hope you do n't mean to desert your master ? '' <EOS>	45.79788883211347
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' replied mousqueton , his eyes filling with tears , `` why did you re enter the army ? <EOS>	75.48304160670138
<SOS> we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds ! '' <EOS>	100.73337541879272
<SOS> and without any other complaint , passive and obedient , either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois , mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost . <EOS>	52.191117315951715
<SOS> a sublime action , at all events , for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead . <EOS>	63.94818801089133
<SOS> but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant , and when mousqueton rose above the water , blind as a new born puppy , he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled , without having occasion even to move , to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton . <EOS>	95.91943439964994
<SOS> in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions , who were already in the boat ; but when , after they had all got in , it came to his turn , there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel . <EOS>	49.46751910357163
<SOS> athos was the last to enter . <EOS>	52.853301480344555
<SOS> `` are you all here ? '' <EOS>	63.49631871683263
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	72.50656915427301
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	77.98973308543292
<SOS> have you your sword , athos ? '' <EOS>	78.15360840396662
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	86.46168867401477
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	78.70785623958808
<SOS> `` cut the cable , then . '' <EOS>	61.07945502229287
<SOS> athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord . <EOS>	89.67334916298772
<SOS> the felucca went on , the boat continued stationary , rocked only by the swashing waves . <EOS>	62.474106534156434
<SOS> `` come , athos ! '' <EOS>	49.79953807702885
<SOS> said d'artagnan , giving his hand to the count ; `` you are going to see something curious , '' added the gascon . <EOS>	103.24270897557275
<SOS> chapter lxiii . <EOS>	87.62218267670734
<SOS> fatality . <EOS>	60.131956330879035
<SOS> scarcely had d'artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca , which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night . <EOS>	44.493539019129464
<SOS> `` that , you may be sure , '' said the gascon , `` means something . '' <EOS>	67.2964617564456
<SOS> they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck , defining the forms of shadows behind it . <EOS>	82.11065953458338
<SOS> suddenly a terrible cry , a cry of despair , was wafted through space ; and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds , the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light . <EOS>	93.98401281288001
<SOS> shadows ran , as if bewildered , to and fro on the vessel , and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers . <EOS>	95.19332250792397
<SOS> in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand . <EOS>	49.59647139287507
<SOS> the agitated figures , apparently wild with terror , consisted of groslow , who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors . <EOS>	63.962977424437355
<SOS> mordaunt , after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep , had gone down into the cellar , convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber . <EOS>	57.53205423392255
<SOS> then he had run to the train , impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge , and full of confidence , as are those whom god blinds , he had set fire to the wick of nitre . <EOS>	76.36338370855323
<SOS> all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck . <EOS>	54.87981978047045
<SOS> `` haul up the cable and draw the boat to us , '' said groslow . <EOS>	79.04616873901035
<SOS> one of the sailors got down the side of the ship , seized the cable , and drew it ; it came without the least resistance . <EOS>	75.56749875759319
<SOS> `` the cable is cut ! '' <EOS>	70.52943307026132
<SOS> he cried , `` no boat ! '' <EOS>	58.10398286755947
<SOS> `` how ! <EOS>	109.40218834916688
<SOS> no boat ! '' <EOS>	63.056459324253346
<SOS> exclaimed groslow ; `` it is impossible . '' <EOS>	97.53455756650484
<SOS> `` 't is true , however , '' answered the sailor ; `` there 's nothing in the wake of the ship ; besides , here 's the end of the cable . '' <EOS>	83.57669391896339
<SOS> `` what 's the matter ? '' <EOS>	57.56370666170481
<SOS> cried mordaunt , who , coming up out of the hatchway , rushed to the stern , waving his torch . <EOS>	66.97530097468024
<SOS> `` only that our enemies have escaped ; they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat . '' <EOS>	84.31731819657892
<SOS> mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door . <EOS>	85.77219870075731
<SOS> `` empty ! '' <EOS>	68.9470752902342
<SOS> he exclaimed ; `` the infernal demons ! '' <EOS>	95.61855928995287
<SOS> `` we must pursue them , '' said groslow , `` they ca n't be gone far , and we will sink them , passing over them . '' <EOS>	100.78527643423675
<SOS> `` yes , but the fire , '' ejaculated mordaunt ; `` i have lighted it . '' <EOS>	66.1869325295299
<SOS> `` ten thousand devils ! '' <EOS>	67.23444812341849
<SOS> cried groslow , rushing to the hatchway ; `` perhaps there is still time to save us . '' <EOS>	88.13354926663428
<SOS> mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh , threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it . <EOS>	118.73596988742267
<SOS> the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano . <EOS>	98.88594198671528
<SOS> a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon ; the air burned , ignited by flaming embers , then the frightful lightning disappeared , the brands sank , one after another , into the abyss , where they were extinguished , and save for a slight vibration in the air , after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened . <EOS>	83.0584270806368
<SOS> only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed . <EOS>	81.95707406172875
<SOS> the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them . <EOS>	101.81528483455399
<SOS> at one moment , bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light , which illumined the sea for the space of a league , they might each be seen , each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which , even in their hearts of bronze , they could not help experiencing . <EOS>	51.78060682396036
<SOS> soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then , at last , the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean . <EOS>	56.2687174475423
<SOS> they sat silent and dejected . <EOS>	60.27256155635005
<SOS> `` by heaven ! '' <EOS>	79.45967284989241
<SOS> at last said athos , the first to speak , `` by this time , i think , all must be over . '' <EOS>	69.04834592406861
<SOS> `` here , my lords ! <EOS>	46.63167505317669
<SOS> save me ! <EOS>	84.86816436185562
<SOS> help ! '' <EOS>	49.36434770782168
<SOS> cried a voice , whose mournful accents , reaching the four friends , seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean . <EOS>	90.84018305721119
<SOS> all looked around ; athos himself stared . <EOS>	109.88047818052213
<SOS> `` 't is he ! <EOS>	56.69625271124989
<SOS> it is his voice ! '' <EOS>	114.75169128529213
<SOS> all still remained silent , the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared , endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness . <EOS>	103.82042884848937
<SOS> after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man , who approached them , swimming vigorously . <EOS>	56.918123633529866
<SOS> athos extended his arm toward him , pointing him out to his companions . <EOS>	95.41118086672786
<SOS> `` yes , yes , i see him well enough , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	121.61002463137736
<SOS> `` he again ! '' <EOS>	72.03687746584295
<SOS> cried porthos , who was breathing like a blacksmith 's bellows ; `` why , he is made of iron . '' <EOS>	76.57048911733719
<SOS> `` oh , my god ! '' <EOS>	107.8336983313541
<SOS> muttered athos . <EOS>	67.69605197403837
<SOS> aramis and d'artagnan whispered to each other . <EOS>	83.76212325177838
<SOS> mordaunt made several strokes more , and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves : `` pity , pity on me , gentlemen , in heaven 's name ! <EOS>	117.63527831714856
<SOS> my strength is failing me ; i am dying . '' <EOS>	54.470183048021525
<SOS> the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos . <EOS>	115.86539139667045
<SOS> `` poor fellow ! '' <EOS>	85.67234005172233
<SOS> he exclaimed . <EOS>	122.26559392297722
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	95.00452133213993
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy . <EOS>	54.39521992886139
<SOS> i believe he 's swimming toward us . <EOS>	69.09410929207976
<SOS> does he think we are going to take him in ? <EOS>	94.13257709420478
<SOS> row , porthos , row . '' <EOS>	67.24657269546125
<SOS> and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea ; two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further . <EOS>	93.8034053740431
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	73.10982978489248
<SOS> you will not abandon me ! <EOS>	70.7989027834828

<SOS> you will not be pitiless ! '' <EOS>	58.68321884981936

<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	57.60803734884182
<SOS> ah ! '' <EOS>	75.5808361825795
<SOS> said porthos to mordaunt , `` i think we have you now , my hero ! <EOS>	76.09385800260515
<SOS> and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell . '' <EOS>	58.18180819802765
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	65.30691409337427
<SOS> porthos ! '' <EOS>	117.08004837951509
<SOS> murmured the comte de la fere . <EOS>	84.99046031086716
<SOS> `` oh , pray , for mercy 's sake , do n't fly from me . <EOS>	58.94424997280402
<SOS> for pity 's sake ! '' <EOS>	79.4158058992883
<SOS> cried the young man , whose agony drawn breath at times , when his head went under water , under the wave , exhaled and made the icy waters bubble . <EOS>	102.57472063821453
<SOS> d'artagnan , however , who had consulted with aramis , spoke to the poor wretch . <EOS>	86.17422316001108
<SOS> `` go away , '' he said ; `` your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence . <EOS>	110.63904138402307
<SOS> see ! <EOS>	57.50249563197345
<SOS> the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking ; and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions . '' <EOS>	78.93557260177745
<SOS> `` sir ! '' <EOS>	57.952412771420654
<SOS> replied mordaunt , in a tone of deep despair , `` my penitence is sincere . <EOS>	68.57376221366678
<SOS> gentlemen , i am young , scarcely twenty three years old . <EOS>	90.12446110245045
<SOS> i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother . <EOS>	40.147298478011614
<SOS> you would have done what i did . '' <EOS>	46.11187464552762
<SOS> mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat , for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength . <EOS>	69.47461518445198
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	100.76736028508822
<SOS> he said , `` i am then to die ? <EOS>	57.80669301062673
<SOS> you are going to kill the son , as you killed the mother ! <EOS>	68.4779403635722
<SOS> surely , if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon , i ought to be forgiven . '' <EOS>	60.427411382349035
<SOS> then , as if his strength failed him , he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head , which drowned his voice . <EOS>	59.79917019062178
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	60.92079770007843
<SOS> this is torture to me , '' cried athos . <EOS>	60.85795722694006

<SOS> 't was the first time d'artagnan had ever refused a request from athos . <EOS>	94.87361038880276
<SOS> aramis calmly drew his sword , which he had carried between his teeth as he swam . <EOS>	87.42629959409776
<SOS> `` if he lays his hand on the boat 's edge i will cut it off , regicide that he is . '' <EOS>	69.53775298522667

<SOS> d'artagnan began to be touched . <EOS>	52.758282156604515
<SOS> the boat at this moment turned around , and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos . <EOS>	64.93395943214671
<SOS> `` monsieur the comte de la fere , '' he cried , `` i supplicate you ! <EOS>	48.7776513331131

<SOS> mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair . <EOS>	101.00921971829894
<SOS> `` that 's right , '' said athos ; `` put your other hand here . '' <EOS>	73.24896644260967
<SOS> and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support , so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt ; and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers . <EOS>	66.52142357083702
<SOS> `` now , sir , '' said the count , `` you are safe calm yourself . '' <EOS>	69.6012079429602

<SOS> and whilst d'artagnan uttered a cry , porthos raised the oar , and aramis sought a place to strike , a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea ; whilst mordaunt , with a shout of triumph , grasped the neck of his victim , and in order to paralyze his movements , twined arms and legs around the musketeer . <EOS>	61.64334418102274
<SOS> for an instant , without an exclamation , without a cry for help , athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters , but the weight dragged him down ; he disappeared by degrees ; soon nothing was to be seen except his long , floating hair ; then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water , which , in its turn , was soon effaced , alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk . <EOS>	54.1619967620021
<SOS> mute with horror , the three friends had remained open mouthed , their eyes dilated , their arms extended like statues , and , motionless as they were , the beating of their hearts was audible . <EOS>	66.30826101698992
<SOS> porthos was the first who came to himself . <EOS>	71.88340401277162

<SOS> at this instant , in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious , and first were seen , rising above the waves , a wisp of hair , then a pale face with open eyes , yet , nevertheless , the eyes of death ; then a body , which , after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea , turned gently on its back , according to the caprice of the waves , and floated . <EOS>	59.102302005209005
<SOS> in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard , the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams . <EOS>	91.37788742686756
<SOS> `` mordaunt ! <EOS>	64.92449059727754
<SOS> mordaunt ! '' <EOS>	69.8732772894338
<SOS> cried the three friends ; `` 't is mordaunt ! '' <EOS>	58.5266442970432
<SOS> `` but athos ! '' <EOS>	90.20620649855275
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan . <EOS>	105.09269373850154
<SOS> suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy ; every one turned around and beheld athos , livid , his eyes dim and his hands trembling , supporting himself on the edge of the boat . <EOS>	65.18266935888118
<SOS> eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat , where directly athos was warmed and reanimated , reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends , who were intoxicated with joy . <EOS>	95.07076043174872
<SOS> `` you are not hurt ? '' <EOS>	61.37107674953627
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	82.7935787127391
<SOS> `` no , '' replied athos ; `` and he `` `` oh , he ! <EOS>	84.2970946582566
<SOS> now we may say at last , thank heaven ! <EOS>	66.67060452281432
<SOS> he is really dead . <EOS>	66.09326471867165
<SOS> look ! '' <EOS>	51.1861685640763
<SOS> and d'artagnan , obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed , showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back , which , sometimes submerged , sometimes rising , seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred . <EOS>	86.20148602044242
<SOS> at last he sank . <EOS>	60.96956796420863
<SOS> athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed . <EOS>	80.20602972457458
<SOS> `` bravo ! <EOS>	71.98500430542391
<SOS> athos ! '' <EOS>	58.83581560949251
<SOS> cried aramis , with an emotion very rare in him . <EOS>	91.76568845498802
<SOS> `` a capital blow you gave ! '' <EOS>	62.21220770047037
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	42.394284287384835
<SOS> `` i have a son . <EOS>	43.96106885601458
<SOS> i wished to live , '' said athos . <EOS>	71.85881289779678
<SOS> `` in short , '' said d'artagnan , `` this has been the will of god . '' <EOS>	64.94707703343745
<SOS> `` it was not i who killed him , '' said athos in a soft , low tone , `` 't was destiny . '' <EOS>	97.76531877568715
<SOS> chapter lxiv . <EOS>	53.46960988023936
<SOS> how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten . <EOS>	90.77470601783112
<SOS> a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described . <EOS>	63.17130370842755
<SOS> the moon , which had shone for a short time , disappeared behind the clouds ; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert , the ocean , and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows . <EOS>	56.24023258436891
<SOS> porthos was the first to speak . <EOS>	109.69512820898419
<SOS> `` i have seen , '' he said , `` many dreadful things , but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed . <EOS>	92.51182189992426
<SOS> nevertheless , even in my present state of perturbation , i protest that i feel happy . <EOS>	90.25134296291435
<SOS> i have a hundred pounds ' weight less upon my chest . <EOS>	90.25963353497386
<SOS> i breathe more freely . '' <EOS>	78.39771619983524
<SOS> in fact , porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs . <EOS>	62.85890741807934
<SOS> `` for my part , '' observed aramis , `` i can not say the same as you do , porthos . <EOS>	57.279925463763036
<SOS> i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes . <EOS>	112.09788392293883
<SOS> i look around the boat , expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart . '' <EOS>	54.86526645523259
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	103.60056769106293
<SOS> i feel easy , '' replied porthos . <EOS>	67.42847320896101
<SOS> `` the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body . <EOS>	110.73293762912306
<SOS> i do not reproach you , athos , for what you have done . <EOS>	65.80946467991213
<SOS> on the contrary , when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike . <EOS>	92.20693619482505
<SOS> so now , i breathe again i am happy ! '' <EOS>	93.1909109113184
<SOS> `` do n't be in haste to celebrate a victory , porthos , '' interposed d'artagnan ; `` never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering . <EOS>	60.49330699386003
<SOS> men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements . <EOS>	103.29870820971297
<SOS> we are now on the sea , at night , without any pilot , in a frail bark ; should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost . '' <EOS>	102.25346836018328
<SOS> mousqueton heaved a deep sigh . <EOS>	71.65359447290015
<SOS> `` you are ungrateful , d'artagnan , '' said athos ; `` yes , ungrateful to providence , to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner . <EOS>	70.08267724448955
<SOS> let us sail before the wind , and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne . <EOS>	113.30784582353586
<SOS> should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers , able enough to turn it over again , or if not , to hold on by it . <EOS>	73.22314964866983
<SOS> now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take , 't is impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up . '' <EOS>	68.97974949314238
<SOS> `` but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north ? '' <EOS>	46.74507028758782
<SOS> `` that , '' said athos , `` would be quite another thing ; and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic . '' <EOS>	92.0103298186516
<SOS> `` which implies that we may die of hunger , '' said aramis . <EOS>	87.32823135304795
<SOS> `` 't is more than possible , '' answered the comte de la fere . <EOS>	52.76981420327521
<SOS> mousqueton sighed again , more deeply than before . <EOS>	52.77322271868119
<SOS> `` what is the matter ? <EOS>	76.2116412787502
<SOS> what ails you ? '' <EOS>	57.36845766501317
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	84.49155029017756
<SOS> `` i am cold , sir , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	73.05324716313697
<SOS> `` impossible ! <EOS>	95.59211152818176
<SOS> your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air . '' <EOS>	80.76343916933382
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	96.71910501648593
<SOS> sir , 't is this very coating of fat that makes me shiver . '' <EOS>	90.29164562586041
<SOS> `` how is that , mousqueton ? <EOS>	64.67174384159927
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	111.35167236572286
<SOS> your honor , in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels . '' <EOS>	58.30769098156707
<SOS> `` what then ? '' <EOS>	68.58756647514195
<SOS> `` amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv . '' <EOS>	40.57345430021858
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	66.08499696911447
<SOS> `` in these books , your honor , 't is told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with `` `` the fattest among them ! '' <EOS>	68.73744596328685
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing . <EOS>	60.4766568186603
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' answered mousqueton ; `` but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it . <EOS>	72.97498156916079
<SOS> however , '' he added , turning to porthos , `` i should not regret dying , sir , were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you . '' <EOS>	91.25222243334652
<SOS> `` mouston , '' replied porthos , much affected , `` should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm . '' <EOS>	83.76385957409505
<SOS> `` and you should call it 'devotion , ' '' added aramis ; `` the vineyard of self sacrifice , to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master . '' <EOS>	81.6444546038056
<SOS> `` chevalier , '' said d'artagnan , laughing , `` you could eat a piece of mouston , could n't you , especially after two or three days of fasting ? '' <EOS>	119.03205456688113
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' replied aramis , `` i should much prefer blaisois ; we have n't known him so long . '' <EOS>	84.29500178228744
<SOS> one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place , the servants , with the exception of grimaud , were not silent . <EOS>	92.83498623954922
<SOS> suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight , taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine ; and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles , bread , and a monster junk of salted beef . <EOS>	72.9777238619911
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	43.435299576010685
<SOS> he cried , passing the bottle to porthos , `` we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions . '' <EOS>	67.0081110563566
<SOS> this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety . <EOS>	101.9962993134225
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	64.49814713809647
<SOS> exclaimed porthos , `` 't is astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach . '' <EOS>	74.32060073302362
<SOS> and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat . <EOS>	57.832343411648885
<SOS> `` now , '' said athos , `` sleep , or try to sleep , my friends , and i will watch . '' <EOS>	60.95306435934256
<SOS> in a few moments , notwithstanding their wet clothes , the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror , these hardy adventurers , with their iron frames , inured to every hardship , threw themselves down , intending to profit by the advice of athos , who sat at the helm , pensively wakeful , guiding the little bark the way it was to go , his eyes fixed on the heavens , as if he sought to verify not only the road to france , but the benign aspect of protecting providence . <EOS>	114.02964042773509
<SOS> after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos . <EOS>	102.55660850838174
<SOS> dawn was shedding its pallid , placid glimmer on the purple ocean , when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass , above which gleamed a triangular sail ; then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save . <EOS>	79.79453534156201
<SOS> `` a bark ! '' <EOS>	47.014388311669144
<SOS> all cried together . <EOS>	54.08823318840093
<SOS> it was , in fact , a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne . <EOS>	76.58793093274097
<SOS> a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard . <EOS>	91.39620112157388
<SOS> grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain , and at nine o'clock in the morning , having a fair wind , our frenchmen set foot on their native land . <EOS>	64.01348772115378
<SOS> `` egad ! <EOS>	57.224752677905386
<SOS> how strong one feels here ! '' <EOS>	77.13671663323781
<SOS> said porthos , almost burying his large feet in the sands . <EOS>	54.73068645527648
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	89.88177099293846
<SOS> i could defy a nation ! '' <EOS>	78.210106114343
<SOS> `` be quiet , porthos , '' said d'artagnan , `` we are observed . '' <EOS>	40.29109686495012
<SOS> `` we are admired , i'faith , '' answered porthos . <EOS>	79.59115763536965
<SOS> `` these people who are looking at us are only merchants , '' said athos , `` and are looking more at the cargo than at us . '' <EOS>	94.83386905443915
<SOS> `` i shall not trust to that , '' said the lieutenant , `` and i shall make for the dunes * as soon as possible . '' <EOS>	71.7341432657692
<SOS> * sandy hills about dunkirk , from which it derives its name . <EOS>	75.00530419884448
<SOS> the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved . <EOS>	64.78470226790553
<SOS> here , after a short conference , they proposed to separate . <EOS>	57.505548990918044
<SOS> `` and why separate ? '' <EOS>	71.93338208691858
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	59.51352440240998
<SOS> `` because , '' answered the gascon , `` we were sent , porthos and i , by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell ; instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i. not the same thing by any means . <EOS>	77.06548873840757
<SOS> in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d'herblay our crime would be confirmed . <EOS>	54.85948235179929
<SOS> we have circumvented cromwell , mordaunt , and the sea , but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin . '' <EOS>	66.06093746883725
<SOS> `` you forget , '' replied athos , `` that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into . '' <EOS>	86.68655774229249
<SOS> `` truly , athos , '' interrupted d'artagnan , `` i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of . <EOS>	70.45411629152919
<SOS> chevalier , '' he continued , addressing aramis , who , leaning proudly on his sword , seemed to agree with his companion , `` chevalier , porthos and i run no risk ; besides , should any ill luck happen to two of us , will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended ? <EOS>	92.10002267833696
<SOS> besides , who knows whether , divided , we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen , we from mazarin which , were we all four together , would never be granted . <EOS>	68.61730228030454
<SOS> come , athos and aramis , go to the right ; porthos , come with me to the left ; these gentlemen should file off into normandy , whilst we , by the nearest road , reach paris . '' <EOS>	79.86161719106751
<SOS> he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route . <EOS>	47.96756437298076
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	79.13642094287927
<SOS> my dear friend , '' exclaimed athos , `` how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart . '' <EOS>	60.432241056028104
<SOS> and he gave him his hand . <EOS>	56.61279776874087
<SOS> `` is n't this fox a genius , athos ? '' <EOS>	94.96084038445717
<SOS> asked the gascon . <EOS>	55.78918969981929
<SOS> `` no ! <EOS>	118.31992069498482
<SOS> he knows how to crunch fowls , to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night , that 's all . <EOS>	76.12105824197474
<SOS> well , is all said ? '' <EOS>	72.60398762724397
<SOS> `` all . '' <EOS>	89.6192585266602

<SOS> `` come , come , d'artagnan , '' said athos , `` do not affect to be strong minded ; there are tears in your eyes . <EOS>	90.69832141490379
<SOS> let us be open with each other and sincere . '' <EOS>	49.80873680138567
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	52.838866556199896
<SOS> cried the gascon , `` do you think , athos , we can take leave , calmly , of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis ? '' <EOS>	60.89786472114079
<SOS> `` no , '' answered athos ; `` embrace me , my son . '' <EOS>	81.45832008228163
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	60.88044472208981
<SOS> said porthos , sobbing , `` i believe i 'm crying ; but how foolish all this is ! '' <EOS>	76.14201724943916
<SOS> then they embraced . <EOS>	83.80076833977006
<SOS> at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever , and when they parted , each to take the route agreed on , they turned back to utter affectionate expressions , which the echoes of the dunes repeated . <EOS>	59.700572545034326
<SOS> at last they lost sight of each other . <EOS>	59.58901834266958
<SOS> `` sacrebleu ! <EOS>	47.99414244963661
<SOS> d'artagnan , '' said porthos , `` i must out with it at once , for i ca n't keep to myself anything i have against you ; i have n't been able to recognize you in this matter . '' <EOS>	66.39375954072291
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	60.87009236568411
<SOS> said d'artagnan , with his wise smile . <EOS>	77.537919827109
<SOS> `` because if , as you say , athos and aramis are in real danger , this is not the time to abandon them . <EOS>	64.12784666150323
<SOS> for my part , i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them , in spite of all the mazarins in the world . '' <EOS>	85.4601763201828
<SOS> `` you would be right , porthos , but for one thing , which may change the current of your ideas ; and that is , that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger , it is ourselves ; it is not to abandon them that we have separated , but to avoid compromising them . '' <EOS>	63.99856354241565
<SOS> `` really ? '' <EOS>	89.99798336563794
<SOS> said porthos , opening his eyes in astonishment . <EOS>	58.47856101388339
<SOS> `` yes , no doubt . <EOS>	95.05872358551953

<SOS> `` bah ! <EOS>	66.89611792087221

<SOS> `` but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis ? '' <EOS>	79.06450241245317
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	110.72705941439355
<SOS> `` because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin ; because , going hence as emissaries to cromwell , we became partisans of king charles ; because , instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin , cromwell , joyce , bridge , fairfax , etc. , we very nearly succeeded in saving it . '' <EOS>	75.21938751166229
<SOS> `` upon my word that is true , '' said porthos ; `` but how can you suppose , my dear friend , that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think `` `` cromwell thinks of everything ; cromwell has time for everything ; and believe me , dear friend , we ought not to lose our time it is precious . <EOS>	58.23952539449989

<SOS> during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france , the parisians , finding themselves one morning without either queen or king , were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted , and the absence of mazarin , a thing so long desired , did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives . <EOS>	101.81790306576441
<SOS> the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain , was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone . <EOS>	76.29983285877667
<SOS> a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris ; but she not only declined to receive the deputies , but sent an intimation by chancellor seguier , implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel , paris would be besieged the very next day . <EOS>	91.72053259030703
<SOS> this threatening answer , unluckily for the court , produced quite a different effect to that which was intended . <EOS>	58.60641109850229
<SOS> it wounded the pride of the parliament , which , supported by the citizens , replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent ; denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state , and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward ; enjoining , in case of disobedience on his part , all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him . <EOS>	113.5479394680347
<SOS> mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law , preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen , to attack paris , by the citizens , to defend it . <EOS>	76.37625998410553
<SOS> the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets , when , headed by the coadjutor , appeared the prince de conti ( the brother of the prince de condé ) and the duc de longueville , his brother in law . <EOS>	75.34443963686371
<SOS> this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named , but not until after a stormy discussion , generalissimo of the army of the king , out of paris . <EOS>	54.66292189484066
<SOS> as for the duc de beaufort , he arrived from vendome , according to the annals of the day , bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair , qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces . <EOS>	97.84279297285926
<SOS> the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers . <EOS>	68.98759634202816
<SOS> on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie , more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention . <EOS>	96.82097320311179
<SOS> they carried a banner , on which could be read this strange device : `` we are seeking our king . '' <EOS>	62.94288856753449
<SOS> the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses . <EOS>	55.44531303716783
<SOS> that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february . <EOS>	92.92688739377422
<SOS> on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne , and , in two parties , had set out for paris . <EOS>	83.41463974451531
<SOS> toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre , which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts , fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen 's army . <EOS>	58.801448028150254
<SOS> it was against his will that athos took these precautions , but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent , that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission , which , received at the foot of the scaffold , could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta . <EOS>	56.55654305924322
<SOS> upon that , athos yielded . <EOS>	83.23662392126825
<SOS> on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms . <EOS>	49.24295049446719
<SOS> the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass , and called his sergeant . <EOS>	73.27845934453119
<SOS> the sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : `` who are you , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	53.91304533219826
<SOS> `` two gentlemen . '' <EOS>	68.86831064848356
<SOS> `` and where do you come from ? '' <EOS>	61.64550164485687
<SOS> `` from london . '' <EOS>	66.99818597126227
<SOS> `` and what are you going to do in paris ? '' <EOS>	63.99071638761707
<SOS> `` we are going with a mission to her majesty , the queen of england . '' <EOS>	70.51792384974712
<SOS> `` ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of england . <EOS>	117.93651685238736
<SOS> we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination , who are on their way to her majesty . <EOS>	76.71643743297578
<SOS> where are your passports ? '' <EOS>	55.26140942089434
<SOS> `` we have none ; we left england , ignorant of the state of politics here , having left paris before the departure of the king . '' <EOS>	60.036376584349284
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	57.13211767035404
<SOS> said the sergeant , with a cunning smile , `` you are mazarinists , who are sent as spies . '' <EOS>	63.349767590293375
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' here athos spoke , `` rest assured , if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport . <EOS>	83.02043657498041
<SOS> in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality . '' <EOS>	54.99164718115099
<SOS> `` enter the guardroom , '' said the sergeant ; `` we will lay your case before the commandant of the post . '' <EOS>	70.77090058401619
<SOS> the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people , some playing , some drinking , some talking . <EOS>	83.33179016159501
<SOS> in a corner , almost hidden from view , were three gentlemen , who had preceded athos and aramis , and an officer was examining their passports . <EOS>	83.28260021539974
<SOS> the first impulse of these three , and of those who last entered , was to cast an inquiring glance at each other . <EOS>	66.2978944725377
<SOS> the first arrivals wore long cloaks , in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped ; one of them , shorter than the rest , remained pertinaciously in the background . <EOS>	57.29414259338026
<SOS> when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists , it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass . <EOS>	65.85774000037196
<SOS> `` be it so , '' said athos ; `` yet it is probable , on the contrary , that we shall enter , because we seem to have to do with sensible people . <EOS>	40.53500887240347
<SOS> there seems to be only one thing to do , which is , to send our names to her majesty the queen of england , and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter . '' <EOS>	77.85787313257993
<SOS> on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on , wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before . <EOS>	105.50034941354684
<SOS> `` merciful goodness ! '' <EOS>	102.8915937394359
<SOS> whispered aramis to athos , `` did you see ? '' <EOS>	67.55381040072658
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	69.9794283347602
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	78.55201970021878
<SOS> `` the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	52.64961184363644
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	99.81410791574915
<SOS> `` he looked to me but 't is impossible . '' <EOS>	90.25432485326816
<SOS> at this instant the sergeant , who had been for his orders , returned , and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks , said : `` the passports are in order ; let these three gentlemen pass . '' <EOS>	45.0547476076948
<SOS> the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission . <EOS>	52.3283224461585
<SOS> aramis looked after them , and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos . <EOS>	65.45023598635635
<SOS> `` what is the matter with you , my friend ? '' <EOS>	93.54796469063356
<SOS> asked the latter . <EOS>	84.86936239566703
<SOS> `` i have doubtless i am dreaming ; tell me , sir , '' he said to the sergeant , `` do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out ? '' <EOS>	122.29858330265905
<SOS> `` only by their passports ; they are three frondists , who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville . '' <EOS>	63.6917775587219
<SOS> `` 't is strange , '' said aramis , almost involuntarily ; `` i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself . '' <EOS>	67.664385834157
<SOS> the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter . <EOS>	63.85777188209633
<SOS> `` he ! '' <EOS>	122.2833861450023
<SOS> he cried ; `` he venture himself amongst us , to be hung ! <EOS>	80.74863627867077
<SOS> not so foolish as all that . '' <EOS>	58.696008305365865
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	92.07633901138091
<SOS> muttered athos , `` i may be mistaken , i have n't the unerring eye of d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	52.568857290858816
<SOS> `` who is speaking of monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	68.61456824144524
<SOS> asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room . <EOS>	90.70047209496005
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	85.27664580824843
<SOS> cried aramis and athos , `` what ! <EOS>	99.65064571271708
<SOS> planchet ! '' <EOS>	70.5722332379548
<SOS> `` planchet , '' added grimaud ; `` planchet , with a gorget , indeed ! '' <EOS>	51.73304510771522
<SOS> `` ah , gentlemen ! '' <EOS>	73.80073596886518
<SOS> cried planchet , `` so you are back again in paris . <EOS>	53.01618827620299
<SOS> oh , how happy you make us ! <EOS>	71.42658705865101
<SOS> no doubt you come to join the princes ! '' <EOS>	56.918150820926144
<SOS> `` as thou seest , planchet , '' said aramis , whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton , bazin and grimaud . <EOS>	87.80777546911223
<SOS> `` and monsieur d'artagnan , of whom you spoke just now , monsieur d'herblay ; may i ask if you have any news of him ? '' <EOS>	84.98071990256322
<SOS> `` we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us . '' <EOS>	44.60736311371007
<SOS> `` no , sir ; i am sure he has n't yet arrived . <EOS>	83.8354866993916
<SOS> but then he may have stopped at saint germain . '' <EOS>	95.00361211969191
<SOS> `` i do n't think so ; we appointed to meet at la chevrette . '' <EOS>	73.906767220822
<SOS> `` i was there this very day . '' <EOS>	91.05733041658233
<SOS> `` and had the pretty madeleine no news ? '' <EOS>	59.04049218170738
<SOS> asked aramis , smiling . <EOS>	89.98986715129628
<SOS> `` no , sir , and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious . '' <EOS>	94.68577352928888
<SOS> `` in fact , '' said aramis , `` there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly . <EOS>	75.10677215115145
<SOS> permit me , then , my dear athos , without inquiring further about our friend , to pay my respects to m . <EOS>	70.73235917163323
<SOS> planchet . '' <EOS>	72.39811906449563
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur le chevalier , '' said planchet , bowing . <EOS>	71.69998666929231
<SOS> `` lieutenant ? '' <EOS>	65.3510669983151
<SOS> asked aramis . <EOS>	108.4362122509429
<SOS> `` lieutenant , with a promise of becoming captain . '' <EOS>	68.22380985403215
<SOS> `` 't is capital ; and pray , how did you acquire all these honors ? '' <EOS>	79.83183035401274
<SOS> `` in the first place , gentlemen , you know that i was the means of monsieur de rochefort 's escape ; well , i was very near being hung by mazarin and that made me more popular than ever . '' <EOS>	92.01053733442737
<SOS> `` so , owing to your popularity `` `` no ; thanks to something better . <EOS>	62.818527227977754
<SOS> you know , gentlemen , that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant ? '' <EOS>	75.9961169659963
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	119.37324568813932
<SOS> `` well , one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens , who began to march , some with the right foot , others with the left , i succeeded , i did , in making them all begin with the same foot , and i was made lieutenant on the spot . '' <EOS>	69.30417144348233
<SOS> `` so i presume , '' said athos , `` that you have a large number of the nobles with you ? '' <EOS>	75.34744549192328
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	51.76693377317369
<SOS> there are the prince de conti , the duc de longueville , the duc de beaufort , the duc de bouillon , the marechal de la mothe , the marquis de sevigne , and i do n't know who , for my part . '' <EOS>	81.70907145932335
<SOS> `` and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne ? '' <EOS>	78.30990455183705
<SOS> inquired athos , in a tremulous voice . <EOS>	113.88255534445938
<SOS> `` d'artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care , in parting . '' <EOS>	98.29552304423092
<SOS> `` yes , count ; nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since . '' <EOS>	76.1034686397376
<SOS> `` then , '' said athos in a tone of delight , `` he is well ? <EOS>	85.01475845019475
<SOS> no accident has happened to him ? '' <EOS>	70.65370978788165
<SOS> `` none , sir . '' <EOS>	50.608852787356206
<SOS> `` and he lives ? '' <EOS>	107.71592748474626
<SOS> `` still at the hotel of the great charlemagne . '' <EOS>	94.97790789528061
<SOS> `` and passes his time ? '' <EOS>	55.31667470925888
<SOS> `` sometimes with the queen of england , sometimes with madame de chevreuse . <EOS>	51.48321281165418
<SOS> he and the count de guiche are like each other 's shadows . '' <EOS>	89.04207282940133
<SOS> `` thanks , planchet , thanks ! '' <EOS>	78.8143930202008
<SOS> cried athos , extending his hand to the lieutenant . <EOS>	85.66700990058905
<SOS> `` oh , sir ! '' <EOS>	63.43862036394305
<SOS> planchet only touched the tips of the count 's fingers . <EOS>	100.73065677668451
<SOS> `` well , what are you doing , count to a former lackey ? <EOS>	66.33044491974002
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said athos , `` he has given me news of raoul . '' <EOS>	98.21756532136571
<SOS> `` and now , gentlemen , '' said planchet , who had not heard what they were saying , `` what do you intend to do ? '' <EOS>	60.7859871717463
<SOS> `` re enter paris , if you will let us , my good planchet . '' <EOS>	74.51531649256115
<SOS> `` let you , sir ? <EOS>	120.73146722679525
<SOS> now , as ever , i am nothing but your servant . '' <EOS>	73.52359746730194
<SOS> then turning to his men : `` allow these gentlemen to pass , '' he said ; `` they are friends of the duc de beaufort . '' <EOS>	57.62212664164629
<SOS> `` long live the duc de beaufort ! '' <EOS>	65.31106894240578
<SOS> cried the sentinels . <EOS>	65.45712184389244
<SOS> the sergeant drew near to planchet . <EOS>	83.68406536250603
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	84.63398907636234
<SOS> without passports ? '' <EOS>	82.93011244196937
<SOS> he murmured . <EOS>	89.15218128732263
<SOS> `` without passports , '' said planchet . <EOS>	88.08080368917426
<SOS> `` take notice , captain , '' he continued , giving planchet his expected title , `` take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen . '' <EOS>	97.49799021323982
<SOS> `` and i , '' said planchet , with dignity , `` i know them and i answer for them . '' <EOS>	79.45815637581585
<SOS> as he said this , he pressed grimaud 's hand , who seemed honored by the distinction . <EOS>	68.20041454565575
<SOS> `` farewell till we meet again , '' said aramis , as they took leave of planchet ; `` if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it . '' <EOS>	119.34604927925002
<SOS> `` sir , '' said planchet , `` i am in all things at your service . '' <EOS>	86.21524069717127
<SOS> `` that fellow is no fool , '' said aramis , as he got on his horse . <EOS>	100.65224603145136
<SOS> `` how should he be ? '' <EOS>	74.3189595389721
<SOS> replied athos , whilst mounting also , `` seeing he was used so long to brush your hats . '' <EOS>	91.93115820471826
<SOS> chapter lxxvi . <EOS>	52.99772835731083
<SOS> the ambassadors . <EOS>	81.10782762418944
<SOS> the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg , but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers , and the open places lakes ; after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital . <EOS>	76.64773037413099
<SOS> the two gentlemen were obliged , therefore , to get off their horses and take a boat ; and in that strange manner they approached the louvre . <EOS>	83.03492290060284
<SOS> night had closed in , and paris , seen thus , by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water , crowded with ferry boats of every kind , including those that glittered with the armed patrols , with the watchword , passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis , a man most susceptible to warlike impressions . <EOS>	83.40096302077903
<SOS> they reached the queen 's apartments , but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber , since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england . <EOS>	102.45934096302723
<SOS> `` we , too , '' said athos , to the footman who had given him that answer , `` not only bring news from england , but have just come from there . '' <EOS>	74.62802428734086
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	75.69293295049003
<SOS> then , are your names , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	69.98824999525415
<SOS> `` the comte de la fere and the chevalier d'herblay , '' said aramis . <EOS>	86.30651819581593
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	52.83252190431474
<SOS> in that case , gentlemen , '' said the footman , on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope , `` in that case it is another thing , and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment . <EOS>	84.45157301280673
<SOS> please follow me , '' and he went on before , followed by athos and aramis . <EOS>	83.6585530202333
<SOS> on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door : `` madame , '' he said , `` i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders , when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d'herblay . '' <EOS>	50.5520454406039
<SOS> on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy , which the two gentlemen heard . <EOS>	104.38181049041467
<SOS> `` poor queen ! '' <EOS>	92.74600719249894
<SOS> murmured athos . <EOS>	42.86469178435299
<SOS> `` oh , let them come in ! <EOS>	93.05047555029222
<SOS> let them come in , '' cried the young princess , bounding to the door . <EOS>	104.00800864216646
<SOS> the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter . <EOS>	61.77611094171202
<SOS> `` come in , gentlemen , '' repeated the princess , opening the door herself . <EOS>	79.09424428295162
<SOS> the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen , and among them the duc de chatillon , the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville , on the place royale . <EOS>	91.86479946941435
<SOS> all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse , and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone . <EOS>	73.87585293652852
<SOS> `` well , sirs ! '' <EOS>	119.56082386161555
<SOS> cried the queen , on perceiving the two friends , `` you have come , faithful friends ! <EOS>	55.545198102559254
<SOS> but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you , and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon , who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria , the very latest intelligence . '' <EOS>	68.08140368354097
<SOS> aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness , even the gayety of the queen 's manner . <EOS>	66.97026502653935
<SOS> `` go on with your recital , sirs , '' said the queen , turning to the duc de chatillon . <EOS>	61.69104548266033
<SOS> `` you said that his majesty , king charles , my august consort , had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects ! '' <EOS>	79.23757663721643
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' chatillon stammered out . <EOS>	76.75092885617141
<SOS> athos and aramis were more and more astonished . <EOS>	47.493014775955245
<SOS> `` and that being conducted to the scaffold , '' resumed the queen `` oh , my lord ! <EOS>	96.69398173394042
<SOS> oh , my king ! <EOS>	63.5260605566301

<SOS> `` just so madame , '' replied chatillon , in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation . <EOS>	110.42425389709578
<SOS> the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude , whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother 's neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears . <EOS>	70.16423238390641
<SOS> `` now , madame , nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage , '' said chatillon , who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos . <EOS>	121.35710576262096
<SOS> `` one moment , yes , '' answered the queen . <EOS>	66.95437662695011
<SOS> `` one moment i beg for here are the chevalier d'herblay and the comte de la fere , just arrived from london , and they can give you , as eye witnesses , such details as you can convey to the queen , my royal sister . <EOS>	69.60711914835011
<SOS> speak , gentlemen , speak i am listening ; conceal nothing , gloss over nothing . <EOS>	42.628453283253236
<SOS> since his majesty still lives , since the honor of the throne is safe , everything else is a matter of indifference to me . '' <EOS>	104.09065209332526
<SOS> athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart . <EOS>	86.72766685846231
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	63.75539514340701
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , who remarked this movement and his paleness . <EOS>	70.14342843800542
<SOS> `` speak , sir ! <EOS>	82.7310727546895
<SOS> i beg you to do so . '' <EOS>	112.88254578801384
<SOS> `` i beg you to excuse me , madame ; i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken . '' <EOS>	97.8098087659123
<SOS> `` mistaken ! '' <EOS>	89.51194036170048
<SOS> cried the queen , almost suffocated by emotion ; `` mistaken ! <EOS>	59.23616161255041
<SOS> what has happened , then ? '' <EOS>	95.85991210671331
<SOS> `` sir , '' interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos , `` if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen . <EOS>	113.39487347926068
<SOS> i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty , queen anne , of falsehood . '' <EOS>	82.07325648829915
<SOS> `` with the queen , sir ? '' <EOS>	72.75010354024629
<SOS> replied athos , in his calm , vibrating voice . <EOS>	59.603334174721354
<SOS> `` yes , '' murmured flamarens , lowering his eyes . <EOS>	54.27766185158707
<SOS> athos sighed deeply . <EOS>	67.72563940762754
<SOS> `` or rather , sir , '' said aramis , with his peculiar irritating politeness , `` the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom ; for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken , we saw you in the company of a third gentleman . '' <EOS>	96.79933272145773
<SOS> chatillon and flamarens started . <EOS>	87.19864246737835
<SOS> `` explain yourself , count ! '' <EOS>	64.32169551963695
<SOS> cried the queen , whose anxiety grew greater every moment . <EOS>	66.73948924981347
<SOS> `` on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble . <EOS>	60.33435569155789
<SOS> oh , my god ! <EOS>	101.41953116085084
<SOS> my god ! <EOS>	54.645005756364824
<SOS> what has happened ? '' <EOS>	104.96869324065645
<SOS> `` lord ! '' <EOS>	71.93952062511616
<SOS> ejaculated the young princess , falling on her knees , `` have mercy on us ! '' <EOS>	85.39219517695075
<SOS> `` sir , '' said chatillon , `` if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen . '' <EOS>	76.97772093176906
<SOS> aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him . <EOS>	83.14759217228413
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he , with compressed lips and flashing eyes , `` you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here ? '' <EOS>	48.0178306717851
<SOS> during this brief altercation athos , with his hands on his heart , his head bent low , approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said : `` madame , princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank , for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes . <EOS>	45.20046169815634
<SOS> we ought not , therefore , i think , to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition . <EOS>	84.07240386664174
<SOS> queen , destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth , hear the result of our unhappy mission . '' <EOS>	79.61453666831197
<SOS> athos , kneeling down before the queen , trembling and very cold , drew from his bosom , inclosed in the same case , the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i. before his death had placed in the hands of aramis . <EOS>	104.17938953490143
<SOS> since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them . <EOS>	86.83594215803608
<SOS> he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish . <EOS>	68.48152148557857
<SOS> the queen stretched out her hand , seized the ring , pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh , to give vent to a sob , she extended her arms , became deadly pale , and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter . <EOS>	43.11358052631326
<SOS> athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising , with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around : `` i , the comte de la fere , a gentleman who has never deceived any human being , swear before god and before this unhappy queen , that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground . <EOS>	69.05032595465029
<SOS> now , chevalier , '' he added , turning to aramis , `` let us go . <EOS>	109.85649217052583
<SOS> our duty is fulfilled . '' <EOS>	78.76532508146752
<SOS> `` not yet . '' <EOS>	81.99866523567876
<SOS> said aramis ; `` we have still a word to say to these gentlemen . '' <EOS>	106.08236767317014
<SOS> and turning to chatillon : `` sir , be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen . '' <EOS>	77.5693137674394
<SOS> chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out , stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor . <EOS>	70.27479438610709
<SOS> `` sir , '' said aramis , `` you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner . <EOS>	98.60377039622456
<SOS> that would not be endurable in any case , and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar . '' <EOS>	86.80228800892331
<SOS> `` sir ! '' <EOS>	114.30179981302443
<SOS> cried de chatillon . <EOS>	99.3266384194653
<SOS> `` what have you done with monsieur de bruy ? <EOS>	82.27454105517364
<SOS> has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin ? <EOS>	63.349339885769865
<SOS> there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal , from harlequin even to pantaloon . '' <EOS>	65.33916785456911
<SOS> `` chevalier ! <EOS>	59.56266362590682
<SOS> chevalier ! '' <EOS>	64.78137705479924
<SOS> said athos . <EOS>	80.14480045498905
<SOS> `` leave me alone , '' said aramis impatiently . <EOS>	96.42937790295792
<SOS> `` you know well that i do n't like to leave things half finished . '' <EOS>	107.16248347128199
<SOS> `` conclude , then , sir , '' answered de chatillon , with as much hauteur as aramis . <EOS>	53.13848580477692
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' resumed aramis , `` any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course . <EOS>	90.1422634106926
<SOS> come and converse with us for just five minutes , sword in hand , upon this deserted terrace . '' <EOS>	95.1586452632689
<SOS> `` one moment , gentlemen , '' cried flamarens . <EOS>	63.28902773297705
<SOS> `` i know well that the proposition is tempting , but at present it is impossible to accept it . '' <EOS>	64.7983499912163
<SOS> `` and why not ? '' <EOS>	89.21685000010504
<SOS> said aramis , in his tone of raillery . <EOS>	68.71342804347474
<SOS> `` is it mazarin 's proximity that makes you so prudent ? '' <EOS>	58.661829212881784
<SOS> `` oh , you hear that , flamarens ! '' <EOS>	48.88730628155448
<SOS> said chatillon . <EOS>	67.39356844117417
<SOS> `` not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor . '' <EOS>	42.06058741550417
<SOS> `` that is my opinion , '' said aramis . <EOS>	90.84788184809015
<SOS> `` you will not reply , however , and these gentlemen , i am sure , will presently be of my opinion . '' <EOS>	81.74375798414854
<SOS> aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence . <EOS>	84.22993766648001
<SOS> chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword . <EOS>	65.69546292868577
<SOS> `` willingly , '' replied de chatillon . <EOS>	85.54275971218684
<SOS> `` duke , '' said flamarens , `` you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance , projected by the prince , assented to by the queen . <EOS>	83.75682309395852
<SOS> until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal . '' <EOS>	87.611110996538
<SOS> `` let it be then the day after to morrow , '' said aramis . <EOS>	47.012044374007154
<SOS> `` to morrow , rather , '' said de chatillon , `` if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton . '' <EOS>	68.53853846777444
<SOS> `` how can you doubt it , sir ? <EOS>	54.36223262787404
<SOS> for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world . '' <EOS>	63.54372604115051
<SOS> `` very well , to morrow , sir . '' <EOS>	80.00660660222206
<SOS> `` i shall rely on it . <EOS>	74.67645820021494
<SOS> are you going to rejoin your cardinal ? <EOS>	116.18245054080717

<SOS> `` conditions ? '' <EOS>	120.23990112538604
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	60.45338313218856
<SOS> `` because it is for victors to make conditions , and you are not yet victors , gentlemen . '' <EOS>	67.68372293775927
<SOS> `` then let us draw on the spot . <EOS>	100.20370173286727
<SOS> it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow 's expedition . '' <EOS>	53.53563824514639
<SOS> chatillon and flamarens looked at each other . <EOS>	62.01222679282572
<SOS> there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger , but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying : `` you promise , sir that 's agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton ? '' <EOS>	74.5402719828364
<SOS> `` oh , do n't be afraid , sir , '' replied aramis ; and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre . <EOS>	73.52339588812886
<SOS> `` for what reason is all this fume and fury ? '' <EOS>	61.35661647405016
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	101.88579721628533
<SOS> `` what have they done to you ? '' <EOS>	73.44701522928035
<SOS> `` they did you not see what they did ? '' <EOS>	44.355439095446336
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	75.62267301752733
<SOS> `` they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england . <EOS>	84.87091585734477
<SOS> now , if they believed us , they laughed in order to insult us ; if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more . <EOS>	49.37577719269041
<SOS> however , i 'm glad not to fight them until to morrow . <EOS>	102.36362223579883
<SOS> i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword . '' <EOS>	53.60402147536139
<SOS> `` what have we to do ? '' <EOS>	54.074289982102094
<SOS> `` egad ! <EOS>	71.48147503731325
<SOS> to take mazarin . '' <EOS>	94.25396229863837
<SOS> athos curled his lip with disdain . <EOS>	66.26033268009638
<SOS> `` these undertakings do not suit me , as you know , aramis . '' <EOS>	66.0696159748122
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	104.95988187738486
<SOS> `` because it is taking people unawares . '' <EOS>	72.38042126622221
<SOS> `` really , athos , you would make a singular general . <EOS>	61.420391142657024
<SOS> you would fight only by broad daylight , warn your foe before an attack , and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness . '' <EOS>	108.3581779947802
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	88.16369545153073
<SOS> `` you know one can not change his nature , '' he said . <EOS>	89.96762866414922
<SOS> `` besides , do you know what is our situation , and whether mazarin 's arrest would n't be rather an encumbrance than an advantage ? '' <EOS>	76.14757351740658
<SOS> `` say at once you disapprove of my proposal . '' <EOS>	73.6784387771736
<SOS> `` i think you ought to do nothing , since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france . '' <EOS>	71.66811875776804
<SOS> `` i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free . <EOS>	87.33520323200683
<SOS> come , come . '' <EOS>	48.05701777646886
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	70.14845105416099
<SOS> `` either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon , and to tell them about this . '' <EOS>	83.28734690416141
<SOS> `` yes , but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor . <EOS>	68.80947720834432
<SOS> he is a priest , learned in cases of conscience , and we will tell him ours . '' <EOS>	63.36479467912654
<SOS> it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon , as his house came first ; but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne , to see raoul . <EOS>	81.92611114187196
<SOS> they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles ; and taking up grimaud and blaisois , they went on foot to the rue guenegaud . <EOS>	71.98165674409661
<SOS> but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne . <EOS>	57.661972293712005
<SOS> he had received a message from the prince , to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it . <EOS>	58.73113156036118
<SOS> chapter lxxvii . <EOS>	42.77982971634982
<SOS> the three lieutenants of the generalissimo . <EOS>	78.79980942458593
<SOS> the night was dark , but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege . <EOS>	74.49448015615715
<SOS> athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades , who demanded the watchword ; and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them , but in fact as a spy over their movements . <EOS>	113.62571936830084
<SOS> on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers , who seemed to know every possible password ; for they walked without either guide or escort , and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them , who instantly let them pass with evident deference , due probably to their high birth . <EOS>	102.82549573733247
<SOS> on seeing them athos and aramis stood still . <EOS>	98.49879867992058
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	64.89614740412551
<SOS> cried aramis , `` do you see , count ? '' <EOS>	56.81368178177399
<SOS> `` yes , '' said athos . <EOS>	86.3653922136263
<SOS> `` who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be ? '' <EOS>	98.81502773343941
<SOS> `` what do you think , aramis ? '' <EOS>	58.07345048112391
<SOS> `` why , they are our men . '' <EOS>	64.8352596492176
<SOS> `` you are not mistaken ; i recognize monsieur de flamarens . '' <EOS>	53.855452921354576
<SOS> `` and i , monsieur de chatillon . '' <EOS>	83.57957854397752
<SOS> `` as to the cavalier in the brown cloak `` `` it is the cardinal . '' <EOS>	57.361479994898566
<SOS> `` in person . '' <EOS>	67.1999381864454
<SOS> `` how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon ? '' <EOS>	74.71358862991534
<SOS> athos smiled , but did not reply . <EOS>	72.63015172331703
<SOS> five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince 's door . <EOS>	93.00341920125322
<SOS> this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard , ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti 's lieutenant . <EOS>	82.28910523467256
<SOS> monsieur de bouillon had the gout , but notwithstanding his illness , which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is , since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d'herblay . <EOS>	74.86792928643938
<SOS> he was in bed , but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war . <EOS>	76.83425688137639
<SOS> everywhere were swords , pistols , cuirasses , and arquebuses , and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel . <EOS>	82.70044198837493
<SOS> meanwhile , to his great regret , as he said , he was obliged to keep his bed . <EOS>	66.46071402557651
<SOS> `` ah , gentlemen , '' he cried , as the two friends entered , `` you are very happy ! <EOS>	96.59707290837771

<SOS> `` thanks , gentlemen , thanks ! <EOS>	78.76381539840614

<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	99.8444714832935
<SOS> `` pooh ! '' <EOS>	49.177754516893756
<SOS> said the duke , too much astonished to believe it true . <EOS>	80.14240267236534
<SOS> `` dead on the scaffold ; condemned by parliament . '' <EOS>	104.83629105975278
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	86.137023048368

<SOS> `` yes , he has just gone out . '' <EOS>	66.11363392914096
<SOS> athos smiled . <EOS>	88.06306522928448
<SOS> `` with two companions ? '' <EOS>	56.291280501865586
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	53.10828216362232
<SOS> `` with two companions , yes , '' replied the duke . <EOS>	77.7755095538585
<SOS> then he added with a certain uneasiness , `` did you meet them ? '' <EOS>	78.79868958567508
<SOS> `` why , yes , i think so in the street , '' said athos ; and he looked smilingly at aramis , who looked at him with an expression of surprise . <EOS>	55.05361385594558
<SOS> `` the devil take this gout ! '' <EOS>	57.31215859594075
<SOS> cried monsieur de bouillon , evidently ill at ease . <EOS>	62.143711617393194
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said athos , `` we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused , in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill , in so much pain . '' <EOS>	117.75385816205976
<SOS> `` one must , '' replied monsieur de bouillon , `` sacrifice one 's comfort to the public good ; but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted . <EOS>	74.66622800517193
<SOS> my spirit is willing , my head is clear , but this demon , the gout , o'ercrows me . <EOS>	51.11409996428251
<SOS> i confess , if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince , and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might .

<SOS> at this very moment the court is making overtures to me ; hitherto i have repulsed them ; but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so , i 've a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now . '' <EOS>	88.64477670688798
<SOS> `` accept it , my lord , accept it , '' said aramis . <EOS>	61.148366122201494
<SOS> `` faith ! <EOS>	101.246809576226
<SOS> yes . <EOS>	99.62094337859484
<SOS> i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see . '' <EOS>	51.84039120701084
<SOS> the two friends saluted the duke . <EOS>	49.12974784454851
<SOS> `` go , gentlemen , '' he said ; `` you must be much fatigued after your voyage . <EOS>	47.48241109261214
<SOS> poor king charles ! <EOS>	102.8644314509245
<SOS> but , after all , he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him . '' <EOS>	74.74895418558496
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	52.61864724371516
<SOS> as to that , '' said aramis , `` we are witnesses . <EOS>	54.2257880185904
<SOS> mazarin especially `` `` yes , do you know , i am very glad to hear you give that testimony ; the cardinal has some good in him , and if he were not a foreigner well , he would be more justly estimated . <EOS>	93.54528598709193
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>	102.25394598124225
<SOS> the devil take this gout ! '' <EOS>	61.36353252711131
<SOS> athos and aramis took their leave , but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke 's cries ; he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned . <EOS>	64.63118357390933
<SOS> when they reached the street , aramis said : `` well , athos , what do you think ? '' <EOS>	86.00174641502323
<SOS> `` of whom ? '' <EOS>	76.25795906044668
<SOS> `` pardieu ! <EOS>	81.63520050447988
<SOS> of monsieur de bouillon . '' <EOS>	70.54086573492013
<SOS> `` my friend , i think that he is much troubled with gout . '' <EOS>	57.64679764986304
<SOS> `` you noticed that i did n't breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit ? '' <EOS>	46.205107716826674
<SOS> `` you did well ; you would have caused him an access of his disease . <EOS>	74.15091310889261
<SOS> let us go to monsieur de beaufort . '' <EOS>	46.45755447217061
<SOS> the two friends went to the hotel de vendome . <EOS>	105.86436731840635
<SOS> it was ten o'clock when they arrived . <EOS>	59.06404140769921
<SOS> the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon , and presented as warlike an appearance . <EOS>	100.3850843184184
<SOS> there were sentinels , a guard in the court , stacks of arms , and horses saddled . <EOS>	65.34984175277656
<SOS> two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them . <EOS>	75.71396651156955
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	83.21130540327901
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	68.99514925339084
<SOS> gentlemen , '' said aramis , `` decidedly it is a night for meetings . <EOS>	98.45195273526564
<SOS> we shall be very unfortunate if , after meeting so often this evening , we should not succeed in meeting to morrow . '' <EOS>	107.4490073714924
<SOS> `` oh , as to that , sir , '' replied chatillon ( for it was he who , with flamarens , was leaving the duc de beaufort ) , `` you may be assured ; for if we meet by night without seeking each other , much more shall we meet by day when wishing it . '' <EOS>	77.65254160128572
<SOS> `` i hope that is true , '' said aramis . <EOS>	55.23280024239347
<SOS> `` as for me , i am sure of it , '' said the duke . <EOS>	73.20244913327694
<SOS> de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted . <EOS>	59.79822173178153
<SOS> hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them , and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them . <EOS>	80.21561515399219
<SOS> `` comte de la fere ! '' <EOS>	56.45624366932868
<SOS> the man cried out ; `` chevalier d'herblay ! <EOS>	60.98692811709104
<SOS> how does it happen that you are in paris ? '' <EOS>	52.8484182304694
<SOS> `` rochefort ! '' <EOS>	58.00857002736203
<SOS> cried the two friends . <EOS>	84.1517672716725
<SOS> `` yes ! <EOS>	75.28984381606783
<SOS> we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois , as you know , and we are going to give mazarin something to do . <EOS>	68.42294686158847
<SOS> you are still with us , i presume ? '' <EOS>	97.25863022347173
<SOS> `` more than ever . <EOS>	86.99949175464133
<SOS> and the duke ? '' <EOS>	61.13955774755596
<SOS> `` furious against the cardinal . <EOS>	56.98063153364757
<SOS> you know his success our dear duke ? <EOS>	86.81630927823285
<SOS> he is really king of paris ; he ca n't go out without being mobbed by his admirers . '' <EOS>	102.6563078190229
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	69.22093799840968
<SOS> so much the better ! <EOS>	104.4719088628635
<SOS> can we have the honor of seeing his highness ? '' <EOS>	65.81245029602735
<SOS> `` i shall be proud to present you , '' and rochefort walked on . <EOS>	62.036299725929
<SOS> every door was opened to him . <EOS>	61.437307864859875
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort was at supper , but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced . <EOS>	70.21448527050696
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	61.06284952722563
<SOS> he cried , `` by jove ! <EOS>	80.7517391791859
<SOS> you 're welcome , sirs . <EOS>	56.10529057673848
<SOS> you are coming to sup with me , are you not ? <EOS>	65.7797194031718
<SOS> boisgoli , tell noirmont that i have two guests . <EOS>	100.82586020841526
<SOS> you know noirmont , do you not ? <EOS>	72.6612993716331
<SOS> the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of . <EOS>	113.01119574001929
<SOS> boisgoli , let him send one of his best , but not such a one as he made for la ramee . <EOS>	53.35714722042515
<SOS> thank god ! <EOS>	54.207471396537876
<SOS> we do n't want either rope ladders or gag pears now . '' <EOS>	44.08606156488851
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said athos , `` do not let us disturb you . <EOS>	111.33912404185126
<SOS> we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders . '' <EOS>	96.1356696327977
<SOS> `` as to my health , since it has stood five years of prison , with monsieur de chavigny to boot , 't is excellent ! <EOS>	59.39519406812674
<SOS> as to my orders , since every one gives his own commands in our party , i shall end , if this goes on , by giving none at all . '' <EOS>	89.5284130965648
<SOS> `` in short , my lord , '' said athos , glancing at aramis , `` your highness is discontented with your party ? '' <EOS>	78.36622672928631
<SOS> `` discontented , sir ! <EOS>	60.98382144790307
<SOS> say my highness is furious ! <EOS>	52.44179238894789
<SOS> to such a degree , i assure you , though i would not say so to others , that if the queen , acknowledging the injuries she has done me , would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty , which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death , well ! <EOS>	68.12516620617184
<SOS> it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin ! '' <EOS>	86.32558728037
<SOS> at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile ; and had they not known it for a fact , this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there . <EOS>	101.66104854027562
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said athos , `` we are satisfied ; we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship 's service and his most faithful servants . '' <EOS>	47.04168328640766
<SOS> `` my most faithful friends , gentlemen , my most faithful friends ; you have proved it . <EOS>	71.38713233031196
<SOS> and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you , i hope , that i remain your friend , as well as that of what the devil are their names d'artagnan and porthos ? '' <EOS>	103.5511796694265
<SOS> `` d'artagnan and porthos . '' <EOS>	63.75469298431385
<SOS> `` ah , yes . <EOS>	103.08792173205178
<SOS> you understand , then , comte de la fere , you understand , chevalier d'herblay , that i am altogether and always at your service . '' <EOS>	96.68742981902274
<SOS> athos and aramis bowed and went out . <EOS>	77.30572870393088
<SOS> `` my dear athos , '' cried aramis , `` i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me ! '' <EOS>	119.14334554700703
<SOS> `` wait a little , aramis ; it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor . '' <EOS>	64.83748932187244
<SOS> `` let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace , '' said aramis . <EOS>	73.08884253775646
<SOS> they directed their horses to the city . <EOS>	116.19045940937693
<SOS> on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water , and it was again necessary to take a boat . <EOS>	95.83662081085465
<SOS> the palace rose from the bosom of the water , and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one 's self not in paris , but in venice . <EOS>	63.689496754874064
<SOS> some of these boats were dark and mysterious , others noisy and lighted up with torches . <EOS>	47.87740832476915
<SOS> the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn . <EOS>	101.76435684893694
<SOS> the palace was surrounded with water , but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls ; and the only difference was , that instead of entering by the doors , people entered by the windows . <EOS>	70.8131071570268
<SOS> thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the ante chamber , where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting . <EOS>	74.46692472980479
<SOS> `` good heavens ! '' <EOS>	93.23881823381623
<SOS> said aramis to athos , `` does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber ? '' <EOS>	70.20745561338435
<SOS> `` my dear friend , we must take people as we find them . <EOS>	116.92163600599261
<SOS> the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris , and has a court . <EOS>	97.62784530164045
<SOS> let us send in our names , and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france . <EOS>	87.33787050666139
<SOS> let us call one of these lackeys , with a demi pistole in the left hand . '' <EOS>	58.63816309909191
<SOS> `` exactly so , '' cried aramis . <EOS>	43.25817772471312
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	72.40000263755289
<SOS> if i 'm not mistaken here 's bazin . <EOS>	107.3491045312628
<SOS> come here , fellow . '' <EOS>	81.08977829210961
<SOS> bazin , who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress , turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him ; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them . <EOS>	96.966661747636
<SOS> `` a truce to compliments , '' said aramis ; `` we want to see the coadjutor , and instantly , as we are in haste . '' <EOS>	104.0712190405743
<SOS> `` certainly , sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber , only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy . '' <EOS>	60.89711799643423
<SOS> `` de bruy ! '' <EOS>	109.0039240242367
<SOS> cried the friends , `` 't is then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening , '' said aramis , `` so we give it up . '' <EOS>	69.36041430525472
<SOS> and they hastened to quit the palace , followed by bazin , who was lavish of bows and compliments . <EOS>	81.36233107394403
<SOS> `` well , '' said athos , when aramis and he were in the boat again , `` are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin ? '' <EOS>	95.37343781836267
<SOS> `` you are wisdom incarnate , athos , '' aramis replied . <EOS>	60.61686874794534
<SOS> what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england , which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe . <EOS>	67.88879200606615
<SOS> in fact , aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre , no one appeared to be aware that charles i. had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold . <EOS>	73.64970385647793
<SOS> the two friends made an appointment for ten o'clock on the following day ; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel , aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone . <EOS>	47.16751335430371
<SOS> at ten o'clock the next day they met again . <EOS>	91.39073415843956
<SOS> athos had been out since six o'clock . <EOS>	60.016376698722645
<SOS> `` well , have you any news ? '' <EOS>	74.96574709214602
<SOS> athos asked . <EOS>	71.70359862999122
<SOS> `` nothing . <EOS>	93.65199374914069
<SOS> no one has seen d'artagnan and porthos has not appeared . <EOS>	98.1960223868672
<SOS> have you anything ? '' <EOS>	48.70707685866465
<SOS> `` nothing . '' <EOS>	74.03570395326726
<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	68.15776512822823
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	113.87480776833296
<SOS> `` in fact , '' said athos , `` this delay is not natural ; they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did . '' <EOS>	89.98101340285739
<SOS> `` add to that d'artagnan 's rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour , knowing that we were expecting him . '' <EOS>	64.626762059796
<SOS> `` he expected , you will remember , to be here on the fifth . '' <EOS>	108.18141040789703
<SOS> `` and here we are at the ninth . <EOS>	86.18037112314468
<SOS> this evening the margin of possible delay expires . '' <EOS>	85.12553488793726
<SOS> `` what do you think should be done , '' asked athos , `` if we have no news of them to night ? '' <EOS>	76.59777613424393
<SOS> `` pardieu ! <EOS>	66.55694756082093
<SOS> we must go and look for them . '' <EOS>	68.91350969650819
<SOS> `` all right , '' said athos . <EOS>	77.2145792583731
<SOS> `` but raoul ? '' <EOS>	51.196208248650734
<SOS> said aramis . <EOS>	49.24302355755436
<SOS> a light cloud passed over the count 's face . <EOS>	53.673799525791416
<SOS> `` raoul gives me much uneasiness , '' he said . <EOS>	61.02142461062767
<SOS> `` he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé ; he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned . '' <EOS>	61.693894742833564
<SOS> `` have you seen madame de chevreuse ? '' <EOS>	94.889435000865
<SOS> `` she was not at home . <EOS>	48.418679430187545
<SOS> and you , aramis , you were going , i think , to visit madame de longueville . '' <EOS>	67.40097622225353
<SOS> `` i did go there . '' <EOS>	76.48213692714783
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	110.38228253443522
<SOS> `` she was no longer there , but she had left her new address . '' <EOS>	44.7100590840804
<SOS> `` where was she ? '' <EOS>	72.96174914290265
<SOS> `` guess ; i give you a thousand chances . '' <EOS>	76.20465958726278
<SOS> `` how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight ? <EOS>	42.254194738423514
<SOS> for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her . '' <EOS>	83.58001679407398
<SOS> `` at the hotel de ville , my dear fellow . '' <EOS>	75.37389368724634
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	58.860654441333494
<SOS> at the hotel de ville ? <EOS>	52.52439020891318
<SOS> has she , then , been appointed provost of merchants ? '' <EOS>	59.43900968049733
<SOS> `` no ; but she has become queen of paris , ad interim , and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries , she is installed at the hotel de ville , where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke . '' <EOS>	95.53970814265521
<SOS> `` you did n't tell me of that , aramis . '' <EOS>	73.4306708057738
<SOS> `` really ? <EOS>	53.79966322833229
<SOS> it was my forgetfulness then ; pardon me . '' <EOS>	68.9411203028847
<SOS> `` now , '' asked athos , `` what are we to do with ourselves till evening ? <EOS>	89.44415241306386
<SOS> here we are without occupation , it seems to me . '' <EOS>	68.70974399028947
<SOS> `` you forget , my friend , that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton ; i hope to see monsieur de chatillon , whom i 've hated for a long time , there . '' <EOS>	48.04240685390648
<SOS> `` why have you hated him ? '' <EOS>	59.2427400045917
<SOS> `` because he is the brother of coligny . '' <EOS>	78.51077076563196
<SOS> `` ah , true ! <EOS>	76.42407706559821
<SOS> he who presumed to be a rival of yours , for which he was severely punished ; that ought to satisfy you . '' <EOS>	65.02015461992869
<SOS> `` 'yes , but it does not ; i am rancorous the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman . <EOS>	61.2517171340948

<SOS> `` in that case , my dear friend , if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose ; the drum beats ; i observed cannon on the road ; i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville ; certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton , as the duc de chatillon said . '' <EOS>	82.22400137294461
<SOS> `` i supposed , '' said athos , `` that last night 's conferences would modify those warlike arrangements . '' <EOS>	91.93361945642185
<SOS> `` no doubt ; but they will fight , none the less , if only to mask the conferences . '' <EOS>	52.10541840659706
<SOS> `` poor creatures ! '' <EOS>	64.60409567931492
<SOS> said athos , `` who are going to be killed , in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him , that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort , and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal . '' <EOS>	74.83313822388578
<SOS> `` come , come , dear athos , confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair . '' <EOS>	41.2254995720565

<SOS> planchet , prouder than ever of his new duties , deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men , forming the rear of the army of paris , and to march on charenton when necessary . <EOS>	76.56112937165946
<SOS> `` this day will be a warm one , '' said planchet , in a warlike tone . <EOS>	65.84030122981243
<SOS> `` no doubt , '' said aramis , `` but it is far from here to the enemy . '' <EOS>	50.417921700019065
<SOS> `` sir , the distance will be diminished , '' said a subordinate . <EOS>	54.926700727077574
<SOS> aramis saluted , then turning toward athos : `` i do n't care to camp on the place royale with all these people , '' he said . <EOS>	73.7179070655626
<SOS> `` shall we go forward ? <EOS>	80.70968349869564
<SOS> we shall see better what is going on . '' <EOS>	66.76938775089599
<SOS> `` and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you . <EOS>	57.03837288185445
<SOS> come , then , my friend , we will go forward . '' <EOS>	56.276747342958416
<SOS> `` have n't you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account ? '' <EOS>	61.80840753705493
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said athos , `` i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary . '' <EOS>	99.01569475913784
<SOS> `` and how long ago was that ? '' <EOS>	77.8284810187312

<SOS> another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt . <EOS>	71.1058864856658
<SOS> well , my friend , nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow . '' <EOS>	86.31323907295334
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	64.43747863272942
<SOS> said athos , putting a finger on his lips , with the sad smile peculiar to him ; `` let us talk no more of mordaunt it will bring bad luck . '' <EOS>	99.5249382151859
<SOS> and athos set forward toward charenton , followed closely by aramis . <EOS>	69.79624939328434
<SOS> chapter lxxviii . <EOS>	111.70356347195626
<SOS> the battle of charenton . <EOS>	80.67178911567373
<SOS> as athos and aramis proceeded , and passed different companies on the road , they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle . <EOS>	59.92307280892158
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	84.88807370037057
<SOS> my friend ! '' <EOS>	70.92824848793259
<SOS> cried athos , suddenly , `` where have you brought us ? <EOS>	84.00253351224876
<SOS> i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army ; is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers ? '' <EOS>	70.74512712150992
<SOS> `` good day , sirs , '' said the duke , advancing ; `` you are puzzled by what you see here , but one word will explain everything . <EOS>	72.86322159939222
<SOS> there is now a truce and a conference . <EOS>	51.092638906695335
<SOS> the prince , monsieur de retz , the duc de beaufort , the duc de bouillon , are talking over public affairs . <EOS>	54.58494831877625
<SOS> now one of two things must happen : either matters will not be arranged , or they will be arranged , in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again . '' <EOS>	88.21585380436723
<SOS> `` sir , '' said aramis , `` you speak to the point . <EOS>	111.94130511536567
<SOS> allow me to ask you a question : where are the plenipotentiaries ? '' <EOS>	57.41448302733723
<SOS> `` at charenton , in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris . '' <EOS>	99.62930632806565
<SOS> `` and was this conference arranged beforehand ? '' <EOS>	74.8743410558124
<SOS> `` no , gentlemen , it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians . '' <EOS>	68.24530059760649
<SOS> athos and aramis exchanged smiles ; for they well knew what those propositions were , to whom they had been made and who had made them . <EOS>	67.10710992035216
<SOS> `` and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are , '' asked athos , `` belongs to `` `` to monsieur de chanleu , who commands your troops at charenton . <EOS>	77.74714376101906
<SOS> i say your troops , for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs ? '' <EOS>	49.94708155082977
<SOS> `` yes , almost , '' said aramis . <EOS>	61.90868944922864
<SOS> `` we are for the king and the princes , '' added athos . <EOS>	67.29506297622478
<SOS> `` we must understand each other , '' said the duke . <EOS>	66.172828167381
<SOS> `` the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé , although i must add 't is almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs . '' <EOS>	83.29717979700555
<SOS> `` yes , '' answered athos , `` but his right place is in our ranks , with the prince de conti , de beaufort , d'elbeuf , and de bouillon ; but , sir , supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take charenton ? '' <EOS>	115.05057793280052
<SOS> `` such are my orders . '' <EOS>	98.40306252931828
<SOS> `` sir , since you command the cavalry `` `` pardon me , i am commander in chief . '' <EOS>	65.92453039776015
<SOS> `` so much the better . <EOS>	91.6507803279299
<SOS> you must know all your officers i mean those more distinguished . '' <EOS>	77.23991375295944
<SOS> `` why , yes , very nearly . '' <EOS>	64.3110037260156
<SOS> `` will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the chevalier d'artagnan , lieutenant in the musketeers ? '' <EOS>	73.74525475676587
<SOS> `` no , sir , he is not with us ; he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to england . '' <EOS>	66.88647793389156
<SOS> `` i knew that , but i supposed he had returned . '' <EOS>	71.79406742145306
<SOS> `` no , sir ; no one has seen him . <EOS>	74.33482902824711
<SOS> i can answer positively on that point , for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon , the substitute for monsieur d'artagnan , still holds his place . '' <EOS>	98.07697386899154
<SOS> the two friends looked at each other . <EOS>	82.82969208605293
<SOS> `` you see , '' said athos . <EOS>	70.43463449995207
<SOS> `` it is strange , '' said aramis . <EOS>	84.94424008283129
<SOS> `` it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way . '' <EOS>	91.22589269296469
<SOS> `` if we have no news of them this evening , to morrow we must start . '' <EOS>	96.20551276050251
<SOS> athos nodded affirmatively , then turning : `` and monsieur de bragelonne , a young man fifteen years of age , attached to the prince de condé has he the honor of being known to you ? '' <EOS>	49.56343039276134
<SOS> diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings . <EOS>	41.38986840674691
<SOS> `` yes , surely , he came with the prince ; a charming young man ; he is one of your friends then , monsieur le comte ? '' <EOS>	56.9650233289431
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' answered athos , agitated ; `` so much so that i wish to see him if possible . '' <EOS>	56.89104948113555
<SOS> `` quite possible , sir ; do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters . '' <EOS>	74.04095994229708
<SOS> `` halloo , there ! '' <EOS>	78.15316148696671
<SOS> cried aramis , turning around ; `` what a noise behind us ! '' <EOS>	87.42963291252987
<SOS> `` a body of cavaliers is coming toward us , '' said chatillon . <EOS>	65.01230618141612
<SOS> `` i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat . '' <EOS>	85.57022808218382
<SOS> `` and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers . '' <EOS>	54.77134001200103
<SOS> `` they are coming , full gallop ; the prince is with them ah ! <EOS>	83.72715151642466
<SOS> he is leaving them ! '' <EOS>	83.39778862096827
<SOS> `` they are beating the rappel ! '' <EOS>	59.37765888937225
<SOS> cried chatillon ; `` we must discover what is going on . '' <EOS>	59.65417689269883
<SOS> in fact , they saw the soldiers running to their arms ; the trumpets sounded ; the drums beat ; the duc de beaufort drew his sword . <EOS>	90.25315112807023
<SOS> on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army , mingling momentarily with the parisian troops , ran to him . <EOS>	63.32456347205901
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' cried chatillon , `` the truce is broken , that is evident ; they are going to fight ; go , then , into charenton , for i shall begin in a short time there 's a signal from the prince ! '' <EOS>	99.64695804894367
<SOS> the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince . <EOS>	60.02990273585652
<SOS> `` farewell , till the next time we meet , '' cried chatillon , and he set off , full gallop . <EOS>	82.50439173595481
<SOS> athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort . <EOS>	64.95865423993926
<SOS> as to the duc de bouillon , he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter ; but his place was well filled by the duc d'elbeuf and his four sons , ranged around him like a staff . <EOS>	95.09740660744025
<SOS> meantime , between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead . <EOS>	68.51160110039899
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' cried the coadjutor , tightening his sash , which he wore , after the fashion of the ancient military prelates , over his archiepiscopal simar , `` there 's the enemy approaching . <EOS>	44.440989609898644
<SOS> let us save them half of their journey . '' <EOS>	66.87747752481623
<SOS> and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off ; his regiment , which bore the name of the regiment of corinth , from the name of his archbishopric , darted after him and began the fight . <EOS>	102.39424796604062
<SOS> monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry , toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu , who defended the place , was ready to resist an assault , or if the enemy were repulsed , to attempt a sortie . <EOS>	104.96596944986432
<SOS> the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor . <EOS>	60.80670711671129
<SOS> his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard , no matter for whom or against whom . <EOS>	104.00257127337555
<SOS> chanleu , whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment , thought that the moment was come to pursue it ; but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person . <EOS>	83.86175056066033
<SOS> this charge was so fierce , so skillfully conducted , that chanleu was almost surrounded . <EOS>	88.40342471216519
<SOS> he commanded a retreat , which began , step by step , foot by foot ; unhappily , in an instant he fell , mortally wounded . <EOS>	88.34611391847203
<SOS> de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men , which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies , so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches , where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment . <EOS>	68.70932451707023
<SOS> suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops , who were entering , pele mele , the intrenchments with the fugitives . <EOS>	93.83723885065793
<SOS> athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons ; aramis with sword and pistol in his hands , athos with his sword in his scabbard , his pistol in his saddle bags ; calm and cool as if on the parade , except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes . <EOS>	69.24677921355783
<SOS> aramis , on the contrary , struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement . <EOS>	104.74904338159679
<SOS> his bright eyes kindled , and his mouth , so finely formed , assumed a wicked smile ; every blow he aimed was sure , and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again . <EOS>	107.57367691790822
<SOS> on the opposite side two cavaliers , one covered with a gilt cuirass , the other wearing simply a buff doublet , from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet , charged in front . <EOS>	77.43963883478473
<SOS> the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill . <EOS>	89.3322589913026
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	91.36551630441681
<SOS> 't is you , monsieur de chatillon , '' cried the chevalier ; `` welcome to you i expected you . '' <EOS>	56.70613695166995
<SOS> `` i hope i have not made you wait too long , sir , '' said the duke ; `` at all events , here i am . '' <EOS>	67.33463241565308
<SOS> `` monsieur de chatillon , '' cried aramis , taking from his saddle bags a second pistol , `` i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man . '' <EOS>	73.39038213817678
<SOS> `` thank god , sir , they are not ! '' <EOS>	92.90887159941046
<SOS> and the duke , pointing his pistol at aramis , fired . <EOS>	69.76315020760222
<SOS> but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke 's finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him . <EOS>	104.9117475429806
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	101.14336611435279
<SOS> you 've missed me , '' cried aramis , `` but i swear to heaven ! <EOS>	91.24427810392062
<SOS> i will not miss you . '' <EOS>	49.09188788524148
<SOS> `` if i give you time ! '' <EOS>	74.96753662301798
<SOS> cried the duke , spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword . <EOS>	47.35691478690859
<SOS> aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions , and athos , who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning , was just going to cry out , `` fire ! <EOS>	85.77445353480536
<SOS> fire , then ! '' <EOS>	69.84590489688836
<SOS> when the shot was fired . <EOS>	54.55041224050147
<SOS> de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse . <EOS>	65.96327568713728
<SOS> the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass . <EOS>	58.70793587496649
<SOS> `` i am a dead man , '' he said , and fell from his horse to the ground . <EOS>	81.67341785623319
<SOS> `` i told you this , i am now grieved i have kept my word . <EOS>	96.94270064749773
<SOS> can i be of any use to you ? '' <EOS>	44.96924428461483
<SOS> chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock ; 't was a thrust from a sword , but his cuirass turned aside the blow . <EOS>	56.57464914936334
<SOS> he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist , when he started back , exclaiming , `` raoul ! '' <EOS>	117.77715749311427
<SOS> `` raoul ? '' <EOS>	72.25375332664039
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	72.21134100220785
<SOS> the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d'herblay ; two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul , but aramis protected him with his sword . <EOS>	69.75787031425348
<SOS> `` my prisoner ! '' <EOS>	60.57907026906493
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	75.29193188696921
<SOS> athos took his son 's horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee . <EOS>	78.20967946387886
<SOS> at this crisis of the battle , the prince , who had been seconding de chatillon in the second line , appeared in the midst of the fight ; his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero . <EOS>	95.80891076803539
<SOS> on seeing him , the regiment of corinth , which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts , threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces , put them into confusion and re entered charenton flying . <EOS>	65.55695572331913
<SOS> the coadjutor , dragged along with his fugitive forces , passed near the group formed by athos , raoul and aramis . <EOS>	100.75514551512619
<SOS> aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor 's misfortune , and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct , when athos stopped him . <EOS>	77.2251029962447
<SOS> `` on , on ! '' <EOS>	102.48641996180106
<SOS> he cried , `` this is no moment for compliments ; or rather , back , for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs . '' <EOS>	61.61619010925843
<SOS> `` it is a matter of indifference to me , '' said aramis ; `` i came here only to meet de chatillon ; i have met him , i am contented ; 't is something to have met de chatillon in a duel ! '' <EOS>	79.54374158799114
<SOS> `` and besides , we have a prisoner , '' said athos , pointing to raoul . <EOS>	55.01462353193172
<SOS> the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop . <EOS>	77.6463692966413
<SOS> `` what were you doing in the battle , my friend ? '' <EOS>	47.94231524255459
<SOS> inquired athos of the youth ; `` 't was not your right place , i think , as you were not equipped for an engagement ! '' <EOS>	59.485223469220806
<SOS> `` i had no intention of fighting to day , sir ; i was charged , indeed , with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil , when , seeing monsieur de chatillon charge , an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side . <EOS>	87.13578323540267
<SOS> it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere . '' <EOS>	47.15540862092488
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	93.2638622262053
<SOS> you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier ? '' <EOS>	56.61866401434023
<SOS> `` i did not recognize the chevalier in armor , sir ! '' <EOS>	99.67480015573221
<SOS> said raoul , blushing ; `` though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger . '' <EOS>	79.81718015130338
<SOS> `` thank you for the compliment , my young friend , '' replied aramis , `` we can see from whom you learned courtesy . <EOS>	73.71139488563979
<SOS> then you were going to rueil ? '' <EOS>	59.49047999444096
<SOS> `` yes ! <EOS>	95.1102892599629
<SOS> i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence . '' <EOS>	58.601790424920324
<SOS> `` you must still deliver it , '' said athos . <EOS>	64.73335625767571
<SOS> `` no false generosity , count ! <EOS>	90.72628164795464
<SOS> the fate of our friends , to say nothing of our own , is perhaps in that very despatch . '' <EOS>	70.17286841660446
<SOS> `` this young man must not , however , fail in his duty , '' said athos . <EOS>	83.29875714130912
<SOS> `` in the first place , count , this youth is our prisoner ; you seem to forget that . <EOS>	87.17864043242356
<SOS> what i propose to do is fair in war ; the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means . <EOS>	109.26263882072683
<SOS> give me the despatch , raoul . '' <EOS>	97.65177893072527
<SOS> the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct . <EOS>	58.674726535564155
<SOS> `` give him the despatch , raoul ! <EOS>	62.618447077026836
<SOS> you are the chevalier 's prisoner . '' <EOS>	93.37797600383935
<SOS> raoul gave it up reluctantly ; aramis instantly seized and read it . <EOS>	82.58350853071799
<SOS> `` you , '' he said , `` you , who are so trusting , read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see . '' <EOS>	90.71437080221317
<SOS> athos took the letter , frowning , but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d'artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it . <EOS>	50.00399212487176
<SOS> `` my lord , i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges , the ten men you demand . <EOS>	77.98925371323928
<SOS> they are good soldiers , fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of . '' <EOS>	54.26566735462443
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	86.12375658970215
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	96.39063068258594
<SOS> `` well , '' said aramis , `` what think you about these two enemies whom it requires , besides comminges 's troop , ten good soldiers to confront ; are they not as like as two drops of water to d'artagnan and porthos ? '' <EOS>	101.68521195147193
<SOS> `` we 'll search paris all day long , '' said athos , `` and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy ; and i feel no doubt that , thanks to d'artagnan 's ready invention , we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts . '' <EOS>	53.678539679692456
<SOS> `` yes , let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master . '' <EOS>	83.09181979562086
<SOS> `` that poor planchet ! <EOS>	74.37131458175726
<SOS> you speak of him very much at your ease , aramis ; he has probably been killed . <EOS>	70.62531357091673
<SOS> all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred . '' <EOS>	75.02208750017444
<SOS> it was , then , with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet , who alone could give them information , was alive or dead , that the friends returned to the place royale ; to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there , drinking and bantering each other , although , doubtless , mourned by their families , who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting . <EOS>	91.67658861087467
<SOS> athos and aramis again questioned planchet , but he had seen nothing of d'artagnan ; they wished to take planchet with them , but he could not leave his troop , who at five o'clock returned home , saying that they were returning from the battle , whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii . <EOS>	59.02982752979929

<SOS> the road to picardy . <EOS>	62.85514385270234
<SOS> on leaving paris , athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger ; but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger . <EOS>	88.65079274219023
<SOS> besides , they felt that the dénouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make . <EOS>	86.24419345022581
<SOS> besides , there was no tranquillity in paris itself . <EOS>	55.83706300252125
<SOS> provisions began to fail , and whenever one of the prince de conti 's generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult , which he put down again , and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues . <EOS>	68.21011965324229
<SOS> in one of these risings , the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin , in order to give the populace , as he put it , something to gnaw at . <EOS>	85.38957096986542
<SOS> athos and aramis left paris after this coup d'etat , which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton . <EOS>	87.6382672415825
<SOS> they quitted paris , beholding it abandoned to extreme want , bordering on famine ; agitated by fear , torn by faction . <EOS>	72.29310315461574
<SOS> parisians and frondeurs as they were , the two friends expected to find the same misery , the same fears , the same intrigue in the enemy 's camp ; but what was their surprise , after passing saint denis , to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing , and leading generally cheerful lives . <EOS>	58.938516437386
<SOS> the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france , and also to escape the frondeurs , who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville , in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes . <EOS>	91.60349522488563
<SOS> having escaped these dangers , they returned by the main road to boulogne , at abbeville , and followed it step by step , examining every track . <EOS>	67.41084225299758
<SOS> nevertheless , they were still in a state of uncertainty . <EOS>	107.74599103010098
<SOS> several inns were visited by them , several innkeepers questioned , without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries , when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers . <EOS>	102.26504369161185
<SOS> he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife : `` port .... d'art .... < num > d february . '' <EOS>	116.3289484514369
<SOS> `` this is capital ! '' <EOS>	52.705222601405
<SOS> said athos to aramis , `` we were to have slept here , but we can not we must push on . '' <EOS>	93.81283513055206
<SOS> they rode forward and reached abbeville . <EOS>	44.048728965502825
<SOS> there the great number of inns puzzled them ; they could not go to all ; how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed ? <EOS>	93.67242404132521
<SOS> `` trust me , '' said aramis , `` do not expect to find anything in abbeville . <EOS>	58.579452740954466
<SOS> if we had only been looking for porthos , porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him . <EOS>	99.05578701114909
<SOS> but d'artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses . <EOS>	62.60516033634184
<SOS> porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger ; he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else . '' <EOS>	53.03144833442635
<SOS> they continued their route . <EOS>	94.68640060541229
<SOS> it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task , and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor , friendship and gratitude , implanted in their hearts , our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand , their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces . <EOS>	67.458902916539
<SOS> they proceeded thus to peronne . <EOS>	81.39817096049677
<SOS> athos began to despair . <EOS>	58.003715947869544
<SOS> his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them . <EOS>	75.24734989443814
<SOS> they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends . <EOS>	75.78269270472305
<SOS> they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries . <EOS>	70.93307280718413
<SOS> they were willing and ready to retrace their steps , when , in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town , upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart , athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk , which represented , with the awkwardness of a first attempt , two cavaliers riding furiously ; one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words : `` they are following us . '' <EOS>	44.19552624177371
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	69.87699775357096
<SOS> exclaimed athos , `` here it is , as clear as day ; pursued as he was , d'artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely , which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping . '' <EOS>	63.83959837497553
<SOS> aramis shook his head . <EOS>	87.50511414903491
<SOS> `` had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of . '' <EOS>	89.87622694703711
<SOS> `` you are right , aramis , let us travel on . '' <EOS>	104.47190642495528
<SOS> to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible . <EOS>	57.696227575582604
<SOS> uneasiness took possession of the tender , constant heart of athos , and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis . <EOS>	86.70012983621626
<SOS> they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall . <EOS>	104.26397825181616
<SOS> all at once , in a narrow pass , they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone . <EOS>	75.9260277957815
<SOS> it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength . <EOS>	75.60151887451865
<SOS> aramis stopped . <EOS>	68.20561454338714
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	76.1025277010275
<SOS> he said , looking at the stone , `` this is the work of either hercules or porthos . <EOS>	47.7120238997617
<SOS> let us get down , count , and examine this rock . '' <EOS>	61.64583185587394
<SOS> they both alighted . <EOS>	74.23533432118299
<SOS> the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road , but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside . <EOS>	68.88561655373931
<SOS> with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over . <EOS>	79.90000641329988
<SOS> upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words : `` eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us . <EOS>	94.2468329015011
<SOS> if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock . <EOS>	103.67800461231322
<SOS> it is kept by a friend of ours . '' <EOS>	70.7802237253955
<SOS> `` at last we have something definite , '' said athos ; `` let us go to the peacock . '' <EOS>	66.27986925460638
<SOS> `` yes , '' answered aramis , `` but if we are to get there we must rest our horses , for they are almost broken winded . '' <EOS>	57.45121289352245
<SOS> aramis was right ; they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine ; they gave them three hours ' rest and then set off again . <EOS>	65.56726665744088
<SOS> the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue , but hope supported them . <EOS>	96.62096985885987
<SOS> in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock . <EOS>	68.90122111152725
<SOS> the host proved to be a worthy man , as bald as a chinaman . <EOS>	76.21601872827642
<SOS> they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons ; without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier . <EOS>	92.0375292614502
<SOS> `` do you know that ? '' <EOS>	62.80380689603384
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	58.01193780308141
<SOS> athos merely glanced at it . <EOS>	67.3250930588717
<SOS> `` 't is d'artagnan 's sword , '' he said . <EOS>	54.82702877078387
<SOS> `` does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two ? '' <EOS>	44.01097928075354
<SOS> asked the host . <EOS>	116.79561740208013
<SOS> `` to the smaller . '' <EOS>	77.57424570817838
<SOS> `` i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen . '' <EOS>	96.49227669695614
<SOS> `` well , what has happened to them ? '' <EOS>	93.7592166516316
<SOS> `` they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons , who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate . '' <EOS>	94.21598975887093
<SOS> `` eight ! '' <EOS>	100.64009092719606
<SOS> said aramis ; `` it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d'artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men . '' <EOS>	86.02078999770963
<SOS> `` the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king 's service , who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers . '' <EOS>	54.80152790439678
<SOS> `` arrested , were they ? '' <EOS>	66.25089959928404
<SOS> inquired athos ; `` is it known why ? '' <EOS>	87.55363880776076
<SOS> `` no , sir , they were carried off instantly , and had not even time to tell me why ; but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade , as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones . '' <EOS>	89.3420431504113
<SOS> `` 't is still a consolation that they were not wounded , '' said aramis . <EOS>	64.6043545228042
<SOS> `` where were they taken ? '' <EOS>	64.52785285625555
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	63.82584172978996
<SOS> `` toward the town of louvres , '' was the reply . <EOS>	70.33354314692151
<SOS> the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses , resolved to take post horses ; and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres . <EOS>	68.18375301401878
<SOS> here they found only one inn , in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town . <EOS>	69.60876902265291
<SOS> `` let us alight here , '' said athos . <EOS>	65.63978366127932
<SOS> `` d'artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur , and at the same time leaving some trace of himself . '' <EOS>	80.23842444661436
<SOS> they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur , at the counter as their friends must have done before them . <EOS>	54.3703257485436
<SOS> the counter was covered with a plate of pewter ; upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin : `` rueil ... d .. '' `` they went to rueil , '' cried aramis . <EOS>	69.72301543565499
<SOS> `` let us go to rueil , '' said athos . <EOS>	47.82455265743746
<SOS> `` it is to throw ourselves into the wolf 's jaws , '' said aramis . <EOS>	76.82085657819154
<SOS> `` had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d'artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself ; and you would have done the same , aramis . '' <EOS>	111.5980155279713
<SOS> `` certainly but you make me out better than i am , dear count . <EOS>	74.1840378189048
<SOS> had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution . <EOS>	48.833297838440615
<SOS> but where you go , i go . '' <EOS>	109.36560665022246
<SOS> they then set off for rueil . <EOS>	88.65381258825974
<SOS> here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived , in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks , and produced eventually that shameful peace , at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested . <EOS>	80.3601744443127
<SOS> rueil was crowded with advocates , presidents and councillors , who came from the parisians , and , on the side of the court , with officers and guards ; it was therefore easy , in the midst of this confusion , to remain as unobserved as any one might wish ; besides , the conferences implied a truce , and to arrest two gentlemen , even frondeurs , at this time , would have been an attack on the rights of the people . <EOS>	74.40167594366001
<SOS> the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them . <EOS>	76.64331417142805
<SOS> they expected to hear some mention made of d'artagnan or of porthos , but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms . <EOS>	66.2545524259527
<SOS> it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister . <EOS>	80.14519952866344
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said aramis , `` take care ; our safety lies in our obscurity . <EOS>	88.17507960027342
<SOS> if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch , from which the devil himself could not take us out . <EOS>	103.8143578046033
<SOS> let us try not to find them out by accident , but from our notions . <EOS>	118.67127051581525
<SOS> arrested at compiegne , they have been carried to rueil ; at rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal , who has either kept them near him or sent them to saint germain . <EOS>	92.62966943739613
<SOS> as to the bastile , they are not there , though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs . <EOS>	62.337782755662715
<SOS> they are not dead , for the death of d'artagnan would make a sensation . <EOS>	62.097232028618954
<SOS> as for porthos , i believe him to be eternal , like god , although less patient . <EOS>	56.58304433327879
<SOS> do not let us despond , but wait at rueil , for my conviction is that they are at rueil . <EOS>	82.4298774680057
<SOS> but what ails you ? <EOS>	64.67029799221466
<SOS> you are pale . '' <EOS>	55.31978138096381
<SOS> `` it is this , '' answered athos , with a trembling voice . <EOS>	71.44707131286665
<SOS> `` i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible 'oubliettes ' constructed . '' <EOS>	57.909536740012975
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	46.19299284692498
<SOS> never fear , '' said aramis . <EOS>	54.11869503019362
<SOS> `` richelieu was a gentleman , our equal in birth , our superior in position . <EOS>	112.32959637405044
<SOS> he could , like the king , touch the greatest of us on the head , and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders . <EOS>	77.73191599691073
<SOS> but mazarin is a low born rogue , who can at the most take us by the collar , like an archer . <EOS>	97.9199973629064
<SOS> be calm for i am sure that d'artagnan and porthos are at rueil , alive and well . '' <EOS>	106.70668214931025
<SOS> `` but , '' resumed athos , `` i recur to my first proposal . <EOS>	84.39668669419063
<SOS> i know no better means than to act with candor . <EOS>	79.85126441280232
<SOS> i shall seek , not mazarin , but the queen , and say to her , 'madame , restore to us your two servants and our two friends . ' '' <EOS>	79.45996918498676
<SOS> aramis shook his head . <EOS>	63.4606232457722
<SOS> `` 't is a last resource , but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for ; let us rather persevere in our researches . '' <EOS>	83.99939903491145
<SOS> they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d'artagnan to rueil . <EOS>	90.5393823498906
<SOS> athos , however , perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen . <EOS>	70.28071447422025
<SOS> `` in order to see the queen , '' said aramis , `` we must first see the cardinal ; and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you , athos we shall be reunited to our friends , but not in the way you wish . <EOS>	94.08817343083201
<SOS> now , that way of joining them is not very attractive to me , i confess . <EOS>	72.813985101237
<SOS> let us act in freedom , that we may act well and quickly . '' <EOS>	77.91228728089648
<SOS> `` i shall go , '' he said , `` to the queen . '' <EOS>	66.16958052284274
<SOS> `` well , then , '' answered aramis , `` pray tell me a day or two beforehand , that i may take that opportunity of going to paris . '' <EOS>	54.477676351217106
<SOS> `` to whom ? '' <EOS>	97.76474117246804
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	96.71864418894
<SOS> how do i know ? <EOS>	102.98945661204422
<SOS> perhaps to madame de longueville . <EOS>	54.17270711211918
<SOS> she is all powerful yonder ; she will help me . <EOS>	56.72616999545359
<SOS> but send me word should you be arrested , for then i will return directly . '' <EOS>	69.41370595535923
<SOS> `` why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me ? '' <EOS>	68.99470855828764
<SOS> `` no , i thank you . '' <EOS>	56.218082283337495
<SOS> `` should we , by being arrested , be all four together again , we should not , i am not sure , be twenty four hours in prison without getting free . '' <EOS>	66.30524975809455
<SOS> `` my friend , since i killed chatillon , adored of the ladies of saint germain , i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly . <EOS>	51.64158389760352
<SOS> the queen is likely to follow mazarin 's counsels and to have me tried . '' <EOS>	60.72809486962847
<SOS> `` do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does ? '' <EOS>	78.38483324709459
<SOS> `` did she not love an englishman ? '' <EOS>	76.55202948110583
<SOS> `` my friend , she is a woman . '' <EOS>	43.77307139914108
<SOS> `` no , no , you are deceived she is a queen . '' <EOS>	51.4709773010714
<SOS> `` dear friend , i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria . '' <EOS>	117.30868923338303
<SOS> `` adieu , athos , i am going to raise an army . '' <EOS>	50.409904092809896
<SOS> `` for what purpose ? '' <EOS>	54.16279255344855
<SOS> `` to come back and besiege rueil . '' <EOS>	75.59849282658489
<SOS> `` where shall we meet again ? '' <EOS>	81.20533192846321
<SOS> `` at the foot of the cardinal 's gallows . '' <EOS>	61.104430950871496
<SOS> the two friends departed aramis to return to paris , athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen . <EOS>	60.29264330564222
<SOS> chapter lxxx . <EOS>	60.16906284174342
<SOS> the gratitude of anne of austria . <EOS>	54.604784377816245
<SOS> athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria . <EOS>	106.46007673031542
<SOS> it was granted , and was to take place after her morning 's `` levee , '' at which , in accordance with his rights of birth , he was entitled to be present . <EOS>	60.860116666614914
<SOS> a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain . <EOS>	101.03584432953889
<SOS> anne had never at the louvre had so large a court ; but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility , while the prince de conti , the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france . <EOS>	66.81756941836521
<SOS> the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court . <EOS>	105.76585740656762
<SOS> the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance . <EOS>	100.59988056686508
<SOS> the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court ; and the casualties , though not mortal , were painful , as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule . <EOS>	60.742881311597
<SOS> in the midst of this seeming hilarity , nevertheless , people 's minds were uneasy . <EOS>	101.1686855705786
<SOS> was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen ? <EOS>	64.26311894569648
<SOS> was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there ? <EOS>	122.61905267510271
<SOS> every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers , lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest . <EOS>	44.134489400723176
<SOS> he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do . <EOS>	55.1207928127432
<SOS> condé himself , whilst fighting for him , lost no opportunity of ridiculing , of humbling him . <EOS>	66.40449320369119
<SOS> the queen , on whom he threw himself as sole support , seemed to him now not much to be relied upon . <EOS>	64.60759885233219
<SOS> when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen , who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris , had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them . <EOS>	75.0079169538929
<SOS> all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day ; athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms , lost in that raging whirlwind . <EOS>	68.64732709957681
<SOS> but athos was a man of inflexible determination ; he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed , when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty . <EOS>	74.3328369950073
<SOS> he insisted on being introduced , saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti , or monsieur de beaufort , or monsieur de bouillon , or monsieur d'elbeuf , or the coadjutor , or madame de longueville , or broussel , or the parliament , and although he had come on his own private account , he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance . <EOS>	112.37384612998838
<SOS> the conference being finished , the queen summoned him to her cabinet . <EOS>	52.66623554104035
<SOS> athos was introduced and announced by name . <EOS>	64.30270728230103
<SOS> it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty 's ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it ; yet she remained impassive , looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens , either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth . <EOS>	42.87482356850659
<SOS> `` it is then a service which you propose to render us , count ? '' <EOS>	88.98848008400971
<SOS> asked anne of austria , after a moment 's silence . <EOS>	88.72886988047907
<SOS> `` yes , madame , another service , '' said athos , shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him . <EOS>	90.39970995264112
<SOS> athos had a noble heart , and made , therefore , but a poor courtier . <EOS>	86.6760747288106
<SOS> anne frowned . <EOS>	62.00104827906983
<SOS> mazarin , who was sitting at a table folding up papers , as if he had only been a secretary of state , looked up . <EOS>	47.3882045435453
<SOS> `` speak , '' said the queen . <EOS>	84.77148800594563
<SOS> mazarin turned again to his papers . <EOS>	58.70471331680718
<SOS> `` madame , '' resumed athos , `` two of my friends , named d'artagnan and monsieur du vallon , sent to england by the cardinal , suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france ; no one knows what has become of them . '' <EOS>	89.26837020592623
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	63.941695610933245
<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	65.50332695306787
<SOS> `` i address myself , therefore , first to the benevolence of your majesty , that i may know what has become of my friends , reserving to myself , if necessary , the right of appealing hereafter to your justice . '' <EOS>	72.26805166826071
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied anne , with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence , `` this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns ! <EOS>	92.38556986800387
<SOS> an affair for the police ! <EOS>	99.08100444137388
<SOS> well , sir , you ought to know that we no longer have a police , since we are no longer at paris . '' <EOS>	87.71418743138837
<SOS> `` i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are , but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections . '' <EOS>	43.85844045389154
<SOS> `` but , god forgive me ! '' <EOS>	86.23974399373218
<SOS> cried anne , with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her , `` i believe that you are yourself interrogating . '' <EOS>	99.46702523240118
<SOS> `` yes , madame , here i have a right to do so , for it concerns monsieur d'artagnan d'artagnan , '' he repeated , in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman . <EOS>	59.75577526300295
<SOS> the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne . <EOS>	59.29838456930987
<SOS> `` sir , '' he said , `` i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty . <EOS>	46.19455789422547
<SOS> these individuals are under arrest . <EOS>	122.51634417349393
<SOS> they disobeyed orders . '' <EOS>	98.35752098443403
<SOS> `` i beg of your majesty , then , '' said athos , calmly and not replying to mazarin , `` to quash these arrests of messieurs d'artagnan and du vallon . '' <EOS>	85.78077879575255
<SOS> `` what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me , '' said the queen . <EOS>	75.55330889054403
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned , '' said athos , bowing with great dignity . <EOS>	73.33682817123308
<SOS> he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him . <EOS>	85.57922887027736
<SOS> `` you , too , have been in england , sir ? '' <EOS>	119.81648821761242
<SOS> he said , making a sign to the queen , who was evidently going to issue a severe order . <EOS>	51.75524305128175
<SOS> `` i was a witness of the last hours of charles i . <EOS>	98.72992013443819
<SOS> poor king ! <EOS>	65.1639500156151
<SOS> culpable , at the most , of weakness , how cruelly punished by his subjects ! <EOS>	53.72437275239359
<SOS> thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes . <EOS>	100.34791889949281
<SOS> this is the second time that monsieur d'artagnan has been in england . <EOS>	103.86000346452843
<SOS> he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen ; the second , to avert the death of a great king . '' <EOS>	86.11421191523027
<SOS> `` sir , '' said anne to mazarin , with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression , `` see if we can do something for these gentlemen . '' <EOS>	62.02914538982678
<SOS> `` i wish to do , madame , all that your majesty pleases . '' <EOS>	54.82787774516154
<SOS> `` do what monsieur de la fere requests ; that is your name , is it not , sir ? '' <EOS>	58.31335041519317
<SOS> `` i have another name , madame i am called athos . '' <EOS>	59.051336168059876
<SOS> `` madame , '' said mazarin , with a smile , `` you may rest easy ; your wishes shall be fulfilled . '' <EOS>	88.7463962508224
<SOS> `` you hear , sir ? '' <EOS>	69.53993884175436
<SOS> said the queen . <EOS>	58.05167696362722
<SOS> `` yes , madame , i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty . <EOS>	107.38597877799086
<SOS> may i not go and see my friends ? '' <EOS>	47.68869244650327
<SOS> `` yes , sir , you shall see them . <EOS>	81.2897206326895
<SOS> but , apropos , you belong to the fronde , do you not ? '' <EOS>	72.23158425397672
<SOS> `` madame , i serve the king . '' <EOS>	92.67275829760314
<SOS> `` yes , in your own way . '' <EOS>	92.57537540258659
<SOS> `` my way is the way of all gentlemen , and i know only one way , '' answered athos , haughtily . <EOS>	85.98439654393736
<SOS> `` go , sir , then , '' said the queen ; `` you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know . '' <EOS>	84.21039402106841
<SOS> scarcely , however , had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin : `` cardinal , desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court . '' <EOS>	70.25235550260851
<SOS> `` your majesty , '' answered mazarin , `` desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do . <EOS>	89.63569704591633
<SOS> these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome ; since there are two of them already there , let us add a third . '' <EOS>	47.70699372444431
<SOS> athos was not altogether the queen 's dupe , but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all , when distinctly told that he should see his friends again . <EOS>	92.61120897187244
<SOS> he waited , then , in the ante chamber with impatience , till he should be conducted to them . <EOS>	54.13640713857536
<SOS> he walked to the window and looked into the court . <EOS>	57.02824470685464
<SOS> he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it ; they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen . <EOS>	95.96383492055404
<SOS> a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates . <EOS>	111.24524742749858
<SOS> athos was looking on attentively , when some one touched him softly on the shoulder . <EOS>	96.13802640370552
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	105.32917245037356
<SOS> monsieur de comminges , '' he said . <EOS>	58.240430273757696
<SOS> `` yes , count , and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses . '' <EOS>	65.74533705995512
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	109.70700979458975
<SOS> `` be so good as to give me up your sword , count . '' <EOS>	49.62244170974937
<SOS> athos smiled and opened the window . <EOS>	61.46343221030563
<SOS> `` aramis ! '' <EOS>	87.72740410538651
<SOS> he cried . <EOS>	63.4452571287487
<SOS> a gentleman turned around . <EOS>	108.76391542819403
<SOS> athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd . <EOS>	49.06162985620685
<SOS> it was aramis . <EOS>	104.56212519498297
<SOS> he bowed with great friendship to the count . <EOS>	77.52837732343738
<SOS> `` aramis , '' cried athos , `` i am arrested . '' <EOS>	82.76043854536438
<SOS> `` good , '' replied aramis , calmly . <EOS>	72.9348187441128
<SOS> `` sir , '' said athos , turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt , `` here is my sword ; have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison . <EOS>	78.47220997781261
<SOS> i prize it it was given to my ancestor by king francis i . <EOS>	115.22838312595765
<SOS> in his time they armed gentlemen , not disarmed them . <EOS>	76.00598354390984
<SOS> now , whither do you conduct me ? '' <EOS>	107.3920042273193
<SOS> `` into my room first , '' replied comminges ; `` the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile . '' <EOS>	66.88247170025647
<SOS> athos followed comminges without saying a single word . <EOS>	78.96215867227045
<SOS> chapter lxxxi . <EOS>	45.76819342298722
<SOS> cardinal mazarin as king . <EOS>	61.18168228415505
<SOS> the arrest produced no sensation , indeed was almost unknown , and scarcely interrupted the course of events . <EOS>	75.18676763262127
<SOS> to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it . <EOS>	84.91153958399379
<SOS> accordingly , it was admitted to the presence of anne , who , silent and lofty as ever , listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies ; but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say , so calm remained her face , whether or no she had heard them . <EOS>	105.79017265897349
<SOS> on the other hand , mazarin , present at that audience , heard very well what those deputies demanded . <EOS>	90.86791280103901
<SOS> it was purely and simply his removal , in terms clear and precise . <EOS>	84.45673860598907
<SOS> the discourse being finished , the queen remained silent . <EOS>	87.06495998519406
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said mazarin , `` i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects . <EOS>	55.93678040207253
<SOS> i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public , you say , is that they proceed from me , an unhappy foreigner , who has been unable to please the french . <EOS>	73.05444298402936
<SOS> alas ! <EOS>	63.91086396365042
<SOS> i have never been understood , and no wonder . <EOS>	94.8361881093771
<SOS> i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france . <EOS>	63.75007696861721
<SOS> the memory of richelieu annihilates me . <EOS>	93.89445234447889
<SOS> in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left ; but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you . <EOS>	49.23500347591895
<SOS> i own myself conquered . <EOS>	68.40858770800158
<SOS> i shall obey the wishes of the people . <EOS>	62.444854737891454
<SOS> if paris has injuries to complain of , who has not some wrongs to be redressed ? <EOS>	72.33272649480341
<SOS> paris has been sufficiently punished ; enough blood has flowed , enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice . <EOS>	99.70373666202961
<SOS> 't is not for me , a private individual , to disunite a queen from her kingdom . <EOS>	86.4955621343611
<SOS> since you demand my resignation , i retire . '' <EOS>	83.64137278724839
<SOS> `` then , '' said aramis , in his neighbor 's ear , `` the conferences are over . <EOS>	69.69844228060529
<SOS> there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that , nor any other entrance into france . '' <EOS>	55.307649559260746
<SOS> `` one instant , sir , '' said the man in a gown , whom he addressed ; `` a plague o n't ! <EOS>	72.69651857477407
<SOS> how fast you go ! <EOS>	64.00536845503154
<SOS> one may soon see that you 're a soldier . <EOS>	69.8877772671021
<SOS> there 's the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights . '' <EOS>	90.48473593456447
<SOS> `` chancellor , '' said the queen , turning to seguier , our old acquaintance , `` you will open the conferences . <EOS>	81.23581531354586
<SOS> they can take place at rueil . <EOS>	63.24150930310594
<SOS> the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me , therefore i will not speak more fully now . <EOS>	39.42162405790613
<SOS> as to his going or staying , i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions ; he shall do what he wishes to do . '' <EOS>	86.42372995419814
<SOS> a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister ; he looked at the queen with anxiety . <EOS>	78.46060322604359
<SOS> her face was so passionless , that he , as every one else present , was incapable of reading her thoughts . <EOS>	95.3318126459808
<SOS> `` but , '' added the queen , `` in awaiting the cardinal 's decision let there be , if you please , a reference to the king only . '' <EOS>	57.43443868521998
<SOS> the deputies bowed and left the room . <EOS>	73.28889113078459
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	53.93018453407374
<SOS> exclaimed the queen , when the last of them had quitted the apartment , `` you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates ? '' <EOS>	67.58174193141488
<SOS> `` to promote your majesty 's welfare , madame , '' replied mazarin , fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen , `` there is no sacrifice that i would not make . '' <EOS>	94.03087904075348
<SOS> anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her . <EOS>	75.73555739688581
<SOS> a recollection of athos came into her mind . <EOS>	87.03614664788589
<SOS> his fearless deportment , his words , so firm , yet dignified , the shades which by one word he had evoked , recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance , youth , beauty , the eclat of love at twenty years of age , the bloody death of buckingham , the only man whom she had ever really loved , and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king . <EOS>	75.11261486215554
<SOS> mazarin looked at her , and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts , he read her thoughts in her countenance , as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections , like thoughts , of the heavens . <EOS>	46.97161068690942
<SOS> `` must we , then , '' asked anne of austria , `` yield to the storm , buy peace , and patiently and piously await better times ? '' <EOS>	60.36140288340943
<SOS> mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech , which showed that she had taken the minister 's proposal seriously . <EOS>	56.06991335451451
<SOS> anne 's head was bent down she had not seen the italian 's smile ; but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up . <EOS>	82.07195095740852
<SOS> `` well , you do not answer , cardinal , what do you think about it ? '' <EOS>	64.104458014662
<SOS> `` i am thinking , madame , of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman , whom you have caused to be arrested , to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse , whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort , whom you imprisoned ; but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you . '' <EOS>	93.52593817368235
<SOS> anne drew up , as she always did , when anything touched her pride . <EOS>	71.24616444123204
<SOS> she blushed , and that she might not answer , clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them . <EOS>	61.935326795473
<SOS> `` that man has sagacity , honor and wit , not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution . <EOS>	54.90269224924256
<SOS> you know something about him , do you not , madame ? <EOS>	68.50942575398344
<SOS> i shall tell him , therefore , and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him , how he is mistaken in regard to me . <EOS>	91.20676632669216
<SOS> what is proposed to me would be , in fact , almost an abdication , and an abdication requires reflection . '' <EOS>	44.48521433984723
<SOS> `` an abdication ? '' <EOS>	73.51882831890383
<SOS> repeated anne ; `` i thought , sir , that it was kings alone who abdicated ! '' <EOS>	44.64551165230734
<SOS> `` well , '' replied mazarin , `` and am i not almost a king king , indeed , of france ? <EOS>	66.52022495901741
<SOS> thrown over the foot of the royal bed , my simar , madame , looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings . '' <EOS>	54.62213721926143
<SOS> this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other , and one that bowed her head with shame . <EOS>	86.960134764021
<SOS> queen elizabeth and catherine ii . <EOS>	47.73645092153246
<SOS> of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers . <EOS>	102.55766167209762
<SOS> anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur . <EOS>	79.68063467744972
<SOS> `` sir , '' she replied , `` did i not say , and did you not hear me say to those people , that you should do as you pleased ? '' <EOS>	67.64764140013817
<SOS> `` in that case , '' said mazarin , `` i think it must please me best to remain ; not only on account of my own interest , but for your safety . '' <EOS>	64.78676153911483
<SOS> `` remain , then , sir ; nothing can be more agreeable to me ; only do not allow me to be insulted . '' <EOS>	49.34813599730761
<SOS> `` you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them ? <EOS>	68.6990077073471

<SOS> they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference . <EOS>	59.96339420530295
<SOS> no , we shall beat them by merely temporizing . <EOS>	71.04183711683996
<SOS> they want food already . <EOS>	90.8997361553329
<SOS> they will be ten times worse off in a week . '' <EOS>	103.46219278847221
<SOS> `` ah , yes ! <EOS>	52.480020989006256
<SOS> good heavens ! <EOS>	51.82374590323725
<SOS> i know it will end in that way ; but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches , but `` `` i understand ; you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen . <EOS>	63.90746787978742

<SOS> but , devil take him ! <EOS>	52.72514063713597
<SOS> we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions . <EOS>	105.17217016439389
<SOS> we have accomplished more difficult things than that . <EOS>	92.81249142051878
<SOS> in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil , near me , under my own eyes , within reach of my hand , the two most intractable ones . <EOS>	104.2789765008364
<SOS> to day the third will be there also . '' <EOS>	68.75237711642069
<SOS> `` as long as they are in prison all will be well , '' said anne , `` but one of these days they will get out . '' <EOS>	57.10494929503558
<SOS> `` yes , if your majesty releases them . '' <EOS>	94.55579660487314
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	83.09635362968574
<SOS> exclaimed anne , following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions , `` one regrets paris ! '' <EOS>	89.93949619589313
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	65.19600650135514
<SOS> `` on account of the bastile , sir , which is so strong and so secure . '' <EOS>	86.89550166475074
<SOS> `` madame , these conferences will bring us peace ; when we have peace we shall regain paris ; with paris , the bastile , and our four bullies shall rot therein . '' <EOS>	58.05637868351676
<SOS> anne frowned slightly when mazarin , in taking leave , kissed her hand . <EOS>	52.366576004970554

<SOS> anne followed him with her eyes , and as he withdrew , at every step he took , a disdainful smile was seen playing , then gradually burst upon her lips . <EOS>	51.45975565289729

<SOS> precautions . <EOS>	80.76160955992378
<SOS> after quitting anne , mazarin took the road to rueil , where he usually resided ; in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself . <EOS>	76.31784954167384
<SOS> in military dress he was , indeed , as we have stated , a very handsome man . <EOS>	80.87322447953413
<SOS> in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach , and reached the seine at chatou . <EOS>	73.62506622162546
<SOS> the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse , not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen 's generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure . <EOS>	64.847659830954
<SOS> athos , on horseback , without his sword and kept in sight by comminges , followed the cardinal in silence . <EOS>	87.3524368324363
<SOS> grimaud , finding that his master had been arrested , fell back into the ranks near aramis , without saying a word and as if nothing had happened . <EOS>	56.24517769452392
<SOS> grimaud had , indeed , during twenty two years of service , seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos 's imminent death was likely to make him uneasy . <EOS>	48.50306297764137
<SOS> at the branching off of the road toward paris , aramis , who had followed in the cardinal 's suite , turned back . <EOS>	90.70144362922156
<SOS> mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue . <EOS>	81.12349620626722
<SOS> athos , at the same moment , moved by a similar impulse , looked back also . <EOS>	78.73230789624698
<SOS> the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat , as if to bow , athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head . <EOS>	119.79227433144636
<SOS> ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil ; as he alighted , comminges approached him . <EOS>	68.2100359097806
<SOS> `` my lord , '' he asked , `` where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged ? '' <EOS>	57.984897899311186
<SOS> `` in the pavilion of the orangery , of course , in front of the pavilion where the guard is . <EOS>	82.26980088320424
<SOS> i wish every respect to be shown the count , although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen . '' <EOS>	88.32825785138392
<SOS> `` my lord , '' answered comminges , `` he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d'artagnan is confined that is , in the hunting lodge , opposite the orangery . '' <EOS>	79.05342639144953
<SOS> mazarin thought for an instant . <EOS>	75.06562139142164
<SOS> comminges saw that he was undecided . <EOS>	84.65278182008146
<SOS> `` 't is a very strong post , '' he resumed , `` and we have forty good men , tried soldiers , having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde . '' <EOS>	59.00414997141669
<SOS> `` if we put these three men together , monsieur comminges , '' said mazarin , `` we must double the guard , and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality . '' <EOS>	58.27136636224443
<SOS> comminges smiled ; mazarin read and construed that smile . <EOS>	69.35812620374384
<SOS> `` you do not know these men , monsieur comminges , but i know them , first personally , also by hearsay . <EOS>	51.657569929499125
<SOS> i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him ; had it not been for an adverse destiny , that beloved monarch would this day have been among us . '' <EOS>	61.85798290212555
<SOS> `` but since they served your eminence so well , why are they , my lord cardinal , in prison ? '' <EOS>	99.0332780975202
<SOS> `` in prison ? '' <EOS>	97.21403147236359
<SOS> said mazarin , `` and when has rueil been a prison ? '' <EOS>	71.26093165994205
<SOS> `` ever since there were prisoners in it , '' answered comminges . <EOS>	61.85562990688102
<SOS> `` these gentlemen , comminges , are not prisoners , '' returned mazarin , with his ironical smile , `` only guests ; but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors , that they may not refuse to continue my visitors . <EOS>	74.12030155329083
<SOS> so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit , that i may converse with him tete a tete , and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him , as i said before , to the pavilion of the orangery ; that , you know , is my daily promenade . <EOS>	75.23916836846381
<SOS> well , while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk . <EOS>	58.76894547070337
<SOS> although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him , and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters . '' <EOS>	88.42074486074227
<SOS> comminges bowed , and returned to athos , who was awaiting with apparent calmness , but with real anxiety , the result of the interview . <EOS>	122.54211199922614
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	64.99110120422291
<SOS> he said to the lieutenant . <EOS>	77.05513798578437
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied comminges , `` it seems that it is impossible . '' <EOS>	82.39174898727585
<SOS> `` monsieur de comminges , '' said athos , `` i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders ; but outside your orders there is a service you can render me . '' <EOS>	88.57088130446812
<SOS> `` i will do it with all my heart , '' said comminges ; `` for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty ; i know , too , how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested . <EOS>	76.38062633397415
<SOS> i am entirely at your service , except only for my orders . '' <EOS>	100.29701200648346
<SOS> `` thank you , sir ; what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree . '' <EOS>	69.3704100377918
<SOS> `` if it should even compromise me a little , '' said monsieur de comminges , with a smile , `` still make your demand . <EOS>	63.30893900040657
<SOS> i do n't like mazarin any better than you do . <EOS>	62.01401703760413
<SOS> i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal ; but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will . <EOS>	89.37889535691377
<SOS> speak , then , i beg of you ; i wait and listen . '' <EOS>	85.37122264530348
<SOS> `` since there is no harm , '' said athos , `` in my knowing that d'artagnan is here , i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here . '' <EOS>	69.43302409948852
<SOS> `` i have received no orders on that point . '' <EOS>	57.75297807861196
<SOS> `` well , then , do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor . <EOS>	72.83364420588921
<SOS> tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit , and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity . '' <EOS>	55.26906032023794
<SOS> `` which can not last , '' interrupted comminges ; `` the cardinal said so ; there is no prison here . '' <EOS>	55.58511307326304
<SOS> `` but there are oubliettes ! '' <EOS>	60.93591403642193
<SOS> replied athos , smiling . <EOS>	63.98737858040343
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	49.70587021800147
<SOS> that 's a different thing ; yes , i know there are traditions of that sort , '' said comminges . <EOS>	62.396392224520525
<SOS> `` it was in the time of the other cardinal , who was a great nobleman ; but our mazarin impossible ! <EOS>	49.98129870030303
<SOS> an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves . <EOS>	61.19971073036626
<SOS> oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance , and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them . <EOS>	56.12286186605825
<SOS> your arrest is known , that of your friends will soon be known ; and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance . <EOS>	78.5521646089404
<SOS> no , no , be easy on that score . <EOS>	57.86006697372886
<SOS> i will , however , inform monsieur d'artagnan of your arrival here . '' <EOS>	84.42204928672172
<SOS> comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion , at the end of the orangery . <EOS>	60.2117610854293
<SOS> they passed through a courtyard as they went , full of soldiers and courtiers . <EOS>	59.0199716162427
<SOS> in the centre of this court , in the form of a horseshoe , were the buildings occupied by mazarin , and at each wing the pavilion ( or smaller building ) , where d'artagnan was confined , and that , level with the orangery , where athos was to be . <EOS>	85.66232217718178
<SOS> from the ends of these two wings extended the park . <EOS>	69.45790804760045
<SOS> athos , when he reached his appointed room , observed through the gratings of his window , walls and roofs ; and was told , on inquiry , by comminges , that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d'artagnan was confined . <EOS>	62.84067195396479
<SOS> `` yes , 't is too true , '' said comminges , `` 't is almost a prison ; but what a singular fancy this is of yours , count you , who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts , the frondists ! <EOS>	58.95618178245349
<SOS> really , count , if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army , it was you . <EOS>	70.25098749295228
<SOS> a frondeur ! <EOS>	55.923428930110866
<SOS> you , the comte de la fere , on the side of broussel , blancmesnil and viole ! <EOS>	74.42364743881646
<SOS> for shame ! <EOS>	76.43192851378582
<SOS> you , a frondeur ! '' <EOS>	105.12227840904495
<SOS> `` on my word of honor , '' said athos , `` one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur . <EOS>	40.4102171962585
<SOS> for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears , and i chose the latter ; at any rate , it is a french word . <EOS>	78.44111473806043
<SOS> and now , i am a frondeur not of broussel 's party , nor of blancmesnil 's , nor am i with viole ; but with the duc de beaufort , the ducs de bouillon and d'elbeuf ; with princes , not with presidents , councillors and low born lawyers . <EOS>	49.85950570732837
<SOS> besides , what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal ! <EOS>	52.792042904249456
<SOS> look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about mazarin 's gratitude ! '' <EOS>	108.45537405441324
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied de comminges , `` more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d'artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him . '' <EOS>	39.8003339541918
<SOS> `` poor d'artagnan ' '' said athos , with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character , `` so brave , so good , so terrible to the enemies of those he loves . <EOS>	44.04594431209767
<SOS> you have two unruly prisoners there , sir . '' <EOS>	41.76301190145107
<SOS> `` unruly , '' comminges smiled ; `` you wish to terrify me , i suppose . <EOS>	71.21056576122868
<SOS> when he came here , monsieur d'artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers , in order , i suppose , to have his sword back . <EOS>	70.67893542210912
<SOS> that mood lasted some time ; but now he 's as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs , which make one die of laughing . '' <EOS>	67.83202627023998
<SOS> `` and du vallon ? '' <EOS>	86.2455783688148
<SOS> asked athos . <EOS>	84.37263069230134
<SOS> `` ah , he 's quite another sort of person a formidable gentleman , indeed . <EOS>	86.91077474837952
<SOS> the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder ; and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza . <EOS>	55.822058491655014
<SOS> but his temper cooled down , like his friend 's ; he not only gets used to his captivity , but jokes about it . '' <EOS>	50.71383130452519
<SOS> `` so much the better , '' said athos . <EOS>	63.57102319224135
<SOS> `` do you think anything else was to be expected of them ? '' <EOS>	88.57957952399012
<SOS> asked comminges , who , putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said , began to feel a degree of uneasiness . <EOS>	89.14617744678489
<SOS> athos , on the other hand , reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d'artagnan . <EOS>	100.88470729962985
<SOS> unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly , he replied : `` they ? <EOS>	93.36512828261812
<SOS> they are two hotheads the one a gascon , the other from picardy ; both are easily excited , but they quiet down immediately . <EOS>	62.01999758028143
<SOS> you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me . '' <EOS>	53.177654325145866
<SOS> this , too , was the opinion of comminges , who withdrew somewhat reassured . <EOS>	59.323743885830886
<SOS> athos remained alone in the vast chamber , where , according to the cardinal 's directions , he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman . <EOS>	43.20207666046955
<SOS> he awaited mazarin 's promised visit to get some light on his present situation . <EOS>	91.36470321713225
<SOS> chapter lxxxiii . <EOS>	100.50567791550046
<SOS> strength and sagacity . <EOS>	58.45372152140724
<SOS> now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge . <EOS>	58.53603924079691
<SOS> at the extremity of the courtyard , where , close to a portico formed of ionic columns , were the dog kennels , rose an oblong building , the pavilion of the orangery , a half circle , inclosing the court of honor . <EOS>	72.7119626523328
<SOS> it was in this pavilion , on the ground floor , that d'artagnan and porthos were confined , suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament . <EOS>	65.78427433479185
<SOS> d'artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger ; with dilated eyes , growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant 's offices . <EOS>	94.868311416112
<SOS> porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished . <EOS>	93.72143637359238
<SOS> the one seemed to be deprived of reason , yet he was meditating . <EOS>	55.299989785068654
<SOS> the other seemed to meditate , yet he was more than half asleep . <EOS>	57.256090428396696
<SOS> but his sleep was a nightmare , which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted . <EOS>	94.31213117599096
<SOS> `` look , '' said d'artagnan , `` day is declining . <EOS>	72.28095553952834
<SOS> it must be nearly four o'clock . <EOS>	55.64001348926455
<SOS> we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours . '' <EOS>	77.6411286515
<SOS> `` hem ! '' <EOS>	62.21235690395294
<SOS> muttered porthos , with a kind of pretense of answering . <EOS>	59.92705603106367
<SOS> `` did you hear , eternal sleeper ? '' <EOS>	66.24382301812302
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , irritated that any one could doze during the day , when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night . <EOS>	48.67196027545724
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	89.95292288390468
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	79.66113525415179
<SOS> `` i say we have been here eighty three hours . '' <EOS>	81.53161294302781
<SOS> `` 't is your fault , '' answered porthos . <EOS>	64.96739033596147
<SOS> `` how , my fault ? '' <EOS>	61.55838120140426
<SOS> `` yes , i offered you escape . '' <EOS>	88.9524303378104
<SOS> `` by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door ? '' <EOS>	78.70311095464784
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	70.68774711713046
<SOS> `` porthos , men like us ca n't go out from here purely and simply . '' <EOS>	65.1408951524365
<SOS> `` faith ! '' <EOS>	93.1320767113063
<SOS> said porthos , `` as for me , i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much . '' <EOS>	59.3939072967369
<SOS> d'artagnan shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	96.0361294011397
<SOS> `` and besides , '' he said , `` going out of this chamber is n't all . '' <EOS>	78.84736297375046
<SOS> `` dear friend , '' said porthos , `` you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday . <EOS>	96.75405561144528
<SOS> explain to me why going out of this chamber is n't everything . '' <EOS>	65.98213237711902
<SOS> `` because , having neither arms nor password , we should n't take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel . '' <EOS>	72.14952666623955
<SOS> `` very well , '' said porthos , `` we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms . '' <EOS>	65.45201085391481
<SOS> `` yes , but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill , that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come , and we shall be taken like foxes , we , who are lions , and thrown into some dungeon , where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil , which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun . <EOS>	104.9774011079425
<SOS> lack a day ! <EOS>	85.97604754846245
<SOS> if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle . <EOS>	62.352888173061714
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	77.08627363113168
<SOS> when one thinks that for twenty years , during which time i did not know what to do with myself , it never occurred to me to come to study rueil . '' <EOS>	74.0426028488006
<SOS> `` what difference does that make ? '' <EOS>	61.78215503116309
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	76.93622135864061
<SOS> `` we shall go out all the same . '' <EOS>	73.03617974527258
<SOS> `` do you know , my dear fellow , why master pastrycooks never work with their hands ? '' <EOS>	106.9372846185866
<SOS> `` no , '' said porthos , `` but i should be glad to be informed . '' <EOS>	42.17362387220017
<SOS> `` it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked . '' <EOS>	93.74675492540568
<SOS> `` what then ? '' <EOS>	50.013208690980434
<SOS> `` why , then they would be laughed at , and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at . '' <EOS>	67.6333674733506
<SOS> `` and what have master pastrycooks to do with us ? '' <EOS>	103.88154392944814
<SOS> `` we ought , in our adventures , never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us . <EOS>	89.80860944876977
<SOS> in england , lately , we failed , we were beaten , and that is a blemish on our reputation . '' <EOS>	84.45749387576922
<SOS> `` by whom , then , were we beaten ? '' <EOS>	59.81648438594448
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	57.91280549511373
<SOS> `` by mordaunt . '' <EOS>	65.01841600744835
<SOS> `` yes , but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt . '' <EOS>	95.68497405661063
<SOS> `` that is true , and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity , if posterity ever looks at us . <EOS>	46.74340092201785
<SOS> but listen , porthos : though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised , mazarin is not less strong than he , and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him . <EOS>	81.54784051019612
<SOS> we must , therefore , watch and play a close game ; for , '' he added with a sigh , `` we two are equal , perhaps , to eight others ; but we are not equal to the four that you know of . '' <EOS>	84.43971337045836
<SOS> `` that is true , '' said porthos , echoing d'artagnan 's sigh . <EOS>	57.25394393599378
<SOS> `` well , porthos , follow my examples ; walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea . <EOS>	101.01438128342022
<SOS> but do n't sleep as you do all the time ; nothing dulls the intellect like sleep . <EOS>	72.95434056645473
<SOS> as to what may lie before us , it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought . <EOS>	68.14824905240096
<SOS> i do n't believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads , for heads are not taken off without previous trial ; a trial would make a noise , and a noise would get the attention of our friends , who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin . '' <EOS>	67.04322641861935
<SOS> `` how well you reason ! '' <EOS>	63.67111238023455
<SOS> said porthos , admiringly . <EOS>	69.64190557487385
<SOS> `` well , yes , pretty well , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` and besides , you see , if they put us on trial , if they cut off our heads , they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere . '' <EOS>	56.85499286986616
<SOS> `` yes , that is inevitable , '' said porthos . <EOS>	83.95501243503264
<SOS> `` well , it is impossible but that master aramis , that keen scented bloodhound , and athos , that wise and prudent nobleman , will discover our retreat . <EOS>	107.96602520556152
<SOS> then , believe me , it will be time to act . '' <EOS>	71.1266343383333
<SOS> `` yes , we will wait . <EOS>	87.73406084365668
<SOS> we can wait the more contentedly , that it is not absolutely bad here , but for one thing , at least . '' <EOS>	57.513086943888915
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	98.13212046002734
<SOS> `` did you observe , d'artagnan , that three days running they have brought us braised mutton ? '' <EOS>	90.37974753931938
<SOS> `` no ; but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it , so never mind . '' <EOS>	66.28438344870246
<SOS> `` and then i feel the loss of my house , 't is a long time since i visited my castles . '' <EOS>	57.56992435425855
<SOS> `` forget them for a time ; we shall return to them , unless mazarin razes them to the ground . '' <EOS>	67.57097443129493
<SOS> `` do you think that likely ? '' <EOS>	70.13440490265563
<SOS> `` no , the other cardinal would have done so , but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it . '' <EOS>	63.827863870025
<SOS> `` you reconcile me , d'artagnan . '' <EOS>	76.85641853308896
<SOS> `` well , then , assume a cheerful manner , as i do ; we must joke with the guards , we must gain the good will of the soldiers , since we ca n't corrupt them . <EOS>	64.44849915842336
<SOS> try , porthos , to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows . <EOS>	53.23619978821627
<SOS> thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist ; and the more respectable your fist is , porthos , the less attractive it is . <EOS>	72.80979024236964
<SOS> ah , i would give much to have five hundred louis , only . '' <EOS>	72.7542922164458
<SOS> `` so would i , '' said porthos , unwilling to be behind d'artagnan in generosity ; `` i would give as much as a hundred pistoles . '' <EOS>	100.67265576409145
<SOS> the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered , preceded by a sergeant and two men , who brought supper in a basket with two handles , filled with basins and plates . <EOS>	78.13072815462458
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	67.19418877257816
<SOS> exclaimed porthos , `` mutton again ? '' <EOS>	50.51061720542183
<SOS> `` my dear monsieur de comminges , '' said d'artagnan , `` you will find that my friend , monsieur du vallon , will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat ; mutton every day . '' <EOS>	90.09266733831585
<SOS> `` i declare , '' said porthos , `` i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away . '' <EOS>	53.87667032855987
<SOS> `` remove the mutton , '' cried comminges ; `` i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well , more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite . '' <EOS>	103.80316236158097
<SOS> `` is mazarin dead ? '' <EOS>	101.44524621600941
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	60.30736956194881
<SOS> `` no ; i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well . '' <EOS>	67.99103411665362
<SOS> `` so much the worse , '' said porthos . <EOS>	82.68004195195462
<SOS> `` what is that news ? '' <EOS>	88.35960460103873
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	65.60371830789404
<SOS> `` news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust , monsieur de comminges , you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good . '' <EOS>	84.52335526910666
<SOS> `` should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well ? '' <EOS>	58.60186572741112
<SOS> asked de comminges . <EOS>	55.67264344342994
<SOS> d'artagnan 's penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost . <EOS>	80.30289900246873
<SOS> `` glad ! '' <EOS>	81.38174430253738
<SOS> he cried ; `` i should be more than glad ! <EOS>	86.73092025530978
<SOS> happy beyond measure ! '' <EOS>	77.8095440872576
<SOS> `` well , i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health . '' <EOS>	47.231034487864314
<SOS> d'artagnan almost leaped with joy . <EOS>	60.31061780969115
<SOS> a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos : `` if athos knows where we are , if he opens communication with us , before long athos will act . '' <EOS>	82.87682700313054
<SOS> porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances , but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea , he understood . <EOS>	69.05584027441859
<SOS> `` do you say , '' asked the gascon , timidly , `` that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself ? '' <EOS>	77.33090712787074
<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	96.54704475694055
<SOS> `` then you have seen him ? '' <EOS>	51.62273002545146
<SOS> `` certainly i have . '' <EOS>	61.94746798770439
<SOS> `` where ? <EOS>	84.46629400150103
<SOS> if i may ask without indiscretion . '' <EOS>	51.15373356192281
<SOS> `` near here , '' replied de comminges , smiling ; `` so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are . '' <EOS>	61.638200870232396
<SOS> `` he is wandering about the environs of the castle , '' thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.35820831996008
<SOS> then he said aloud : `` you met him , i dare say , in the park hunting , perhaps ? '' <EOS>	86.96630530975317
<SOS> `` no ; nearer , nearer still . <EOS>	101.88091788099891
<SOS> look , behind this wall , '' said de comminges , knocking against the wall . <EOS>	67.72421810278729
<SOS> `` behind this wall ? <EOS>	76.6477629790137
<SOS> what is there , then , behind this wall ? <EOS>	93.16098703151464
<SOS> i was brought here by night , so devil take me if i know where i am . '' <EOS>	77.5872891181938
<SOS> `` well , '' said comminges , `` suppose one thing . '' <EOS>	51.30070071453638
<SOS> `` i will suppose anything you please . '' <EOS>	106.98207124216373
<SOS> `` suppose there were a window in this wall . '' <EOS>	92.8943176024177
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	64.13458263571074
<SOS> `` from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his . '' <EOS>	49.98215739898636
<SOS> `` the count , then , is in the chateau ? '' <EOS>	65.22635577727904
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	68.20873724354901
<SOS> `` for what reason ? '' <EOS>	66.1986890623878
<SOS> `` the same as yourself . '' <EOS>	100.10785326025024
<SOS> `` athos a prisoner ? '' <EOS>	61.60390578615216
<SOS> `` you know well , '' replied de comminges , `` that there are no prisoners at rueil , because there is no prison . '' <EOS>	78.00665278938757
<SOS> `` do n't let us play upon words , sir . <EOS>	67.73773175514239
<SOS> athos has been arrested . '' <EOS>	60.04669166635168
<SOS> `` yesterday , at saint germain , as he came out from the presence of the queen . '' <EOS>	72.13621441555925
<SOS> the arms of d'artagnan fell powerless by his side . <EOS>	79.16582413601957
<SOS> one might have supposed him thunderstruck ; a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin , but disappeared immediately . <EOS>	60.31237490784812
<SOS> `` a prisoner ? '' <EOS>	46.811912918356484
<SOS> he reiterated . <EOS>	107.07922791336809
<SOS> `` a prisoner , '' repeated porthos , quite dejected . <EOS>	84.32903141726948
<SOS> suddenly d'artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed ; but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before . <EOS>	67.21129461172642
<SOS> `` come , come , '' said comminges , who , since d'artagnan , on the day of broussel 's arrest , had saved him from the hands of the parisians , had entertained a real affection for him , `` do n't be unhappy ; i never thought of bringing you bad news . <EOS>	81.80849950062394
<SOS> laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon , instead of being in the depths of despair about it . '' <EOS>	58.42073095942476
<SOS> but d'artagnan was still in a desponding mood . <EOS>	74.78646360065481
<SOS> `` and how did he look ? '' <EOS>	89.37964336870772
<SOS> asked porthos , who , perceiving that d'artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop , profited by it to put in a word or two . <EOS>	100.19787212389888
<SOS> `` very well , indeed , sir , '' replied comminges ; `` at first , like you , he seemed distressed ; but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening `` `` ah ! '' <EOS>	106.71463862599906
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere ? '' <EOS>	68.72713738963736
<SOS> `` yes ; and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself . '' <EOS>	41.984784005535026
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	59.15122153929086
<SOS> our dear count ! '' <EOS>	52.45261589578018
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	60.103389826168936
<SOS> `` a fine thing , indeed ! '' <EOS>	74.64833068487916
<SOS> grunted porthos . <EOS>	62.08379039281226
<SOS> `` a great favor ! <EOS>	84.97143499339738
<SOS> zounds ! <EOS>	77.41149398508202
<SOS> monsieur the comte de la fere , whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan , is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin . '' <EOS>	63.15196252382157
<SOS> `` no matter , '' said d'artagnan , in his most wheedling tone . <EOS>	89.17395273001452
<SOS> `` on reflection , my dear du vallon , it is a great honor for the comte de la fere , and gives good reason to hope . <EOS>	83.25885643382385
<SOS> in fact , it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken . '' <EOS>	54.62353961431798
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	119.80254046486878
<SOS> i am mistaken ? '' <EOS>	57.1776180938205
<SOS> `` monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere , but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him . '' <EOS>	93.57325040662232
<SOS> `` no , no , no , '' said comminges , who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were , `` i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me . <EOS>	58.31672269528881
<SOS> he will come and visit the comte de la fere . '' <EOS>	57.166198048917686
<SOS> d'artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit , but porthos did not even look toward him . <EOS>	74.23042405646777
<SOS> `` it is , then , the cardinal 's custom to walk in his orangery ? '' <EOS>	95.73770325556146
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	90.33405827290443
<SOS> `` every evening he shuts himself in there . <EOS>	116.597732500364
<SOS> that , it seems , is where he meditates on state affairs . '' <EOS>	87.46721253536963
<SOS> `` in that case , '' said d'artagnan , `` i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence ; he will , of course , have an escort . '' <EOS>	55.68604625244929
<SOS> `` yes two soldiers . '' <EOS>	107.70543763611202
<SOS> `` and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers ? '' <EOS>	71.59886904762554
<SOS> `` the soldiers are swiss , who understand only german . <EOS>	83.19900810116265
<SOS> besides , according to all probability they will wait at the door . '' <EOS>	59.29697435712713
<SOS> d'artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive . <EOS>	55.82597467495763
<SOS> `` let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere , '' said d'artagnan ; `` for the count must be furious . '' <EOS>	85.26510717986596
<SOS> comminges began to laugh . <EOS>	53.33049319381225
<SOS> `` oh , oh ! <EOS>	121.66546660771566
<SOS> why , really , one would say that you four were anthropaphagi ! <EOS>	71.02813022496117
<SOS> the count is an affable man ; besides , he is unarmed ; at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance . '' <EOS>	88.28603012826566
<SOS> `` two soldiers , '' said d'artagnan , seeming to remember something , `` two soldiers , yes ; that , then , is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour , under my window . '' <EOS>	79.61968553724496
<SOS> `` that is it ; they are waiting for the cardinal , or rather for bernouin , who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out . '' <EOS>	69.58998026952769
<SOS> `` fine looking men , upon my word ! '' <EOS>	85.49102117118841
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	55.00034256073042
<SOS> `` they belong to the regiment that was at lens , which the prince assigned to the cardinal . '' <EOS>	75.15422631815939
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur , '' said d'artagnan , as if to sum up in a word all that conversation , `` if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty . '' <EOS>	47.20638790733871
<SOS> `` i wish it with all my heart , '' said comminges . <EOS>	62.5809576167178
<SOS> `` then , if he should forget that visit , you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it ? '' <EOS>	58.295087308797356
<SOS> `` not at all . '' <EOS>	69.6604148282427
<SOS> `` ah , that gives me more confidence . '' <EOS>	78.68164967772704
<SOS> this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon 's soul . <EOS>	74.91690408047847
<SOS> `` now , '' said d'artagnan , `` i 've one last favor to ask of you , monsieur de comminges . '' <EOS>	109.45931517965757
<SOS> `` at your service , sir . '' <EOS>	75.58096029442959
<SOS> `` you will see the count again ? '' <EOS>	43.122589721665555
<SOS> `` to morrow morning . '' <EOS>	103.09396291563961
<SOS> `` will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained ? '' <EOS>	74.99302863582477
<SOS> `` you want the cardinal to come here ? '' <EOS>	63.78597488388139
<SOS> `` no ; i know my place and am not so presumptuous . <EOS>	82.18049006253604
<SOS> let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing ; that is all i want . '' <EOS>	61.80263287781123
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	55.05966394697283
<SOS> muttered porthos , shaking his head , `` never should i have thought this of him ! <EOS>	106.75117636162372
<SOS> how misfortune humbles a man ! '' <EOS>	62.66637083291865
<SOS> `` i promise you it shall be done , '' answered de comminges . <EOS>	70.47417628580212
<SOS> `` tell the count that i am well ; that you found me sad , but resigned . '' <EOS>	65.5714572137263
<SOS> `` i am pleased , sir , to hear that . '' <EOS>	50.024806658178825
<SOS> `` and the same , also , for monsieur du vallon `` `` not for me , '' cried porthos ; `` i am not by any means resigned . '' <EOS>	62.64892327990753
<SOS> `` but you will be resigned , my friend . '' <EOS>	82.54844976195955
<SOS> `` never ! '' <EOS>	67.56430949951266
<SOS> `` he will become so , monsieur ; i know him better than he knows himself . <EOS>	54.62892123346456
<SOS> be silent , dear du vallon , and resign yourself . '' <EOS>	56.37962324571091
<SOS> `` adieu , gentlemen , '' said de comminges ; `` sleep well ! '' <EOS>	84.09819805966562
<SOS> `` we will try . '' <EOS>	75.37003585705206
<SOS> de comminges went away , d'artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation ; but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted . <EOS>	60.6151888890016
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	86.10215299706373
<SOS> cried porthos ; `` what 's the matter now ? <EOS>	54.42744011665801
<SOS> have you gone mad , my dear friend ? '' <EOS>	63.66163888137624
<SOS> `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	92.95527319748231
<SOS> returned d'artagnan ; `` we are saved ! '' <EOS>	58.31791787968374
<SOS> `` i do n't see that at all , '' answered porthos . <EOS>	61.01446676457931
<SOS> `` i think we are all taken prisoners , except aramis , and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin 's mousetrap . '' <EOS>	72.60733215467083
<SOS> `` which is far too strong for two of us , but not strong enough for three of us , '' returned d'artagnan . <EOS>	89.84906873686649
<SOS> `` i do n't understand , '' said porthos . <EOS>	71.48415018292862
<SOS> `` never mind ; let 's sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night . '' <EOS>	57.828741178916665
<SOS> `` what are we to do , then , to night ? '' <EOS>	80.4884486231908
<SOS> `` to travel perhaps . '' <EOS>	71.28145652558042
<SOS> `` but `` `` sit down , dear friend , to table . <EOS>	102.31499239539691

<SOS> after supper , when they are perfected , i will communicate my plans to you . '' <EOS>	68.68887428846777
<SOS> so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d'artagnan 's inventive imagination . <EOS>	71.67817226175016
<SOS> chapter lxxxiv . <EOS>	94.20947242530225
<SOS> strength and sagacity continued . <EOS>	56.79602610664929
<SOS> supper was eaten in silence , but not in sadness ; for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of d'artagnan . <EOS>	83.65185535440239
<SOS> not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos ; and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain . <EOS>	97.26900463368739
<SOS> at dessert d'artagnan reposed in his chair , crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease . <EOS>	70.9512672037504
<SOS> porthos rested his chin on his hands , placed his elbows on the table and looked at d'artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship . <EOS>	98.18395718516851
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	74.90616774562247
<SOS> said d'artagnan , at last . <EOS>	92.34056350817846
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	53.942111345862635
<SOS> repeated porthos . <EOS>	98.86607179669177
<SOS> `` you were saying , my dear friend `` `` no ; i said nothing . '' <EOS>	100.52443970803179

<SOS> `` ah , indeed ! <EOS>	119.3281454755489
<SOS> the will was never wanting . '' <EOS>	103.52802012958813

<SOS> `` 't is true i said so , and i say it again . '' <EOS>	53.36845765594025
<SOS> `` and i answered you , porthos , that it was not a good plan ; that we could n't go a hundred steps without being recaptured , because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves . '' <EOS>	48.805259650504055
<SOS> `` that is true ; we should need clothes and arms . '' <EOS>	70.75986183702352
<SOS> `` well , '' said d'artagnan , rising , `` we have them , friend porthos , and even something better . '' <EOS>	105.75986774292306
<SOS> `` bah ! '' <EOS>	57.816089719573206
<SOS> said porthos , looking around . <EOS>	91.58452231747393
<SOS> `` useless to look ; everything will come to us when wanted . <EOS>	51.2521156382004
<SOS> at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday ? '' <EOS>	71.78914888446198

<SOS> `` yes , indeed , '' said he , `` i believe so . '' <EOS>	57.20226675119718

<SOS> `` well , my dear friend , let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar . '' <EOS>	62.86530516495381

<SOS> porthos remained silent and motionless . <EOS>	92.88807004727684
<SOS> in fact , the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was , rubbing their hands , for it was cold , it being the month of february . <EOS>	81.60717134736556
<SOS> at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away . <EOS>	81.03786966307669
<SOS> `` now , '' said d'artagnan , `` i am going to call this soldier and talk to him . <EOS>	83.83827737113917

<SOS> then , raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills , you must pull him into the room , taking care to squeeze him so tight that he ca n't cry out . '' <EOS>	75.32744111332553
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	78.49451961780011

<SOS> `` to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world ; but you will not do so , i hope . <EOS>	61.47674317338218

<SOS> so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword . '' <EOS>	64.11073342322571
<SOS> `` marvelous ! '' <EOS>	85.40646280866274
<SOS> exclaimed porthos , looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration . <EOS>	47.936115141097915
<SOS> `` pooh ! '' <EOS>	87.47696204591693
<SOS> replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	92.20405082351816
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos , recollecting himself , `` but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two . '' <EOS>	57.697980286466446
<SOS> `` well ; but there 's his comrade . '' <EOS>	54.36310762810213
<SOS> `` true , '' said porthos . <EOS>	102.96594520435853

<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	62.21591735826493
<SOS> the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed , porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window . <EOS>	53.75260706097346
<SOS> `` good evening , comrade , '' said d'artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner . <EOS>	62.59347160886658
<SOS> `` good evening , sir , '' answered the soldier , in a strong provincial accent . <EOS>	48.12605666864289
<SOS> `` 't is not too warm to walk , '' resumed d'artagnan . <EOS>	66.2129764121895
<SOS> `` no , sir . '' <EOS>	77.6816710458998
<SOS> `` and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you ? '' <EOS>	102.59774960783174
<SOS> `` a glass of wine will be extremely welcome . '' <EOS>	53.04623407700389
<SOS> `` the fish bites the fish bites ! '' <EOS>	86.5884300302585
<SOS> whispered the gascon to porthos . <EOS>	68.17903918996264
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said porthos . <EOS>	42.68969140018058
<SOS> `` a bottle , perhaps ? '' <EOS>	55.05274699858216
<SOS> `` a whole bottle ? <EOS>	79.25619544583225

<SOS> `` a whole bottle , if you will drink my health . '' <EOS>	54.85612938453896
<SOS> `` willingly , '' answered the soldier . <EOS>	77.95558568614622
<SOS> `` come , then , and take it , friend , '' said the gascon . <EOS>	85.09393190402089
<SOS> `` with all my heart . <EOS>	81.56598760340674
<SOS> how convenient that there 's a bench here . <EOS>	59.796896193545635
<SOS> egad ! <EOS>	62.55641984736723
<SOS> one would think it had been placed here on purpose . '' <EOS>	103.47024844581854
<SOS> `` get on it ; that 's it , friend . '' <EOS>	59.063505143716625
<SOS> and d'artagnan coughed . <EOS>	80.31074634672622
<SOS> that instant the arm of porthos fell . <EOS>	89.87800981714653
<SOS> his hand of iron grasped , quick as lightning , firm as a pair of blacksmith 's pincers , the soldier 's throat . <EOS>	67.32141828036822
<SOS> he raised him , almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture , at the risk of flaying him in the passage . <EOS>	84.95130992655285
<SOS> he then laid him down on the floor , where d'artagnan , after giving him just time enough to draw his breath , gagged him with his long scarf ; and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle . <EOS>	106.77155481101141
<SOS> then the soldier , gagged and bound , was placed upon the hearth , the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends . <EOS>	44.047708541947735
<SOS> `` here 's a sword and a dress , '' said porthos . <EOS>	56.82411315063492
<SOS> `` i take them , '' said d'artagnan , `` for myself . <EOS>	55.50014865622302
<SOS> if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again . <EOS>	78.82472881605979
<SOS> stop ! <EOS>	89.28473513464336
<SOS> i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us . '' <EOS>	66.44598572163163
<SOS> `` i think , '' replied porthos , `` it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again ; it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way , and a failure would be ruinous . <EOS>	56.600312377562254
<SOS> no ; i will go down , seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged . '' <EOS>	76.86271439775093
<SOS> `` that is better , '' said the gascon . <EOS>	78.96304717850464
<SOS> `` be ready , '' said porthos , as he slipped through the opening . <EOS>	66.0446509956069
<SOS> he did as he said . <EOS>	67.11407443126201
<SOS> porthos seized his opportunity , caught the next soldier by his neck , gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room , and entered after him . <EOS>	92.8289344838668
<SOS> then they undressed him as they had done the first , laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bed the bedstead being of oak . <EOS>	103.3830556269913
<SOS> this operation proved as great a success as the first . <EOS>	51.841819008581325
<SOS> `` there , '' said d'artagnan , `` this is capital ! <EOS>	71.5156102361791
<SOS> now let me try on the dress of yonder chap . <EOS>	87.26667279296211
<SOS> porthos , i doubt if you can wear it ; but should it be too tight , never mind , you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers . '' <EOS>	82.18125825504347
<SOS> it happened , however , that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions , so , save that some few of the seams split , his uniform fitted porthos perfectly . <EOS>	63.184174590123774
<SOS> they then dressed themselves . <EOS>	89.22869752805475
<SOS> `` 't is done ! '' <EOS>	51.56442214837104
<SOS> they both exclaimed at once . <EOS>	56.9275382982717
<SOS> `` as to you , comrades , '' they said to the men , `` nothing will happen to you if you are discreet ; but if you stir you are dead men . '' <EOS>	42.462237999775716
<SOS> the soldiers were complaisant ; they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it . <EOS>	78.91459343466977
<SOS> `` now , '' said d'artagnan , `` you would n't be sorry to understand the plot , would you , porthos ? '' <EOS>	98.85421665495045
<SOS> `` well , no , not very . '' <EOS>	57.33735062345538
<SOS> `` well , then , we shall go down into the court . '' <EOS>	98.75865926988311
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	48.24383736250192
<SOS> `` we shall take the place of those two fellows . '' <EOS>	69.64804323642379
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	55.49765245207004
<SOS> `` we will walk back and forth . '' <EOS>	52.11901159311884
<SOS> `` that 's a good idea , for it is n't warm . '' <EOS>	75.31912688785033
<SOS> `` in a moment the valet de chambre will call the guard , as he did yesterday and the day before . '' <EOS>	97.99387403925921
<SOS> `` and we shall answer ? '' <EOS>	74.72154756680565
<SOS> `` no , on the contrary , we shall not answer . '' <EOS>	63.987029856694406
<SOS> `` as you please ; i do n't insist on answering . '' <EOS>	70.08146777701864
<SOS> `` we will not answer , then ; we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence . '' <EOS>	98.34419225747737

<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	78.46409638412082
<SOS> cried porthos , `` oh ! <EOS>	86.7923586134636
<SOS> i understand . '' <EOS>	72.06738135148983
<SOS> `` wait a little , porthos , before crying out ; for , on my word , you have n't reached the end , '' said the gascon , in a jesting tone . <EOS>	64.88251862609243
<SOS> `` what is to happen ? '' <EOS>	55.54117191442066
<SOS> said porthos . <EOS>	65.0210953562102
<SOS> `` follow me , '' replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	53.151148895537965
<SOS> `` the man who lives to see shall see . '' <EOS>	53.03202521888881
<SOS> and slipping through the aperture , he alighted in the court . <EOS>	74.81323698341544
<SOS> porthos followed him by the same road , but with more difficulty and less diligence . <EOS>	109.19630555030022
<SOS> they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear , as they lay bound in the chamber . <EOS>	78.69803073501714
<SOS> scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out : `` make ready ! '' <EOS>	71.14915906139527
<SOS> at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out : `` la bruyere and du barthois ! <EOS>	87.11506037387373
<SOS> march ! '' <EOS>	108.27740231480551
<SOS> `` it seems that i am named la bruyere , '' remarked d'artagnan . <EOS>	78.72620892866726
<SOS> `` and i , du barthois , '' added porthos . <EOS>	63.34965942523164
<SOS> `` where are you ? '' <EOS>	112.22212062244408
<SOS> asked the valet de chambre , whose eyes , dazzled by the light , could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom . <EOS>	91.58176619908
<SOS> `` here we are , '' said the gascon . <EOS>	66.76458363841294
<SOS> `` what say you to that , monsieur du vallon ? '' <EOS>	49.70292063859216
<SOS> he added in a low tone to porthos . <EOS>	73.72272668565537
<SOS> `` if it but lasts , most capital , '' responded porthos . <EOS>	80.77965956000465
<SOS> these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre , who opened the door of the vestibule , then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room , and showing them two stools : `` your orders are very simple , '' he said ; `` do n't allow anybody , except one person , to enter here . <EOS>	95.53142467307362
<SOS> do you hear not a single creature ! <EOS>	51.028793041655966
<SOS> obey that person implicitly . <EOS>	71.23698755297079
<SOS> on your return you can not make a mistake . <EOS>	85.29217325153499
<SOS> you have only to wait here till i release you . '' <EOS>	111.66764312818667
<SOS> d'artagnan was known to this valet de chambre , who was no other than bernouin , and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal . <EOS>	70.23507942044012
<SOS> the gascon , therefore , instead of answering , growled out `` ja ! <EOS>	52.81319448081964
<SOS> ja ! '' <EOS>	61.4643127490752
<SOS> in the most german and the least gascon accent possible . <EOS>	98.08650419876501
<SOS> as for porthos , on whom d'artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend , which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos , he was simply mute . <EOS>	79.97710727019735
<SOS> all that he was allowed to say , in case of emergencies , was the proverbial der teufel ! <EOS>	98.81968213370556
<SOS> bernouin shut the door and went away . <EOS>	74.67783396963159
<SOS> when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed , lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another . <EOS>	79.06342264288038
<SOS> `` porthos , my friend , '' said d'artagnan , `` do n't distrust providence ! <EOS>	87.7132036404168
<SOS> let me meditate and consider . '' <EOS>	53.616665812432124
<SOS> `` meditate and consider as much as you like , '' replied porthos , who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn . <EOS>	58.28424571263147
<SOS> `` we have walked eight paces , '' whispered d'artagnan , `` and gone up six steps , so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery . <EOS>	84.10566883145913
<SOS> the comte de la fere can not be far off , only the doors are locked . '' <EOS>	50.11135933959995
<SOS> `` that is a slight difficulty , '' said porthos , `` and a good push with the shoulders `` `` for god 's sake , porthos my friend , reserve your feats of strength , or they will not have , when needed , the honor they deserve . <EOS>	82.28857711549007

<SOS> `` oh , may god keep me from it , and you , too ! '' <EOS>	65.66631810852154
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	81.13093306241758
<SOS> `` the young king would , perhaps , show us some gratitude ; but the queen would never forgive us , and it is she whom we have to consider . <EOS>	71.88449386268857

<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	109.45300983738241
<SOS> said d'artagnan ; `` the some one is coming . '' <EOS>	101.57834983409894
<SOS> the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule . <EOS>	78.2398199534811
<SOS> the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier , wrapped in a brown cloak , with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes . <EOS>	85.3649188227332
<SOS> porthos effaced himself against the wall , but he could not render himself invisible ; and the man in the cloak said to him , giving him his lantern : `` light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling . '' <EOS>	55.68605329696739
<SOS> then addressing d'artagnan : `` you know the watchword ? '' <EOS>	89.08845995447709
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	89.20677537825891
<SOS> `` ja ! '' <EOS>	81.87564729800246
<SOS> replied the gascon , determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue . <EOS>	56.564750815212456
<SOS> `` tedesco ! '' <EOS>	80.11257575768197
<SOS> answered the cavalier ; `` va bene . '' <EOS>	56.64402089856996
<SOS> and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in , he opened it and disappeared behind it , shutting it as he went . <EOS>	62.20579449334575
<SOS> `` now , '' asked porthos , `` what are we to do ? '' <EOS>	59.02887845898681
<SOS> `` now we shall make use of your shoulder , friend porthos , if this door proves to be locked . <EOS>	54.93127481674476
<SOS> everything in its proper time , and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently . <EOS>	72.19615013678586
<SOS> but first barricade the first door well ; then we will follow yonder cavalier . '' <EOS>	70.40799936812098
<SOS> the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room , as not only to make the passage impassable , but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward . <EOS>	122.42182089607408
<SOS> `` there ! '' <EOS>	79.16274226224436
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` we ca n't be overtaken . <EOS>	82.96133718574522

<SOS> the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin . <EOS>	91.42135562046701
<SOS> at first , on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed , d'artagnan tried in vain to open it , but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels , which gave way , d'artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock . <EOS>	54.30226595062623
<SOS> the bolt gave way and the door opened . <EOS>	104.29644807087851
<SOS> `` as i told you , everything can be attained , porthos , women and doors , by proceeding with gentleness . '' <EOS>	66.77127090867268
<SOS> `` you 're a great moralist , and that 's the fact , '' said porthos . <EOS>	120.05291362574462
<SOS> they entered ; behind a glass window , by the light of the cardinal 's lantern , which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery , they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil , in long lines , forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys . <EOS>	54.805798265353914
<SOS> `` no cardinal ! '' <EOS>	73.10994281906802
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` but only his lantern ; where the devil , then , is he ? '' <EOS>	100.18271223986905
<SOS> exploring , however , one of the side wings of the gallery , after making a sign to porthos to explore the other , he saw , all at once , at his left , a tub containing an orange tree , which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture . <EOS>	59.3391793239201
<SOS> ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub , but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested . <EOS>	49.71696402412805
<SOS> d'artagnan , as we have said , perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase . <EOS>	57.05519728407977
<SOS> he called porthos to look at it . <EOS>	103.45807817802635
<SOS> `` were our object money only , '' he said , `` we should be rich directly . '' <EOS>	64.93231989657843
<SOS> `` how 's that ? '' <EOS>	71.04792156739343
<SOS> `` do n't you understand , porthos ? <EOS>	87.23737362545432
<SOS> at the bottom of that staircase lies , probably , the cardinal 's treasury of which folk tell such wonders , and we should only have to descend , empty a chest , shut the cardinal up in it , double lock it , go away , carrying off as much gold as we could , put back this orange tree over the place , and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal . '' <EOS>	100.5629681119634
<SOS> `` it would be a happy hit for clowns to make , but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen `` said porthos . <EOS>	94.94224687233157
<SOS> `` so i think ; and therefore i said , 'were our object money only ; ' but we want something else , '' replied the gascon . <EOS>	86.98360586161806
<SOS> at the same moment , whilst d'artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen , a metallic sound , as if some one was moving a bag of gold , struck on his ear ; he started ; instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase . <EOS>	51.981791192658676
<SOS> mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about , but he had with him a waxlight , to help him to explore his mysterious strong box . <EOS>	42.96238817371797
<SOS> `` faith , '' he said , in italian , as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals , `` faith , there 's enough to pay five councillors of parliament , and two generals in paris . <EOS>	54.592727908917716
<SOS> i am a great captain that i am ! <EOS>	61.1231764931997
<SOS> but i make war in my own way . '' <EOS>	92.68019127200677
<SOS> the two friends were crouching down , meantime , behind a tub in the side alley . <EOS>	69.07272432722101
<SOS> mazarin came within three steps of d'artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall ; the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place . <EOS>	69.81242139138378
<SOS> then the cardinal put out the waxlight , slipped it into his pocket , and taking up the lantern : `` now , '' he said , `` for monsieur de la fere . '' <EOS>	101.16632061696374
<SOS> `` very good , '' thought d'artagnan , `` 't is our road likewise ; we will go together . '' <EOS>	110.81637064912357
<SOS> all three set off on their walk , mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones . <EOS>	82.54942667042015
<SOS> the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed ; the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps . <EOS>	68.46225601991407
<SOS> he then turned to the left , down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends , but as he opened the door he paused , as if in thought . <EOS>	81.90173756194453
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	58.217644482237155
<SOS> diavolo ! '' <EOS>	63.00713792903978
<SOS> he exclaimed , `` i forgot the recommendation of de comminges , who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door , in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils . '' <EOS>	94.48169425612375
<SOS> and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps . <EOS>	103.18605935631693
<SOS> `` do not give yourself the trouble , my lord , '' said d'artagnan , with his right foot forward , his beaver in his hand , a smile on his face , `` we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are . '' <EOS>	48.368688649799864
<SOS> `` yes here we are , '' said porthos . <EOS>	95.03226812355497
<SOS> and he made the same friendly salute as d'artagnan . <EOS>	61.25683913846502
<SOS> mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare , recognized them , and let drop his lantern , uttering a cry of terror . <EOS>	90.54462231168229
<SOS> d'artagnan picked it up ; by good luck it had not been extinguished . <EOS>	95.01336510589245
<SOS> `` oh , what imprudence , my lord , '' said d'artagnan ; `` 't is not good to be about just here without a light . <EOS>	106.32247751625745
<SOS> your eminence might knock against something , or fall into a hole . '' <EOS>	96.46074869439025
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	65.38412189371024
<SOS> muttered mazarin , unable to recover from his astonishment . <EOS>	61.79245121994394
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , it is i. i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon , that excellent friend of mine , in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly . '' <EOS>	95.27585496948579
<SOS> and d'artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos , who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking . <EOS>	46.292792061416925
<SOS> `` you were going to visit monsieur de la fere ? '' <EOS>	79.49508086965793
<SOS> said d'artagnan . <EOS>	62.26902036258582
<SOS> `` do n't let us disarrange your eminence . <EOS>	95.06644167640982
<SOS> be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you . '' <EOS>	62.64323304252718
<SOS> mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses . <EOS>	62.89614286320015
<SOS> `` have you been long in the orangery ? '' <EOS>	51.8618542081128
<SOS> he asked in a trembling voice , remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury . <EOS>	85.41138313190076
<SOS> porthos opened his mouth to reply ; d'artagnan made him a sign , and his mouth , remaining silent , gradually closed . <EOS>	86.4423923914567
<SOS> `` this moment come , my lord , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	83.92744103781506
<SOS> mazarin breathed again . <EOS>	77.42682183460035
<SOS> his fears were now no longer for his hoard , but for himself . <EOS>	65.29937117388288
<SOS> a sort of smile played on his lips . <EOS>	84.52575741575033
<SOS> `` come , '' he said , `` you have me in a snare , gentlemen . <EOS>	82.53392911039
<SOS> i confess myself conquered . <EOS>	79.11848660555026

<SOS> `` oh , my lord ! '' <EOS>	119.2486006629098
<SOS> answered d'artagnan , `` you are too good ; as to our liberty , we have that ; we want to ask something else of you . '' <EOS>	86.38169301707134
<SOS> `` you have your liberty ? '' <EOS>	85.99200324187979
<SOS> repeated mazarin , in terror . <EOS>	49.79637652972091
<SOS> `` certainly ; and on the other hand , my lord , you have lost it , and now , in accordance with the law of war , sir , you must buy it back again . '' <EOS>	91.41051125889858
<SOS> mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart 's core . <EOS>	84.76067783723806
<SOS> his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos . <EOS>	68.04017689551783
<SOS> both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them . <EOS>	73.19518070968799
<SOS> `` to purchase back my liberty ? '' <EOS>	47.29222593403322
<SOS> said the cardinal . <EOS>	58.971574285068144
<SOS> `` yes , my lord . '' <EOS>	60.352354701011535
<SOS> `` and how much will that cost me , monsieur d'artagnan ? '' <EOS>	93.17054898048443
<SOS> `` zounds , my lord , i do n't know yet . <EOS>	73.95525491188423
<SOS> we must ask the comte de la fere the question . <EOS>	53.77824029848209
<SOS> will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count 's room , and in ten minutes all will be settled . '' <EOS>	75.56488943329396
<SOS> mazarin started . <EOS>	104.09842219261903
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect ; but i must warn you that we have no time to lose ; open the door then , my lord , and be so good as to remember , once for all , that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help , our position being very critical indeed , you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities . '' <EOS>	77.90210010141537
<SOS> `` be assured , '' answered mazarin , `` that i shall attempt nothing ; i give you my word of honor . '' <EOS>	47.819128469286305
<SOS> d'artagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness ; then turning to mazarin : `` now , my lord , let us enter , if you please . '' <EOS>	76.8624764327535

<SOS> conferences . <EOS>	119.11267984345707
<SOS> mazarin turned the lock of a double door , on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him . <EOS>	44.051692187486154
<SOS> on perceiving mazarin he bowed . <EOS>	88.68346302957569
<SOS> `` your eminence , '' he said , `` might have dispensed with your attendants ; the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it . '' <EOS>	61.293510186019674
<SOS> `` and so , my dear count , '' said d'artagnan , `` his eminence did n't actually insist on our attending him ; it is du vallon and i who have insisted , and even in a manner somewhat impolite , perhaps , so great was our longing to see you . '' <EOS>	82.53131266147923
<SOS> at that voice , that mocking tone , and that familiar gesture , accenting voice and tone , athos made a bound of surprise . <EOS>	60.06152307892155
<SOS> `` d'artagnan ! <EOS>	88.46276188926252

<SOS> `` what means this ? '' <EOS>	57.508995074074555
<SOS> asked the count . <EOS>	61.277688719033804
<SOS> `` it means , '' replied mazarin , trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt , `` that our parts are changed , and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs ; but , gentlemen , i warn you , unless you kill me , your victory will be of very short duration ; people will come to the rescue .

<SOS> `` i offered you your liberty , '' continued the minister ; `` will you take it ? <EOS>	61.73190772516466

<SOS> `` he is right , '' thought athos . <EOS>	93.19362601488275
<SOS> and , like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts , this feeling was expressed in his eyes . <EOS>	63.07948855338041
<SOS> `` and therefore , '' said d'artagnan , to clip the hope which athos 's tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin , `` we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity . '' <EOS>	79.9124030480736
<SOS> `` if on the contrary , '' resumed mazarin , `` you accept your liberty `` `` why you , my lord , might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward ; and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us . '' <EOS>	61.97359255116154
<SOS> `` no on the faith of a cardinal . <EOS>	53.193460402237626

<SOS> `` very willingly , if it be necessary to reassure you , '' answered the minister , and mazarin , who was delighted to get off so cheaply , led the way , in high spirits , to the corridor and opened the door . <EOS>	63.89282477380285

<SOS> `` the devil ! '' <EOS>	56.6420057406473
<SOS> exclaimed the gascon , `` 't is a dreadful night , my lord . <EOS>	82.8858510629073
<SOS> we do n't know the locality , and shall never find the wall . <EOS>	109.53377394550321
<SOS> since your eminence has come so far , come a few steps further ; conduct us , my lord , to the wall . '' <EOS>	67.74442506029682
<SOS> `` be it so , '' replied the cardinal ; and walking in a straight line he went to the wall , at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant . <EOS>	63.48513926493303
<SOS> `` are you satisfied , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	49.22029646325571
<SOS> asked mazarin . <EOS>	93.05912841751459
<SOS> `` i think so , indeed ; we should be hard to please if we were not . <EOS>	101.61453172271328

<SOS> three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church ! <EOS>	80.61011476503104

<SOS> apropos , my lord ! <EOS>	56.76620187817643
<SOS> you remarked that we were all active , vigorous and armed . '' <EOS>	54.77121895138512

<SOS> `` you are mistaken . <EOS>	104.30624438534248
<SOS> monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed . <EOS>	92.91389341530355
<SOS> the count is not ; and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves . '' <EOS>	67.09604911181982
<SOS> `` 't is true . '' <EOS>	56.86077670395259
<SOS> `` where can we find another sword ? '' <EOS>	89.79925658567433
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	57.673436184548045
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , `` will lend his , which is of no use to him , to the comte de la fere . '' <EOS>	86.68753850492176
<SOS> `` willingly , '' said the cardinal ; `` i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake . '' <EOS>	43.784511134972846
<SOS> `` i promise you , my lord , never to part with it , '' replied athos . <EOS>	90.20499484024523
<SOS> `` well , well , '' cried d'artagnan , `` this reconciliation is truly touching ; have you not tears in your eyes , porthos ? '' <EOS>	74.95120246904057
<SOS> `` yes , '' said porthos ; `` but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep ; i think it is the wind . '' <EOS>	76.79471986828311
<SOS> `` now climb up , athos , quickly , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	79.5871208280369
<SOS> athos , assisted by porthos , who lifted him up like a feather , arrived at the top . <EOS>	69.988668253607
<SOS> `` now , jump down , athos . '' <EOS>	60.469557616658506
<SOS> athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall . <EOS>	64.40007496749544
<SOS> `` are you on the ground ? '' <EOS>	81.68705128290686
<SOS> asked d'artagnan . <EOS>	63.949898209768016
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	91.75703174749894
<SOS> `` without accident ? '' <EOS>	74.1523005432832
<SOS> `` perfectly safe and sound . '' <EOS>	60.68209082796018
<SOS> `` porthos , whilst i get up , watch the cardinal . <EOS>	68.22411689084637
<SOS> no , i do n't want your help , watch the cardinal . '' <EOS>	88.82853944638411
<SOS> `` i am watching , '' said porthos . <EOS>	94.39331737431793
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	68.04071014052516
<SOS> `` you are right ; it is more difficult than i thought . <EOS>	100.1044827745921
<SOS> lend me your back but do n't let the cardinal go . '' <EOS>	52.1795925855022
<SOS> porthos lent him his back and d'artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall , where he seated himself . <EOS>	54.55268054466016
<SOS> mazarin pretended to laugh . <EOS>	89.7728837356477
<SOS> `` are you there ? '' <EOS>	71.15041886350842
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	78.54755832387643
<SOS> `` yes , my friend ; and now `` `` now , what ? '' <EOS>	70.73795695786036
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	63.20329873777613
<SOS> `` now give me the cardinal up here ; if he makes any noise stifle him . '' <EOS>	117.3539971229803
<SOS> mazarin wished to call out , but porthos held him tight and passed him to d'artagnan , who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him ; then in a menacing tone , he said : `` sir ! <EOS>	110.09255229022281
<SOS> jump directly down , close to monsieur de la fere , or , on the honor of a gentleman , i 'll kill you ! '' <EOS>	90.09179367174461
<SOS> `` monsieur , monsieur , '' cried mazarin , `` you are breaking your word to me ! '' <EOS>	68.43259314991253
<SOS> `` i did i promise you anything , my lord ? '' <EOS>	94.24646884086006
<SOS> mazarin groaned . <EOS>	50.13947922684123
<SOS> `` you are free , '' he said , `` through me ; your liberty was my ransom . '' <EOS>	54.094857160355424
<SOS> `` agreed ; but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery , to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall , which causes a tub to turn , revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little , my lord ? '' <EOS>	95.48492896368631
<SOS> `` diavolo ! '' <EOS>	55.21280611760447
<SOS> cried mazarin , almost choked , and clasping his hands ; `` i am a lost and ruined man ! '' <EOS>	67.54956381967672
<SOS> but without listening to his protestations of alarm , d'artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos , who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall . <EOS>	100.10217897583867
<SOS> porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall , and by the aid of his friend 's hand gained the summit . <EOS>	76.67809878787118
<SOS> `` i did n't understand it all , '' he said , `` but i understand now ; how droll it is ! '' <EOS>	94.87328322735556
<SOS> `` you think so ? <EOS>	69.31233306518449
<SOS> so much the better ; but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end , let us not lose time . '' <EOS>	75.39124575046205
<SOS> and he jumped off the wall . <EOS>	62.008646274281986
<SOS> porthos did the same . <EOS>	69.34969021478788
<SOS> `` attend to monsieur le cardinal , gentlemen , '' said d'artagnan ; `` for myself , i will reconnoitre . '' <EOS>	70.24482739051822
<SOS> the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard . <EOS>	44.90620834536288
<SOS> `` my lord , '' he said , `` which way do we go ? <EOS>	60.88635515231115
<SOS> think well of your reply , for should your eminence be mistaken , there might ensue most grave results for all of us . '' <EOS>	68.25761788356077
<SOS> `` along the wall , sir , '' said mazarin , `` there will be no danger of losing yourselves . '' <EOS>	105.17500704761044
<SOS> the three friends hastened on , but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace . <EOS>	61.62232529117778
<SOS> the cardinal could not keep up with them , though with every wish to do so . <EOS>	65.7949241651729
<SOS> suddenly d'artagnan touched something warm , which moved . <EOS>	113.76177860668854
<SOS> `` stop ! <EOS>	62.73811078572676
<SOS> a horse ! '' <EOS>	51.72063681200031
<SOS> he cried ; `` i have found a horse ! '' <EOS>	63.17196299056085
<SOS> `` and i , likewise , '' said athos . <EOS>	72.77862270522867
<SOS> `` i , too , '' said porthos , who , faithful to the instructions , still held the cardinal 's arm . <EOS>	40.867626420980315
<SOS> `` there 's luck , my lord ! <EOS>	48.28328068143973
<SOS> just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk . '' <EOS>	89.17990096958772
<SOS> but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced : `` touch it not ! '' <EOS>	69.66415786839848
<SOS> `` grimaud ! '' <EOS>	77.22513721286961
<SOS> he cried ; `` grimaud ! <EOS>	75.4816832889305
<SOS> what art thou about ? <EOS>	69.72243206697244
<SOS> why , thou art posted here by heaven ! '' <EOS>	105.72377203950293
<SOS> `` no , sir , '' said the honest servant , `` it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses . '' <EOS>	64.20995085041383
<SOS> `` is aramis here ? '' <EOS>	57.07188931144512
<SOS> `` yes , sir ; he has been here since yesterday . '' <EOS>	65.49766550554953
<SOS> `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	90.28533091797821
<SOS> `` on the watch `` `` what ! <EOS>	75.12503492495361
<SOS> aramis here ? '' <EOS>	63.560848615316225
<SOS> cried athos . <EOS>	94.07063437435286
<SOS> `` at the lesser gate of the castle ; he 's posted there . '' <EOS>	87.90876897121244
<SOS> `` are you a large party ? '' <EOS>	113.41015161225707
<SOS> `` sixty . '' <EOS>	104.71440218451984
<SOS> `` let him know . '' <EOS>	58.64930882657194
<SOS> `` this moment , sir . '' <EOS>	91.70002083519171
<SOS> and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself , grimaud set off at full speed ; whilst , enchanted at being all together again , the friends awaited his return . <EOS>	59.12462414817025
<SOS> there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin . <EOS>	76.87627804971284
<SOS> chapter lxxxvii . <EOS>	66.1311205105874
<SOS> thinking that porthos will be at last a baron , and d'artagnan a captain . <EOS>	81.36108515780482
<SOS> at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived , accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers . <EOS>	63.577656288070145
<SOS> he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends ' arms . <EOS>	78.67548151489144
<SOS> `` you are free , my brothers ! <EOS>	85.13774640948883
<SOS> free without my aid ! <EOS>	65.95752484937194
<SOS> and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts . '' <EOS>	95.83441591081655
<SOS> `` do not be unhappy , dear friend , on that account ; if you have done nothing as yet , you will do something soon , '' replied athos . <EOS>	84.03288562274935
<SOS> `` i had well concerted my plans , '' pursued aramis ; `` the coadjutor gave me sixty men ; twenty guard the walls of the park , twenty the road from rueil to saint germain , twenty are dispersed in the woods . <EOS>	65.85356993668661
<SOS> thus i was able , thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces , to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen . '' <EOS>	104.91284561296455
<SOS> mazarin listened intently . <EOS>	120.7318677416783
<SOS> `` but , '' said d'artagnan , `` i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ! '' <EOS>	81.29205836106087
<SOS> `` ah , yes ! '' <EOS>	63.62250040361753
<SOS> said aramis , `` toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment ! <EOS>	81.02971099100566
<SOS> in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money . <EOS>	73.62650179893645
<SOS> in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun , since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure . <EOS>	77.41687514249432
<SOS> you can understand , dear friend , with what hope i was inspired by that last letter . <EOS>	90.13420584448446
<SOS> i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men ; i encircled the castle ; the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out , which i did not expect till to morrow , and i did n't hope to free you without a skirmish . <EOS>	88.82228288462002
<SOS> you are free to night , without fighting ; so much the better ! <EOS>	51.169695177749226
<SOS> how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin ? <EOS>	62.539999394088476
<SOS> you must have much reason to complain of him . '' <EOS>	79.57660975480985
<SOS> `` not very much , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.94990173224624
<SOS> `` really ! '' <EOS>	59.142770534362235
<SOS> `` i might even say that we have some reason to praise him . '' <EOS>	77.27184868497861
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	62.51189478854741
<SOS> `` yes , really ; it is owing to him that we are free . '' <EOS>	81.97913150408796
<SOS> `` owing to him ? '' <EOS>	72.42660182532599
<SOS> `` yes , he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin , his valet de chambre , and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere . <EOS>	89.96259241398101
<SOS> then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it . <EOS>	68.21756322411721
<SOS> he even went so far as to show us the way out ; he led us to the park wall , which we climbed over without accident , and then we fell in with grimaud . '' <EOS>	63.275887278834794
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	57.37685803517375
<SOS> exclaimed aramis , `` this will reconcile me to him ; but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act . '' <EOS>	69.11651733026343
<SOS> `` my lord , '' said d'artagnan , no longer able to contain himself , `` allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d'herblay , who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence . '' <EOS>	99.80201841667113
<SOS> and he retired , discovering mazarin , who was in great confusion , to the astonished gaze of aramis . <EOS>	93.2859580312646
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	70.57303548909776
<SOS> ho ! '' <EOS>	66.8467435799366
<SOS> exclaimed the latter , `` the cardinal ! <EOS>	51.756285873158824

<SOS> to horse ! '' <EOS>	85.50599321858536
<SOS> several horsemen ran quickly to him . <EOS>	55.04471665129141
<SOS> `` zounds ! '' <EOS>	98.87550165797276
<SOS> cried aramis , `` i may have done some good ; so , my lord , deign to receive my most respectful homage ! <EOS>	56.301604963687545

<SOS> apropos ! <EOS>	41.008558846695806
<SOS> i forgot `` and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen . <EOS>	57.550099609937625
<SOS> `` i think it will be wise to set off , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	43.05052940708626
<SOS> `` yes ; but i am expecting some one , a friend of athos . '' <EOS>	67.07050939303257
<SOS> `` a friend ! '' <EOS>	70.2815676289295
<SOS> exclaimed the count . <EOS>	96.79260803343625
<SOS> `` and here he comes , by jupiter ! <EOS>	52.556707351520494
<SOS> galloping through the bushes . '' <EOS>	62.99733907315256
<SOS> `` the count ! <EOS>	77.68980508832641
<SOS> the count ! '' <EOS>	91.4000337883874
<SOS> cried a young voice that made athos start . <EOS>	51.67690116554818
<SOS> `` raoul ! <EOS>	92.26516590450935
<SOS> raoul ! '' <EOS>	67.94984741600669
<SOS> he ejaculated . <EOS>	82.82119186864212
<SOS> for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father 's neck . <EOS>	78.8554985184333
<SOS> `` look , my lord cardinal , '' said aramis , `` would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love ? <EOS>	57.33322723544114
<SOS> gentlemen , '' he continued , addressing the cavaliers , who became more and more numerous every instant ; `` gentlemen , encircle his eminence , that you may show him the greater honor . <EOS>	64.26240318231275
<SOS> he will , indeed give us the favor of his company ; you will , i hope , be grateful for it ; porthos , do not lose sight of his eminence . '' <EOS>	96.0135831836576
<SOS> aramis then joined athos and d'artagnan , who were consulting together . <EOS>	66.66234282019168
<SOS> `` come , '' said d'artagnan , after a conference of five minutes ' duration , `` let us begin our journey . '' <EOS>	54.57182363622582
<SOS> `` where are we to go ? '' <EOS>	59.20057118364305
<SOS> asked porthos . <EOS>	102.08499342021646
<SOS> `` to your house , dear porthos , at pierrefonds ; your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence ; it is , likewise , well situated neither too near paris , nor too far from it ; we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility . <EOS>	75.49693628937844
<SOS> come , my lord , you shall be treated like a prince , as you are . '' <EOS>	64.12489452952623
<SOS> `` a fallen prince ! '' <EOS>	59.93940498894792
<SOS> exclaimed mazarin , piteously . <EOS>	86.71954767325836
<SOS> `` the chances of war , '' said athos , `` are many , but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them . '' <EOS>	68.26316547516097
<SOS> `` no , but we shall make use of them , '' said d'artagnan . <EOS>	61.91631445518985
<SOS> the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days . <EOS>	72.58987852221149
<SOS> mazarin , still sombre and pensive , permitted himself to be dragged along in this way ; it looked a race of phantoms . <EOS>	67.50587111080604
<SOS> at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein ; half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down . <EOS>	54.351967633298926
<SOS> `` horses , nowadays , are not what they were formerly , '' observed porthos ; `` everything degenerates . '' <EOS>	63.474334647475935
<SOS> `` i have sent grimaud to dammartin , '' said aramis . <EOS>	101.45431721402463
<SOS> `` he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence , four for us . <EOS>	93.5806203439909
<SOS> we , at least , must keep close to monseigneur ; the rest of the start will rejoin us later . <EOS>	96.59771420320585
<SOS> once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear . '' <EOS>	66.87116732601677
<SOS> grimaud , in fact , brought back five horses . <EOS>	67.5093684706794
<SOS> the nobleman to whom he applied , being a friend of porthos , was very ready , not to sell them , as was proposed , but to lend them . <EOS>	51.83650302045627
<SOS> ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville , but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor , guarding mazarin carefully . <EOS>	53.63201544783955
<SOS> at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds . <EOS>	70.01191830896268
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	69.66436914139433
<SOS> said mousqueton , who had ridden by the side of d'artagnan without speaking a word on the journey , `` you may think what you will , sir , but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds ; '' and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends . <EOS>	90.46542445668537
<SOS> `` we are four of us , '' said d'artagnan ; `` we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time . <EOS>	87.21456871771865
<SOS> athos is going to examine the castle , which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege ; porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison . <EOS>	75.75738070923798
<SOS> that is to say , athos will be chief engineer , porthos purveyor in general , and aramis governor of the fortress . '' <EOS>	62.58613763068083
<SOS> meanwhile , they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau . <EOS>	81.36701680509954
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , when he was in his room , `` you do not expect , i presume , to keep me here a long time incognito ? '' <EOS>	53.21521916056547
<SOS> `` no , my lord , '' replied the gascon ; `` on the contrary , we think of announcing very soon that we have you here . '' <EOS>	80.21402883234599

<SOS> `` defend ourselves . <EOS>	110.22234626528821

<SOS> `` speak , then , chevalier ! '' <EOS>	104.27816499272659

<SOS> `` as for me , '' replied aramis , `` i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you . <EOS>	75.78723529556194

<SOS> the demands in that programme must be granted . '' <EOS>	60.62721862452239
<SOS> `` we were almost agreed on those , '' replied mazarin ; `` let us pass on to private and personal stipulations . '' <EOS>	53.961768634533755
<SOS> `` you suppose , then , that there are some ? '' <EOS>	47.246510920037686
<SOS> said aramis , smiling . <EOS>	96.24423828585566
<SOS> `` i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere , '' replied the cardinal , bowing to athos . <EOS>	90.88769404352122
<SOS> `` my lord , you are right , and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last . <EOS>	53.10790909530742

<SOS> he is a proud soul he is a man by himself ! <EOS>	79.65081655382501
<SOS> you are right he is worth us all , and we avow it to you ! '' <EOS>	90.77989363391403
<SOS> `` aramis , '' said athos , `` are you jesting ? '' <EOS>	62.86876608785762
<SOS> `` no , no , dear friend ; i state only what we all know . <EOS>	70.4567766816919
<SOS> you are right ; it is not you alone this matter concerns , but my lord and his unworthy servant , myself . '' <EOS>	47.517335694375504
<SOS> `` well , then , what do you require besides the general conditions before recited ? '' <EOS>	55.24548257578562
<SOS> `` i require , my lord , that normandy should be given to madame de longueville , with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution . <EOS>	76.23884552878908
<SOS> i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne ; and that my lord , after having been present at the christening , should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope . '' <EOS>	57.472542409637825
<SOS> `` that is , you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions , to quit france and be an exile . '' <EOS>	85.82757501099725
<SOS> `` i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity , allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends . '' <EOS>	41.92374088741264
<SOS> mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable , and then turned to d'artagnan . <EOS>	99.5857522760566
<SOS> `` and you , sir ? '' <EOS>	91.34968755646146
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	78.32646006722487
<SOS> `` i , my lord , '' answered the gascon , `` i differ from monsieur d'herblay entirely as to the last point , though i agree with him on the first . <EOS>	79.70516662700805
<SOS> far from wishing my lord to quit paris , i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister , as he is a great statesman . <EOS>	86.98622970443849
<SOS> i shall try also to help him to down the fronde , but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king 's faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name . <EOS>	87.00386745482469
<SOS> and you , monsieur du vallon `` `` yes , you , sir ! <EOS>	64.6745166741787
<SOS> speak , if you please , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	88.18418148193699
<SOS> `` as for me , '' answered porthos , `` i wish my lord cardinal , in order to do honor to my house , which gives him an asylum , would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony , with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends , whenever his majesty next creates peers . '' <EOS>	94.4093766634046
<SOS> `` you know , sir , that before receiving the order one must submit proofs . '' <EOS>	102.24351923526196
<SOS> `` my friends will submit them . <EOS>	57.589007778233096
<SOS> besides , should it be necessary , monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided . '' <EOS>	76.77985892149205
<SOS> mazarin bit his lips ; the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly : `` all this appears to me to be ill conceived , disjointed , gentlemen ; for if i satisfy some i shall displease others . <EOS>	87.4541961092489
<SOS> if i stay in paris i can not go to rome ; if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister ; and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d'artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron . '' <EOS>	90.43806594687587
<SOS> `` true , '' said aramis , `` so , as i am in a minority , i withdraw my proposition , so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur 's resignation . '' <EOS>	97.99718197228198
<SOS> `` i am to remain minister , then ? '' <EOS>	68.49218063817345
<SOS> said mazarin . <EOS>	60.95128355942755
<SOS> `` you remain minister ; that is understood , '' said d'artagnan ; `` france needs you . '' <EOS>	78.49331205101936
<SOS> `` and i desist from my pretensions , '' said aramis . <EOS>	51.967990511138446
<SOS> `` his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty 's favorite , if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves . '' <EOS>	57.13528001800063
<SOS> `` occupy yourselves with your own affairs , gentlemen , and let france settle matters as she will with me , '' resumed mazarin . <EOS>	64.12630654470667
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	68.45272230415986
<SOS> ho ! '' <EOS>	90.01178943675501
<SOS> replied aramis . <EOS>	61.59531297413972
<SOS> `` the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us , promising at the same time to obtain the queen 's consent to it . '' <EOS>	77.72996100174919
<SOS> `` i can answer only for myself , '' said mazarin . <EOS>	75.64905224362363
<SOS> `` i can not answer for the queen . <EOS>	91.28225483016026

<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	80.259467313058
<SOS> said d'artagnan , `` monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing . '' <EOS>	98.88392153061555
<SOS> `` here , monseigneur , '' said aramis , `` is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs . <EOS>	51.617002971594125
<SOS> will your eminence please read and examine ? '' <EOS>	56.74869598545106
<SOS> `` i am acquainted with it . '' <EOS>	65.69088732815449
<SOS> `` sign it , then . '' <EOS>	76.2859152763118
<SOS> `` reflect , gentlemen , that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence . '' <EOS>	69.53466544320256
<SOS> `` monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given . '' <EOS>	77.50246659504394
<SOS> `` suppose i refuse ? '' <EOS>	65.80773280233429
<SOS> `` then , '' said d'artagnan , `` your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal . '' <EOS>	93.13047579263785
<SOS> `` would you dare to touch a cardinal ? '' <EOS>	67.35616098219023
<SOS> `` you have dared , my lord , to imprison her majesty 's musketeers . '' <EOS>	56.16609737221135
<SOS> `` the queen will revenge me , gentlemen . '' <EOS>	79.83803154637242
<SOS> `` i do not think so , although inclination might lead her to do so , but we shall take your eminence to paris , and the parisians will defend us . '' <EOS>	94.35092779789646
<SOS> `` how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain , '' said aramis . <EOS>	80.20056119601975
<SOS> `` how they must be asking , 'where is the cardinal ? ' <EOS>	77.06316470845272
<SOS> 'what has become of the minister ? ' <EOS>	64.5900893056463
<SOS> 'where has the favorite gone ? ' <EOS>	85.30799514217148
<SOS> how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners ! <EOS>	111.15624935670638
<SOS> what comments must be made ; and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared , how the fronde must triumph ! '' <EOS>	72.08459763436406
<SOS> `` it is frightful , '' murmured mazarin . <EOS>	64.33860645828197
<SOS> `` sign the treaty , then , monseigneur , '' said aramis . <EOS>	74.27625881582065
<SOS> `` suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ? '' <EOS>	88.54679541552493
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	79.19750627137206
<SOS> nonsense ! '' <EOS>	44.6356238901158
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well ; i know an excellent method . '' <EOS>	61.40635442509558
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	123.9847376462895
<SOS> `` i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted . '' <EOS>	93.67855141305189
<SOS> `` and then ? '' <EOS>	89.57888275129562
<SOS> asked mazarin , turning pale . <EOS>	82.4220806594757
<SOS> `` when i see her majesty embarrassed , i shall conduct her to rueil , make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box . '' <EOS>	62.76018770252824
<SOS> `` enough , sir , '' muttered the cardinal , `` you have said enough ; where is the treaty ? '' <EOS>	71.10350544003958
<SOS> `` here it is , '' replied aramis . <EOS>	93.85516897835709
<SOS> `` sign , my lord , '' and he gave him a pen . <EOS>	85.39457035539135
<SOS> mazarin arose , walked some moments , thoughtful , but not dejected . <EOS>	104.47297189471917
<SOS> `` and when i have signed , '' he said , `` what is to be my guarantee ? '' <EOS>	81.04242702012209
<SOS> `` my word of honor , sir , '' said athos . <EOS>	85.69200552857092
<SOS> mazarin started , turned toward the comte de la fere , and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance , took the pen . <EOS>	96.957307152612
<SOS> `` it is sufficient , count , '' he said , and signed the treaty . <EOS>	70.40288519924074
<SOS> `` and now , monsieur d'artagnan , '' he said , `` prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen . '' <EOS>	116.89862770178522
<SOS> chapter lxxxviii . <EOS>	84.02696424221106
<SOS> shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword . <EOS>	46.91862515242088
<SOS> d'artagnan knew his part well ; he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it . <EOS>	55.060833218753885
<SOS> he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling , by sending relays of horses to chantilly , so that he might be in paris in five or six hours . <EOS>	52.11369306252524
<SOS> but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament , since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him . <EOS>	77.24072163798975
<SOS> `` in fact , '' he said , as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission , `` athos , for generosity , is a hero of romance ; porthos has an excellent disposition , but is easily influenced ; aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance , always illegible . <EOS>	65.12294518161234
<SOS> what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them ? <EOS>	79.23867195991382
<SOS> the deliverance of the cardinal , perhaps . <EOS>	73.39044815462789
<SOS> now , the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes ; and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean . '' <EOS>	118.41355062396794
<SOS> he went to find aramis . <EOS>	53.60153147278548
<SOS> `` you , my dear chevalier d'herblay , '' he said , `` are the fronde incarnate . <EOS>	53.01242955544006
<SOS> mistrust athos , therefore , who will not prosecute the affairs of any one , even his own . <EOS>	74.49904472304705
<SOS> mistrust porthos , especially , who , to please the count whom he regards as god on earth , will assist him in contriving mazarin 's escape , if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric . '' <EOS>	54.19186292571903
<SOS> aramis smiled ; his smile was at once cunning and resolute . <EOS>	56.12326928223373
<SOS> `` fear nothing , '' he said ; `` i have my conditions to impose . <EOS>	78.16603523059291
<SOS> my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side . '' <EOS>	54.808244395237196
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	75.52380669955502
<SOS> thought d'artagnan : `` in this direction i am satisfied . '' <EOS>	45.589147423193864
<SOS> he pressed aramis 's hand and went in search of porthos . <EOS>	67.77811949890324
<SOS> `` friend , '' he said , `` you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune , that , at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours , it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis , whose cunning you know a cunning which , we may say between ourselves , is not always without egotism ; or by athos , a noble and disinterested man , but blase , who , desiring nothing further for himself , does n't sympathize with the desires of others . <EOS>	61.68606813084659
<SOS> what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go ? '' <EOS>	56.40570937926492
<SOS> `` why , i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily . '' <EOS>	106.76465554291948
<SOS> `` bravo , porthos ! <EOS>	103.86866889313657
<SOS> and you would be right , my friend ; for in losing him you would lose your barony , which you have in your grasp , to say nothing of the fact that , were he once out of this , mazarin would have you hanged . '' <EOS>	55.436897704534346
<SOS> `` do you think so ? '' <EOS>	95.04406425226374
<SOS> `` i am sure of it . '' <EOS>	67.765114448651
<SOS> `` then i would kill him rather than let him go . '' <EOS>	91.77870260819286
<SOS> `` and you would act rightly . <EOS>	73.27340542253559
<SOS> there is no question , you understand , provided we secure our own interests , of securing those of the frondeurs ; who , besides , do n't understand political matters as we old soldiers do . '' <EOS>	67.39259583631126
<SOS> `` never fear , dear friend , '' said porthos . <EOS>	94.54696208041481
<SOS> `` i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse ; i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight ; then i shall place myself at the cardinal 's door a door with glass windows . <EOS>	71.17125688855718
<SOS> i shall see everything , and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate . '' <EOS>	103.90280359023781
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	44.34533284004444
<SOS> thought d'artagnan ; `` on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded . '' <EOS>	58.69435621933656
<SOS> he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos . <EOS>	106.1974808157716
<SOS> `` my dear athos , '' he said , `` i am going away . <EOS>	57.3173117831218
<SOS> i have only one thing to say to you . <EOS>	61.078908519543496
<SOS> you know anne of austria ; the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life ; if you let him go i am a dead man . '' <EOS>	42.200523624232815
<SOS> `` i needed nothing less than that consideration , my dear d'artagnan , to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer . <EOS>	71.06485168805604
<SOS> i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him . '' <EOS>	83.70773363761438
<SOS> `` this reassures me more than all the royal signatures , '' thought d'artagnan . <EOS>	52.20305010410456
<SOS> `` now that i have the word of athos i can set out . '' <EOS>	69.13418394969909
<SOS> d'artagnan started alone on his journey , without other escort than his sword , and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen 's presence . <EOS>	92.16803097857463
<SOS> six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain . <EOS>	74.74075193003247
<SOS> the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known . <EOS>	109.16861606945982
<SOS> anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one . <EOS>	101.60082909063283
<SOS> in the chamber of d'artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged . <EOS>	71.57876011731409
<SOS> on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could , of course , tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized , stripped and bound . <EOS>	61.591532475105446
<SOS> but as to what had been done by porthos and d'artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau . <EOS>	109.01009396749004
<SOS> bernouin alone knew a little more than the others . <EOS>	71.85419787731993
<SOS> bernouin , seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight , had made an examination of the orangery . <EOS>	48.080151860848495
<SOS> the first door , barricaded with furniture , had aroused in him certain suspicions , but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion . <EOS>	65.79080729858869
<SOS> then he came to the corridor , all the doors of which he found open ; so , too , was the door of athos 's chamber and that of the park . <EOS>	61.34519422660623
<SOS> from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow . <EOS>	75.6008244803552
<SOS> he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall ; on the other side he found similar tracks , then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien . <EOS>	54.41513709773038
<SOS> he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners , since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time ; and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance . <EOS>	96.54403847606407
<SOS> anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de condé , who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil , in whatsoever direction it might be . <EOS>	116.42905639841653
<SOS> now , since d'artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen , since he was alone , since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain , no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way . <EOS>	77.32093259395205
<SOS> on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person , who , standing on the threshold , awaited news of his vanished master . <EOS>	72.48021483890376
<SOS> at the sight of d'artagnan , who entered the courtyard on horseback , bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken . <EOS>	97.03372892212239
<SOS> but d'artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head , dismounted , and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing , he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips . <EOS>	69.75482547261134
<SOS> `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	74.43452319834826
<SOS> cried the latter , like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep , `` monsieur d'artagnan ! '' <EOS>	95.9892705053491
<SOS> `` himself , monsieur bernouin . '' <EOS>	61.98634940910961
<SOS> `` and why have you come here ? '' <EOS>	84.30098730146412
<SOS> `` to bring news of monsieur de mazarin the freshest news there is . '' <EOS>	75.46310964031932
<SOS> `` what has become of him , then ? '' <EOS>	77.37243226565896
<SOS> `` he is as well as you and i . '' <EOS>	56.746687137255506
<SOS> `` nothing bad has happened to him , then ? '' <EOS>	72.0155653070205
<SOS> `` absolutely nothing . <EOS>	68.47312135703932
<SOS> he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france , and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him . <EOS>	74.21118090378131
<SOS> we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort . <EOS>	53.304153409807256
<SOS> we set out last evening and here we are . '' <EOS>	59.84436793229408
<SOS> `` here you are . '' <EOS>	89.14604180513561
<SOS> `` his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty , something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain . <EOS>	70.20604709008587
<SOS> and therefore , my dear monsieur bernouin , if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master , announce to her majesty that i have come , and tell her with what purpose . '' <EOS>	82.99756904396322
<SOS> whether he spoke seriously or in jest , since it was evident that under existing circumstances d'artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen 's uneasiness , bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy ; and as he had foreseen , the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d'artagnan at once . <EOS>	103.17483759404486
<SOS> d'artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect , and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal 's letter it was , however , merely a letter of introduction . <EOS>	63.29089815574853
<SOS> the queen read it , recognized the writing , and , since there were no details in it of what had occurred , asked for particulars . <EOS>	108.61308436963627
<SOS> d'artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions . <EOS>	89.95630763825534
<SOS> the queen , as he went on , looked at him with increasing astonishment . <EOS>	84.2452083317723
<SOS> she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him . <EOS>	65.65160843127498
<SOS> `` how , sir ! '' <EOS>	54.86964546683978
<SOS> she cried , as d'artagnan finished , `` you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason ! '' <EOS>	94.56143430653385
<SOS> `` pardon , madame , but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me . <EOS>	65.13150656582422
<SOS> there is here no question of crime or treason . <EOS>	54.92459197292113
<SOS> monsieur de mazarin held us in prison , monsieur du vallon and myself , because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i. , brother in law of the late king , your husband , the consort of madame henrietta , your sister and your guest , and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr . <EOS>	64.65780857555319
<SOS> we were then convinced , my friend and i , that there was some error of which we were the victims , and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves . <EOS>	87.67374473059482
<SOS> now , that an explanation may bear fruit , it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted , far from noise and interruption . <EOS>	74.62178518685677
<SOS> we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend 's chateau and there we have come to an understanding . <EOS>	72.06770270349932
<SOS> well , madame , it proved to be as we had supposed ; there was a mistake . <EOS>	79.13697275361042
<SOS> monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell , instead of king charles , which would have been a disgrace , rebounding from us to him , and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son . <EOS>	62.241759175214895
<SOS> we were able to prove the contrary , and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty , calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre , where your royal munificence has provided for her a home . <EOS>	88.64123748278634
<SOS> that proof satisfied him so completely that , as a sign of satisfaction , he has sent me , as your majesty may see , to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted . '' <EOS>	90.46441731335622
<SOS> `` i listen to you , and i wonder at you , sir , '' said the queen . <EOS>	119.6017579737276
<SOS> `` in fact , i have rarely seen such excess of impudence . '' <EOS>	76.0357094145337
<SOS> `` your majesty , on your side , '' said d'artagnan , `` is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been . '' <EOS>	65.54611602154077
<SOS> `` you are in error , sir , '' answered the queen . <EOS>	93.32527252448166
<SOS> `` i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested , and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister . '' <EOS>	61.47239471111786
<SOS> `` i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence , first , because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results . <EOS>	68.1243823411926
<SOS> before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead ; and indeed , so convinced is he of this , that he entreated me , should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way , to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution . '' <EOS>	82.13437189410278
<SOS> `` well , then , i will content myself with arresting you ! '' <EOS>	61.09226513858265
<SOS> `` madame , the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen , and should i not have returned by to morrow , at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament . '' <EOS>	42.87138588063775
<SOS> `` it is evident , sir , that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs ; otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times ; that he has there met de beaufort , de bouillon , the coadjutor and d'elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him . '' <EOS>	86.52621535060806
<SOS> `` your pardon , madame , i know all that . <EOS>	88.24636613567421
<SOS> and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort , nor to de bouillon , nor to the coadjutor , nor to d'elbeuf . <EOS>	79.48472477014468
<SOS> these gentlemen wage war on private account , and in buying them up , by granting them what they wished , monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain . <EOS>	79.79205731443707
<SOS> he will be delivered to the parliament , members of which can , of course , be bought , but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body . '' <EOS>	108.21240101577706
<SOS> `` i think , '' returned anne of austria , fixing upon him a glance , which in any woman 's face would have expressed disdain , but in a queen 's , spread terror to those she looked upon , `` nay , i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign . '' <EOS>	76.40594863830313
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied d'artagnan , `` i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so . <EOS>	115.87744013515245
<SOS> believe me , madame , as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives ; that we have , as you well know good heaven ! <EOS>	52.212213647855776
<SOS> risked our lives twenty times for your majesty . <EOS>	72.41105140359345
<SOS> have you , then , madame , no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity , without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you ? <EOS>	73.05372593878451
<SOS> look at me , madame at me , whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly . <EOS>	39.13024148195941
<SOS> what am i ? <EOS>	68.08546892721431
<SOS> a poor officer , without fortune , without protection , without a future , unless the eye of my queen , which i have sought so long , rests on me for a moment . <EOS>	75.39851856624212
<SOS> look at the comte de la fere , a type of nobility , a flower of chivalry . <EOS>	56.26716767484815
<SOS> he has taken part against his queen , or rather , against her minister . <EOS>	119.40065470370803
<SOS> he has not been unreasonably exacting , it seems to me . <EOS>	57.11987936545338
<SOS> look at monsieur du vallon , that faithful soul , that arm of steel , who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage . <EOS>	66.91864714582569
<SOS> consider , in short , your people who love you and who yet are famished , who have no other wish than to bless you , and who , nevertheless no , i am wrong , your subjects , madame , will never curse you ; say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war , joy tears , and happiness to misfortune ! '' <EOS>	111.58199628144258
<SOS> anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d'artagnan , which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling . <EOS>	52.072894899632665
<SOS> `` why did you not say all this before you took action , sir ? '' <EOS>	69.88288128405793
<SOS> she said . <EOS>	85.22214590273062
<SOS> `` because , madame , it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is , that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands . '' <EOS>	47.27351795930898
<SOS> `` and that valor would shrink from no undertaking , according to what i see . '' <EOS>	91.34700916523137
<SOS> `` it has hesitated at nothing in the past ; why , then , should it be less daring in the future ? '' <EOS>	60.82372510377758
<SOS> `` then , in case of my refusal , this valor , should a struggle occur , will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court , to deliver me into the hands of the fronde , as you propose to deliver my minister ? '' <EOS>	94.00628868758722
<SOS> `` we have not thought about it yet , madame , '' answered d'artagnan , with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete ; `` but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly . '' <EOS>	89.8739371073026
<SOS> `` i ought , '' muttered anne to herself , `` by this time to remember that these men are giants . '' <EOS>	59.12566097721172
<SOS> `` alas , madame ! '' <EOS>	99.05201439791219
<SOS> exclaimed d'artagnan , `` this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us . '' <EOS>	53.58327386219931
<SOS> `` perhaps , '' said anne ; `` but that idea , if at last i have it `` `` your majesty will do us justice . <EOS>	78.21975986642047
<SOS> in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp . <EOS>	92.3200150885713
<SOS> you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign . '' <EOS>	66.99799449700865
<SOS> `` where is the treaty ? '' <EOS>	76.01801382458461
<SOS> `` here it is . '' <EOS>	115.57742722242567
<SOS> anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d'artagnan presented to her . <EOS>	68.30173062640426
<SOS> `` i do not see here , '' she said , `` anything but general conditions ; the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort , de bouillon and d'elbeuf and of the coadjutor , are herein consulted ; but with regard to yours ? '' <EOS>	75.35724533640413
<SOS> `` we do ourselves justice , madame , even in assuming the high position that we have . <EOS>	60.062625528356556
<SOS> we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names . '' <EOS>	78.54727620580289
<SOS> `` but you , i presume , have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce ? '' <EOS>	73.28528716783433
<SOS> `` i believe you , madame , to be a great and powerful queen , and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain . '' <EOS>	104.38537824500636
<SOS> `` it is my intention so to do ; come , let us hear you . <EOS>	81.01258735625228
<SOS> speak . '' <EOS>	76.79912682625145
<SOS> `` he who has negotiated these matters ( forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself , but i must claim that importance which has been given to me , not assumed by me ) he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal , ought , it appears to me , in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty , to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers .

<SOS> `` you have an answer ready for everything , '' replied the queen , and she took from her bureau a document , which she filled up and signed . <EOS>	97.95746200875809
<SOS> `` undoubtedly , madame , '' said d'artagnan , taking the document and bowing , `` this is a noble reward ; but everything in the world is unstable , and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow . '' <EOS>	79.6306458039258
<SOS> `` what more do you want ? '' <EOS>	50.93683265518387
<SOS> asked the queen , coloring , as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own . <EOS>	90.98208544764707
<SOS> `` a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers , to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty . '' <EOS>	61.425843977567375
<SOS> anne hesitated . <EOS>	74.74014439658895
<SOS> `` to think of the parisians , '' soliloquized d'artagnan , `` offering only the other day , by an edict of the parliament , six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them , dead or alive if alive , in order to hang him ; if dead , to deny him the rites of christian burial !

<SOS> `` come , '' said anne , `` 't is reasonable , since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed ; '' and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs . <EOS>	53.51277201500423

<SOS> here are the august signatures of your majesty 's hand ; if you think you are right in giving them to me , you shall do so , but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them . '' <EOS>	46.265574789779194
<SOS> and d'artagnan , full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity , placed in anne 's hands , in a bundle , the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty . <EOS>	98.09487698907752
<SOS> there are moments for if everything is not good , everything in this world is not bad in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion , heart arraigning sentiment : one of these momentary impulses actuated anne . <EOS>	91.79135005378869
<SOS> d'artagnan , when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted . <EOS>	90.28668231367699
<SOS> he was therefore instantly recompensed , either for his address or for his sensibility , whichever it might be termed . <EOS>	102.17292491626228
<SOS> `` you were right , sir , '' said anne . <EOS>	56.58766094060666
<SOS> `` i misunderstood you . <EOS>	89.49748927724646
<SOS> there are the acts signed ; i deliver them to you without compulsion . <EOS>	82.1838777000863
<SOS> go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible . '' <EOS>	93.51231434382537
<SOS> `` madame , '' faltered d'artagnan , `` 't is twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville , of kissing one of those lovely hands . '' <EOS>	48.93732906699799
<SOS> `` there is the other , '' replied the queen ; `` and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right , '' she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him , `` take and keep this ring in remembrance of me . <EOS>	88.78408678019625
<SOS> `` madame , '' said d'artagnan , rising , `` i have only one thing more to wish , which is , that the next thing you ask from me , shall be my life . '' <EOS>	95.52756797692622
<SOS> and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room . <EOS>	76.42508006161262
<SOS> `` i never rightly understood those men , '' said the queen , as she watched him retiring from her presence ; `` and it is now too late , for in a year the king will be of age . '' <EOS>	120.36961138774856
<SOS> in twenty four hours d'artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen ; and the one received his commission , the other his patent of nobility . <EOS>	74.80039303023756
<SOS> on the same day the treaty of paris was signed , and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care . <EOS>	86.39195947626723
<SOS> here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty : monsieur de conti received damvilliers , and having made his proofs as general , he succeeded in remaining a soldier , instead of being made cardinal . <EOS>	49.689685515833496
<SOS> moreover , something had been said of a marriage with mazarin 's niece . <EOS>	102.94896424146155
<SOS> the idea was welcomed by the prince , to whom it was of little importance whom he married , so long as he married some one . <EOS>	101.89610170608199
<SOS> the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court , receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered , and all the honor due to his rank . <EOS>	63.99780287565761
<SOS> full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape . <EOS>	72.75144690284768
<SOS> he received also the office of admiral , which had been held by his father , the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles , demolished by the parliament of bretagne . <EOS>	102.91915291253736
<SOS> the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan , and the title of prince , granted to him and to those belonging to his house . <EOS>	102.23853015101356
<SOS> the duc de longueville gained the government of pont de l'arche , five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and henrietta of england . <EOS>	64.60269689559297
<SOS> aramis stipulated that bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums . <EOS>	76.68177064447372
<SOS> the duc d'elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife , one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others . <EOS>	50.893690332189934
<SOS> the coadjutor alone obtained nothing . <EOS>	78.4375057936842
<SOS> they promised , indeed , to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal 's hat for him ; but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises , made by the queen and mazarin . <EOS>	109.51617984866932
<SOS> quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti , unable to be cardinal , he was obliged to remain a soldier . <EOS>	61.84949843799158
<SOS> and therefore , when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king , appointed for the next day , gondy alone , in the midst of the general happiness , was dissatisfied ; he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor . <EOS>	67.1632756964482
<SOS> those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache . <EOS>	78.20773589546017
<SOS> they came with their usual promptness , and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night . <EOS>	75.27317065365561

<SOS> difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms . <EOS>	115.76511209192245
<SOS> whilst d'artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain , athos and aramis returned to paris . <EOS>	94.23556492837639
<SOS> each had his own particular visit to make . <EOS>	63.76720965963641
<SOS> aramis rushed to the hotel de ville , where madame de longueville was sojourning . <EOS>	90.90681178947017
<SOS> the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace . <EOS>	72.25837501377444
<SOS> war had made her a queen ; peace brought her abdication . <EOS>	81.62024735404015
<SOS> she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war . <EOS>	113.93843766826126
<SOS> but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say , with all its advantages ; when he had pointed out to her , in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris , the viceroyalty of font de l'arche , in other words , of all normandy ; when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal ; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font , madame de longueville contended no longer , except as is the custom with pretty women to contend , and defended herself only to surrender at last . <EOS>	63.50405628388316
<SOS> aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion . <EOS>	89.41208137831123
<SOS> `` madame , '' he said , `` you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say , the greatest captain of the age ; and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it . <EOS>	42.36250114799858
<SOS> you have succeeded ; the prince is beaten , since he can no longer fight . <EOS>	65.59213290141318

<SOS> the fronde is a comedy , of which the first act only is played . <EOS>	76.68474711359254
<SOS> let us wait for a dénouement for the day when the prince , thanks to you , shall have turned against the court . '' <EOS>	107.74048349558258
<SOS> madame de longueville was persuaded . <EOS>	101.02283505197407
<SOS> this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes , that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de condé ; and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified . <EOS>	60.539274661489536
<SOS> athos , on quitting aramis , went to madame de chevreuse . <EOS>	78.44898194534761
<SOS> here was another frondeuse to persuade , and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival . <EOS>	78.60750317850865
<SOS> there had been no stipulation in her favor . <EOS>	45.70353744728533
<SOS> monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province , and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter . <EOS>	58.5054188977966
<SOS> at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned , and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable , contended in favor of hostilities . <EOS>	50.412899557945
<SOS> `` my fair friend , '' said athos , `` allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war . <EOS>	74.59572978558484
<SOS> you will get yourself exiled , as you did in the time of louis xiii . <EOS>	78.96692316988711
<SOS> believe me , we have passed the time of success in intrigue , and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris , where there will always be two queens as long as you are there . '' <EOS>	101.19377542630762
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried the duchess , `` i can not make war alone , but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess , i will avenge myself . '' <EOS>	71.9958426678866
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied athos , `` do not injure the vicomte de bragelonne do not ruin his prospects . <EOS>	57.4976382881215

<SOS> there are moments when a man grows young again in his children . '' <EOS>	58.1435102805014
<SOS> the duchess smiled , half tenderly , half ironically . <EOS>	62.21441217817668
<SOS> `` count , '' she said , `` you are , i fear , gained over to the court . <EOS>	85.18734641759417
<SOS> i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket ? '' <EOS>	67.45881034398803
<SOS> `` yes , madame ; i have that of the garter , which king charles i. gave me some days before he died . '' <EOS>	92.40177046503709
<SOS> `` come , i am growing an old woman ! '' <EOS>	74.43432294101362
<SOS> said the duchess , pensively . <EOS>	74.55408107202871
<SOS> athos took her hand and kissed it . <EOS>	50.3546596423591
<SOS> she sighed , as she looked at him . <EOS>	81.90438888377643
<SOS> `` count , '' she said , `` bragelonne must be a charming place . <EOS>	91.26658046652182

<SOS> you have water woods flowers there ? '' <EOS>	106.38235581921926
<SOS> she sighed again and leaned her charming head , gracefully reclined , on her hand , still beautiful in form and color . <EOS>	82.55271244405017
<SOS> `` madame ! '' <EOS>	83.1531592005621
<SOS> exclaimed athos , `` what were you saying just now about growing old ? <EOS>	69.8011851368989
<SOS> never have i seen you look so young , so beautiful ! '' <EOS>	67.49549844403724
<SOS> the duchess shook her head . <EOS>	107.1949062076634
<SOS> `` does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris ? '' <EOS>	67.84969074611885
<SOS> she inquired . <EOS>	92.2247174246909
<SOS> `` what think you of it ? '' <EOS>	75.63255194906844
<SOS> inquired athos . <EOS>	69.10850192939823
<SOS> `` leave him with me , '' replied the duchess . <EOS>	53.58831232491735
<SOS> `` no , madame ; if you have forgotten the history of oedipus , i , at least , remember it . '' <EOS>	70.96999238097752
<SOS> `` really , sir , you are delightful , and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne . '' <EOS>	63.96503487077134
<SOS> `` are you not afraid of making people envious of me , duchess ? '' <EOS>	72.522187756031
<SOS> replied athos . <EOS>	70.22161656994886
<SOS> `` no , i shall go incognito , count , under the name of marie michon . '' <EOS>	58.49592259671328
<SOS> `` you are adorable , madame . '' <EOS>	119.74871089726983
<SOS> `` but do not keep raoul with you . '' <EOS>	72.9249872083043
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	45.90672061963876

<SOS> `` and 't is a child he loves . '' <EOS>	66.15373642834993
<SOS> athos became thoughtful . <EOS>	51.198767826940376
<SOS> `` you are right , duchess . <EOS>	51.823433475412585
<SOS> this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy . <EOS>	93.53351438781347
<SOS> there is to be war in flanders . <EOS>	61.07291921487107
<SOS> he shall go thither . '' <EOS>	84.805510456753
<SOS> `` and at his return you will send him to me . <EOS>	114.875303624183
<SOS> i will arm him against love . '' <EOS>	84.72879083380207
<SOS> `` alas , madame ! '' <EOS>	107.47138132140132
<SOS> exclaimed athos , `` to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless . '' <EOS>	56.94219475618787
<SOS> raoul entered at this moment ; he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king , queen , and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day . <EOS>	95.66886306344023
<SOS> the next day , in fact , at daybreak , the court made preparations to quit saint germain . <EOS>	58.31092983918832
<SOS> meanwhile , the queen every hour had been sending for d'artagnan . <EOS>	70.6500190567394
<SOS> `` i hear , '' she said , `` that paris is not quiet . <EOS>	87.52267657342696
<SOS> i am afraid for the king 's safety ; place yourself close to the coach door on the right . '' <EOS>	76.4136593294988
<SOS> `` reassure yourself , madame , i will answer for the king 's safety . '' <EOS>	64.90580641796473
<SOS> as he left the queen 's presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal . <EOS>	111.03185626550942
<SOS> `` sir , '' said mazarin to him `` an emeute is spoken of in paris . <EOS>	48.34042781794561
<SOS> i shall be on the king 's left and as i am the chief person threatened , remain at the coach door to the left . '' <EOS>	68.94052478991829
<SOS> `` your eminence may be perfectly easy , '' replied d'artagnan ; `` they will not touch a hair of your head . '' <EOS>	97.32180271966138
<SOS> `` deuce take it ! '' <EOS>	94.29192217191834
<SOS> he thought to himself , `` how can i take care of both ? <EOS>	73.86172845424444
<SOS> ah ! <EOS>	87.90668944574077
<SOS> plague o n't , i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal . '' <EOS>	74.67319034734511
<SOS> this arrangement pleased every one . <EOS>	53.29985569272573
<SOS> the queen had confidence in the courage of d'artagnan , which she knew , and the cardinal in the strength of porthos , which he had experienced . <EOS>	40.62957401489691
<SOS> the royal procession set out for paris . <EOS>	64.51069901275872
<SOS> guitant and comminges , at the head of the guards , marched first ; then came the royal carriage , with d'artagnan on one side , porthos on the other ; then the musketeers , for two and twenty years staunch friends of d'artagnan . <EOS>	41.52509663370729
<SOS> during twenty he had been lieutenant , their captain since the night before . <EOS>	104.69298206202194
<SOS> the cortege proceeded to notre dame , where a te deum was chanted . <EOS>	53.9466635973605
<SOS> all paris were in the streets . <EOS>	105.36485495244541
<SOS> the swiss were drawn up along the road , but as the road was long , they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only . <EOS>	55.182999285409835
<SOS> this force was therefore wholly insufficient , and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty . <EOS>	43.94292080042729
<SOS> whenever this occurred , although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen , anne looked at d'artagnan anxiously . <EOS>	80.22446190568127
<SOS> mazarin , who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry `` long live mazarin , '' and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each , kept one eye on porthos ; but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice , `` be tranquil , my lord , '' and mazarin became more and more composed . <EOS>	42.21709988341196
<SOS> at the palais royal , the crowd , which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater ; like an impetuous mob , a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore . <EOS>	54.834108178125305
<SOS> when the procession reached the palace , loud cries of `` long live their majesties ! '' <EOS>	54.540719524641034
<SOS> resounded . <EOS>	93.2842917121269
<SOS> mazarin leaned out of the window . <EOS>	112.09842227684048
<SOS> one or two shouts of `` long live the cardinal '' saluted his shadow ; but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly . <EOS>	89.2247147002781
<SOS> mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach . <EOS>	80.84620551234705
<SOS> `` low born fellows ! '' <EOS>	69.78610335910518
<SOS> ejaculated porthos . <EOS>	78.14064659418403
<SOS> d'artagnan said nothing , but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake . <EOS>	91.29592730232254
<SOS> anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king 's ear : `` say something gracious to monsieur d'artagnan , my son . '' <EOS>	55.10045378643895
<SOS> the young king leaned toward the door . <EOS>	59.12281029251306
<SOS> `` i have not said good morning to you , monsieur d'artagnan , '' he said ; `` nevertheless , i have remarked you . <EOS>	79.08682288762648
<SOS> it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me asleep . '' <EOS>	69.14051505701275
<SOS> `` and if the king permits me , '' returned the gascon , `` i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered . '' <EOS>	91.22572380802549
<SOS> `` sir , '' said mazarin to porthos , `` what would you do if the crowd fell upon us ? '' <EOS>	78.55364144549203
<SOS> `` kill as many as i could , my lord . '' <EOS>	80.14902441307906
<SOS> `` hem ! <EOS>	91.98748268961546
<SOS> brave as you are and strong as you are , you could not kill them all . '' <EOS>	102.28421939316377
<SOS> `` 't is true , '' answered porthos , rising on his saddle , in order that he might appraise the immense crowd , `` there are a lot of them . '' <EOS>	93.22226287130975
<SOS> `` i think i should like the other fellow better than this one , '' said mazarin to himself , and he threw himself back in his carriage . <EOS>	43.447693865971736
<SOS> the queen and her minister , more especially the latter , had reason to feel anxious . <EOS>	69.5505556614037
<SOS> the crowd , whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent , began to be tumultuous . <EOS>	63.56027607774077
<SOS> reports were whispered about , like certain sounds which announce , as they whistle from wave to wave , the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude , presage an emeute . <EOS>	96.74582458229027
<SOS> d'artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd , but very easily understood by that chosen regiment , the flower of the army . <EOS>	73.14647364874405
<SOS> the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man . <EOS>	59.54201417889263
<SOS> at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop . <EOS>	60.45265633740843
<SOS> comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen 's carriage . <EOS>	68.38950872397893
<SOS> anne questioned d'artagnan by a look . <EOS>	64.31583703687734
<SOS> he answered in the same language . <EOS>	59.39928910508547
<SOS> `` proceed , '' she said . <EOS>	76.62194018605895
<SOS> comminges returned to his post . <EOS>	101.19410884010597
<SOS> an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through . <EOS>	89.70140930780374
<SOS> some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister . <EOS>	60.11450787541317
<SOS> `` onward ! '' <EOS>	64.4629592760039
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , in a loud voice . <EOS>	57.56295381481759
<SOS> `` onward ! '' <EOS>	90.38434176305222
<SOS> cried porthos . <EOS>	90.57399602645468
<SOS> but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out , all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously . <EOS>	94.81041045862432
<SOS> cries of `` down with mazarin ! '' <EOS>	81.9703634283867
<SOS> `` death to the cardinal ! '' <EOS>	80.5291604908249
<SOS> resounded on all sides . <EOS>	74.1313905676841
<SOS> at the same time through the streets of grenelle , saint honore , and du coq , a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos 's horse and that of d'artagnan . <EOS>	98.81048326759782
<SOS> this new eruption was more dangerous than the others , being composed of armed men . <EOS>	62.06824469737314
<SOS> it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot , but a concerted organized attack . <EOS>	51.56160054948677
<SOS> each of these mobs was led by a chief , one of whom appeared to belong , not to the people , but to the honorable corporation of mendicants , and the other , notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people , might easily be discerned to be a gentleman . <EOS>	70.04577153924431
<SOS> both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse . <EOS>	93.95832097722091
<SOS> there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage . <EOS>	58.94881160717994
<SOS> myriads of hoarse cries , forming one vast uproar , were heard , mingled with guns firing . <EOS>	46.77991199873831
<SOS> `` ho ! <EOS>	55.752817125797186
<SOS> musketeers ! '' <EOS>	70.90971667705087
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	46.0785652396456
<SOS> the escort divided into two files . <EOS>	75.79881944868218
<SOS> one of them passed around to the right of the carriage , the other to the left . <EOS>	66.6013275992591
<SOS> one went to support d'artagnan , the other porthos . <EOS>	60.20273865665411
<SOS> then came a skirmish , the more terrible because it had no definite object ; the more melancholy , because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting . <EOS>	68.25342728643373
<SOS> like all popular movements , the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable . <EOS>	72.83344041906214
<SOS> the musketeers , few in number , not being able , in the midst of this crowd , to make their horses wheel around , began to give way . <EOS>	67.12908823404624
<SOS> d'artagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage , but the young king stretched out his arm , saying : `` no , sir ! <EOS>	97.03281819067625
<SOS> i wish to see everything . '' <EOS>	79.10143646127362
<SOS> `` if your majesty wishes to look out well , then , look ! '' <EOS>	51.41120290878326
<SOS> replied d'artagnan . <EOS>	71.78718303184543
<SOS> and turning with that fury which made him so formidable , he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents , a man who , with a huge sword in his hand , was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers . <EOS>	73.58666128333992
<SOS> `` make room ! '' <EOS>	112.21828392086931
<SOS> cried d'artagnan . <EOS>	67.9326545443064
<SOS> `` zounds ! <EOS>	75.76946577688499
<SOS> give way ! '' <EOS>	86.49409517295578
<SOS> at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head , but it was too late . <EOS>	72.68747209124201
<SOS> the blow was sped by d'artagnan ; the rapier had pierced his bosom . <EOS>	67.84121936099777
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	118.09234621602977
<SOS> confound it ! '' <EOS>	105.30519720576225
<SOS> cried the gascon , trying in vain , too late , to retract the thrust . <EOS>	102.23751929097621
<SOS> `` what the devil are you doing here , count ? '' <EOS>	105.59611740848662
<SOS> `` accomplishing my destiny , '' replied rochefort , falling on one knee . <EOS>	103.80399522200308
<SOS> `` i have already got up again after three stabs from you , i shall never rise after this fourth . '' <EOS>	105.64484939105782
<SOS> `` count ! '' <EOS>	78.23895566091521
<SOS> said d'artagnan , with some degree of emotion , `` i struck without knowing that it was you . <EOS>	97.1732022351686
<SOS> i am sorry , if you die , that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me . '' <EOS>	44.788039404926664
<SOS> rochefort extended his hand to d'artagnan , who took it . <EOS>	66.32031704683406
<SOS> the count wished to speak , but a gush of blood stifled him . <EOS>	51.122215838004976
<SOS> he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired . <EOS>	49.81324604420745
<SOS> `` back , people ! '' <EOS>	68.56606685972366
<SOS> cried d'artagnan , `` your leader is dead ; you have no longer any business here . '' <EOS>	55.39501185474076
<SOS> indeed , as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack , the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall . <EOS>	58.26560142538179
<SOS> d'artagnan charged , with a party of musketeers , up the rue du coq , and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke , dispersing near the place saint germain l'auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays . <EOS>	83.7816938809568
<SOS> d'artagnan returned to help porthos , if porthos needed help ; but porthos , for his part , had done his work as conscientiously as d'artagnan . <EOS>	74.15488559415198
<SOS> the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right , and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin , less heroic than the king , had taken the precaution to lower . <EOS>	91.6667420112622
<SOS> porthos looked very melancholy . <EOS>	53.83627469060872
<SOS> `` what a devil of a face you have , porthos ! <EOS>	61.71562148887693
<SOS> and what a strange air for a victor ! '' <EOS>	107.5910775694296
<SOS> `` but you , '' answered porthos , `` seem to me agitated . '' <EOS>	51.651979749166756
<SOS> `` there 's a reason ! <EOS>	73.99255459093526
<SOS> zounds ! <EOS>	94.57034892421149
<SOS> i have just killed an old friend . '' <EOS>	108.73753361009967
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	88.49756633379714
<SOS> replied porthos , `` who ? '' <EOS>	72.0846640811604
<SOS> `` that poor count de rochefort . '' <EOS>	68.7357018541344
<SOS> `` well ! <EOS>	87.40250630009292
<SOS> exactly like me ! <EOS>	106.24929895447471
<SOS> i have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me . <EOS>	66.75865655814856
<SOS> unluckily , i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood . '' <EOS>	87.4735357792083
<SOS> `` and he said nothing as he died ? '' <EOS>	115.0327369597758
<SOS> `` yes ; he exclaimed , 'oh ! ' '' <EOS>	50.83116992480718
<SOS> `` i suppose , '' answered d'artagnan , laughing , `` if he only said that , it did not enlighten you much . '' <EOS>	56.182063380638915
<SOS> `` well , sir ! '' <EOS>	49.81380388241054
<SOS> cried the queen . <EOS>	107.38049035983447
<SOS> `` madame , the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road . '' <EOS>	89.74358509841312
<SOS> in fact , the procession arrived , in safety at notre dame , at the front gate of which all the clergy , with the coadjutor at their head , awaited the king , the queen and the minister , for whose happy return they chanted a te deum . <EOS>	73.20362252857731
<SOS> as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement , ran to the sacristy , dressed himself quickly in the choir robes , and cleaving , thanks to that uniform , the crowd that filled the temple , approached bazin , who , clad in his blue robe , was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir . <EOS>	84.39675557717032
<SOS> bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve . <EOS>	87.46668834966496
<SOS> he lowered to earth his eyes , beatifically raised to heaven , and recognized friquet . <EOS>	60.25374888949876
<SOS> `` well , you rascal , what is it ? <EOS>	75.06726397283586
<SOS> how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions ? '' <EOS>	85.96225815957705
<SOS> asked the beadle . <EOS>	43.43748280200834
<SOS> `` monsieur bazin , '' said friquet , `` monsieur maillard you know who he is , he gives holy water at saint eustache `` `` well , go on . '' <EOS>	82.10838789966922
<SOS> `` well , he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head . <EOS>	96.05623906100632
<SOS> that great giant who was there gave it to him . '' <EOS>	79.86040032804019
<SOS> `` in that case , '' said bazin , `` he must be pretty sick . '' <EOS>	48.658622724137025
<SOS> `` so sick that he is dying , and he wants to confess to the coadjutor , who , they say , has power to remit great sins . '' <EOS>	54.613423493592954
<SOS> `` and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him ? '' <EOS>	79.50037960413785
<SOS> `` to be sure ; the coadjutor has promised . '' <EOS>	76.76281219941836
<SOS> `` who told you that ? '' <EOS>	75.21446546995746
<SOS> `` monsieur maillard himself . '' <EOS>	115.93550481858982
<SOS> `` you have seen him , then ? '' <EOS>	87.20670292914379
<SOS> `` certainly ; i was there when he fell . '' <EOS>	50.841657134413154
<SOS> `` what were you doing there ? '' <EOS>	107.22944739603705
<SOS> `` i was shouting , 'down with mazarin ! ' <EOS>	69.1767741384269

<SOS> 'the italian to the gallows ! ' <EOS>	87.09068595001223
<SOS> is n't that what you would have me shout ? '' <EOS>	44.47076859251413
<SOS> `` be quiet , you rascal ! '' <EOS>	65.62690107663818
<SOS> said bazin , looking uneasily around . <EOS>	85.4576948458561
<SOS> `` so that he told me , that poor monsieur maillard , 'go find the coadjutor , friquet , and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir . ' <EOS>	101.84412952762737

<SOS> hey ! <EOS>	84.66930180595692
<SOS> i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms ! <EOS>	65.86117501974577
<SOS> all the same , i should like to do him that service what do you say to it ? '' <EOS>	72.53475221528463
<SOS> `` i will tell the coadjutor , '' said bazin . <EOS>	73.79124281870052
<SOS> in fact , he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words , to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign . <EOS>	60.616484396252716
<SOS> he then returned with the same slow step and said : `` go and tell the dying man that he must be patient . <EOS>	90.41043061080336
<SOS> monseigneur will be with him in an hour . '' <EOS>	59.03715134045763
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	46.77490752580151
<SOS> said friquet , `` my fortune is made . '' <EOS>	81.40492045514789
<SOS> `` by the way , '' said bazin , `` where was he carried ? '' <EOS>	66.61340305025969
<SOS> `` to the tower saint jacques la boucherie ; '' and delighted with the success of his embassy , friquet started off at the top of his speed . <EOS>	50.332219327426486
<SOS> when the te deum was over , the coadjutor , without stopping to change his priestly dress , took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well . <EOS>	88.74764589540324
<SOS> he arrived in time . <EOS>	88.39621541696411
<SOS> though sinking from moment to moment , the wounded man was not yet dead . <EOS>	92.62160281608801
<SOS> the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering . <EOS>	70.49017089097616
<SOS> a moment later friquet went out , carrying in his hand a large leather bag ; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold . <EOS>	110.63309134973682
<SOS> the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir . <EOS>	41.4701506653535
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	59.945642631681785
<SOS> mother nanette ! '' <EOS>	54.14758612073295

<SOS> mother nanette ! '' <EOS>	67.1118936907406
<SOS> he could say no more ; but though he had n't strength to speak he had enough for action . <EOS>	88.98329284150532
<SOS> he rushed headlong to the street , and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens , with his laurel in his hand , friquet reached councillor broussel 's threshold , and then fell exhausted , scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag . <EOS>	97.28481721328687
<SOS> mother nanette began by picking up the louis ; then she picked up friquet . <EOS>	46.74672492447428
<SOS> in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal . <EOS>	70.53705885524904
<SOS> `` that monsieur d'artagnan is a very brave man , mother , '' said the young king . <EOS>	72.2424323779906
<SOS> `` yes , my son ; and he rendered very important services to your father . <EOS>	63.71399506298228

<SOS> `` captain , '' said the young king to d'artagnan , on descending from the carriage , `` the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon . '' <EOS>	78.15542122878729
<SOS> that was a great honor for d'artagnan and for porthos . <EOS>	83.37208774489133
<SOS> porthos was delighted ; and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied . <EOS>	116.81439914087838
<SOS> `` what was the matter with you , baron ? '' <EOS>	83.87229162894594
<SOS> d'artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal . <EOS>	90.15617778873188
<SOS> `` you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something . '' <EOS>	77.34039581599012

<SOS> `` and you could n't remember ? '' <EOS>	100.7790252437659
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	64.7529216287249

<SOS> conclusion . <EOS>	61.25762323573588
<SOS> on going home , the two friends found a letter from athos , who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day . <EOS>	96.82200551772712
<SOS> the friends went to bed early , but neither of them slept . <EOS>	96.41616943647959
<SOS> when we arrive at the summit of our wishes , success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes . <EOS>	83.73025090467388
<SOS> the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume . <EOS>	101.91966662454878
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	78.37992271158366
<SOS> cried porthos , `` are we all going away , then ? <EOS>	94.64662702294187
<SOS> i also have made my preparations this morning . '' <EOS>	69.32892926719963
<SOS> `` oh , heavens ! <EOS>	70.65688901577178

<SOS> `` there 's nothing to do in paris now there 's no fronde . <EOS>	64.64816917188737

<SOS> raoul has no fortune other than i possess , poor child ! <EOS>	59.75690751160551

<SOS> you shall take him with you there . <EOS>	106.5188344928752
<SOS> i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind . <EOS>	76.32695232581142
<SOS> take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself . '' <EOS>	41.732669461377746
<SOS> `` then , '' replied d'artagnan , `` though i shall not have you , athos , at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me ; and though he 's but a boy , yet , since your soul lives again in him , dear athos , i shall always fancy that you are near me , sustaining and encouraging me . '' <EOS>	50.44714060534271
<SOS> the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes . <EOS>	95.60153974088699
<SOS> then they departed , without knowing whether they would ever see each other again . <EOS>	67.6884136941392
<SOS> d'artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos , still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed . <EOS>	111.10068303125344
<SOS> on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron 's equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle . <EOS>	66.74093871075058
<SOS> `` come , d'artagnan , '' said porthos , `` bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds , to bracieux , or to du vallon . <EOS>	60.292778671008115

<SOS> cried porthos , who was not completely taken in by d'artagnan 's gasconades . <EOS>	82.70775332685102
<SOS> `` come my brother , go with me , '' added d'artagnan , `` and i will see that you are made a duke ! '' <EOS>	63.87611473513356
<SOS> `` no , '' answered porthos , `` mouston has no desire to fight ; besides , they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony , which will kill my neighbors with envy . '' <EOS>	102.9989244165104
<SOS> `` to that i can say nothing , '' returned d'artagnan , who knew the vanity of the new baron . <EOS>	53.30788556837722
<SOS> `` then , here 's to our next merry meeting ! '' <EOS>	93.02066929117615
<SOS> `` adieu , dear captain , '' said porthos , `` i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony . '' <EOS>	81.45496494896194
<SOS> `` yes , yes , when the campaign is over , '' replied the gascon . <EOS>	46.24613854572982
<SOS> `` his honor 's equipage is waiting , '' said mousqueton . <EOS>	81.04632679896818
<SOS> the two friends , after a cordial pressure of the hands , separated . <EOS>	76.09976504231183
<SOS> d'artagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze , when the baron , after walking scarcely more than twenty paces , returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed : `` i recollect ! '' <EOS>	52.895866330636146
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	83.77909672055776

<SOS> `` 't was that low fellow , bonacieux . '' <EOS>	53.148815067529355
<SOS> and porthos , enchanted at having relieved his mind , rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street . <EOS>	51.1310898377408
<SOS> d'artagnan stood for an instant , mute , pensive and motionless ; then , as he went in , he saw the fair madeleine , his hostess , standing on the threshold . <EOS>	59.404034438451575

<SOS> marseilles the arrival on the < num > th of february , < num > , the look out at notre dame de la garde signalled the three master , the pharaon from smyrna , trieste , and naples . <EOS>	92.83386323559996
<SOS> as usual , a pilot put off immediately , and rounding the château d'if , got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island . <EOS>	48.58494005023566
<SOS> immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the pharaon , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city . <EOS>	60.45472257011731
<SOS> the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait , which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands ; had doubled pomègue , and approached the harbor under topsails , jib , and spanker , but so slowly and sedately that the idlers , with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil , asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board . <EOS>	101.85655952899853
<SOS> however , those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred , it was not to the vessel herself , for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled , the anchor a cockbill , the jib boom guys already eased off , and standing by the side of the pilot , who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port , was a young man , who , with activity and vigilant eye , watched every motion of the ship , and repeated each direction of the pilot . <EOS>	107.30463877407017
<SOS> the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor , but jumping into a small skiff , desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon , which he reached as she rounded into la réserve basin . <EOS>	109.96122755145934
<SOS> when the young man on board saw this person approach , he left his station by the pilot , and , hat in hand , leaned over the ship 's bulwarks . <EOS>	55.69376527063933
<SOS> he was a fine , tall , slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty , with black eyes , and hair as dark as a raven 's wing ; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger . <EOS>	112.6633543180662
<SOS> `` ah , is it you , dantès ? '' <EOS>	52.04861578855924
<SOS> cried the man in the skiff . <EOS>	53.98881186047611
<SOS> `` what 's the matter ? <EOS>	90.02136713400863
<SOS> and why have you such an air of sadness aboard ? '' <EOS>	79.99564327038405
<SOS> `` a great misfortune , m. morrel , '' replied the young man , `` a great misfortune , for me especially ! <EOS>	89.10306898532485
<SOS> off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere . '' <EOS>	79.84048222626392
<SOS> `` and the cargo ? '' <EOS>	75.02988788769335
<SOS> inquired the owner , eagerly . <EOS>	67.63187892480353
<SOS> `` is all safe , m. morrel ; and i think you will be satisfied on that head . <EOS>	81.53115896524127
<SOS> but poor captain leclere `` `` what happened to him ? '' <EOS>	104.58127333618997
<SOS> asked the owner , with an air of considerable resignation . <EOS>	54.02501854867813
<SOS> `` what happened to the worthy captain ? '' <EOS>	107.2331585612579
<SOS> `` he died . '' <EOS>	103.14118064328575
<SOS> `` fell into the sea ? '' <EOS>	41.2293668252978
<SOS> `` no , sir , he died of brain fever in dreadful agony . '' <EOS>	122.74304645411338
<SOS> then turning to the crew , he said , `` bear a hand there , to take in sail ! '' <EOS>	53.353895037156484
<SOS> all hands obeyed , and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew , sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul , topsail sheets and halyards , the jib downhaul , and the topsail clewlines and buntlines . <EOS>	58.64997280149883
<SOS> the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed , and then turned again to the owner . <EOS>	66.5529913305591
<SOS> `` and how did this misfortune occur ? '' <EOS>	59.90170308297037
<SOS> inquired the latter , resuming the interrupted conversation . <EOS>	80.97562956715684
<SOS> < num > m `` alas , sir , in the most unexpected manner . <EOS>	82.6410022421476
<SOS> after a long talk with the harbor master , captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind . <EOS>	75.31192978207258
<SOS> in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever , and died three days afterwards . <EOS>	83.6081630659004
<SOS> we performed the usual burial service , and he is at his rest , sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels , off el giglio island . <EOS>	81.50206477217861
<SOS> we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor . <EOS>	38.47428984730135
<SOS> it was worth while , truly , '' added the young man with a melancholy smile , `` to make war against the english for ten years , and to die in his bed at last , like everybody else . '' <EOS>	68.70702929302621
<SOS> `` why , you see , edmond , '' replied the owner , who appeared more comforted at every moment , `` we are all mortal , and the old must make way for the young . <EOS>	81.2829747933303
<SOS> if not , why , there would be no promotion ; and since you assure me that the cargo `` `` is all safe and sound , m. morrel , take my word for it ; and i advise you not to take < num > , < num > francs for the profits of the voyage . '' <EOS>	58.17740129088898
<SOS> then , as they were just passing the round tower , the young man shouted : `` stand by there to lower the topsails and jib ; brail up the spanker ! '' <EOS>	45.82539732540938
<SOS> the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war . <EOS>	79.20547802194412
<SOS> `` let go and clue up ! '' <EOS>	49.711467739262616
<SOS> at this last command all the sails were lowered , and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards . <EOS>	69.8312010718062
<SOS> `` now , if you will come on board , m. morrel , '' said dantès , observing the owner 's impatience , `` here is your supercargo , m. danglars , coming out of his cabin , who will furnish you with every particular . <EOS>	72.5970767596416
<SOS> as for me , i must look after the anchoring , and dress the ship in mourning . '' <EOS>	96.9164413372082
<SOS> the owner did not wait for a second invitation . <EOS>	78.25063252017574
<SOS> he seized a rope which dantès flung to him , and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor , climbed up the side of the ship , while the young man , going to his task , left the conversation to danglars , who now came towards the owner . <EOS>	83.85869409356917
<SOS> he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age , of unprepossessing countenance , obsequious to his superiors , insolent to his subordinates ; and this , in addition to his position as responsible agent on board , which is always obnoxious to the sailors , made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them . <EOS>	63.38840222254839
<SOS> `` well , m. morrel , '' said danglars , `` you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us ? '' <EOS>	63.62205137604268
<SOS> `` yes yes : poor captain leclere ! <EOS>	89.73941123329249
<SOS> he was a brave and an honest man . '' <EOS>	99.04986786918471
<SOS> `` and a first rate seaman , one who had seen long and honorable service , as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel & son , '' replied danglars . <EOS>	87.23312135240953
<SOS> `` but , '' replied the owner , glancing after dantès , who was watching the anchoring of his vessel , `` it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say , danglars , to understand his business , for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly , and not to require instruction from anyone . '' <EOS>	71.30572050979654
<SOS> `` yes , '' said danglars , darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate . <EOS>	57.56023587202659
<SOS> `` yes , he is young , and youth is invariably self confident . <EOS>	104.66183770399064
<SOS> scarcely was the captain 's breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone , and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba , instead of making for marseilles direct . '' <EOS>	99.97326015802554
<SOS> < num > m `` as to taking command of the vessel , '' replied morrel , `` that was his duty as captain 's mate ; as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba , he was wrong , unless the vessel needed repairs . '' <EOS>	69.75110382585646
<SOS> `` the vessel was in as good condition as i am , and as , i hope you are , m. morrel , and this day and a half was lost from pure whim , for the pleasure of going ashore , and nothing else . '' <EOS>	61.69773232133435
<SOS> `` dantès , '' said the shipowner , turning towards the young man , `` come this way ! '' <EOS>	88.33057086622145
<SOS> `` in a moment , sir , '' answered dantès , `` and i 'm with you . '' <EOS>	97.49029220276549
<SOS> then calling to the crew , he said , `` let go ! '' <EOS>	102.36214312486437
<SOS> the anchor was instantly dropped , and the chain ran rattling through the port hole . <EOS>	91.99907917996002
<SOS> dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot , until this manœuvre was completed , and then he added , `` half mast the colors , and square the yards ! '' <EOS>	72.00786834723878
<SOS> `` you see , '' said danglars , `` he fancies himself captain already , upon my word . '' <EOS>	79.12786868662053
<SOS> `` and so , in fact , he is , '' said the owner . <EOS>	76.24563341043606
<SOS> `` except your signature and your partner 's , m . <EOS>	98.8452622535913
<SOS> morrel . '' <EOS>	67.93194791863074
<SOS> `` and why should he not have this ? '' <EOS>	40.44559991564235
<SOS> asked the owner ; `` he is young , it is true , but he seems to me a thorough seaman , and of full experience . '' <EOS>	59.32693589613444
<SOS> a cloud passed over danglars ' brow . <EOS>	123.01811018910693
<SOS> `` your pardon , m. morrel , '' said dantès , approaching , `` the vessel now rides at anchor , and i am at your service . <EOS>	51.91581345379669
<SOS> you hailed me , i think ? '' <EOS>	107.90629026306046
<SOS> danglars retreated a step or two . <EOS>	72.32210176304444
<SOS> `` i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba ? '' <EOS>	45.10050250308202
<SOS> `` i do not know , sir ; it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere , who , when dying , gave me a packet for marshal bertrand . '' <EOS>	93.58753722370977
<SOS> `` then did you see him , edmond ? '' <EOS>	75.0927039303963
<SOS> `` who ? '' <EOS>	67.06729549781244
<SOS> `` the marshal . '' <EOS>	45.10759877849351
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	44.068946342073914
<SOS> morrel looked around him , and then , drawing dantès on one side , he said suddenly `` and how is the emperor ? '' <EOS>	83.1679934066802
<SOS> `` very well , as far as i could judge from the sight of him . '' <EOS>	77.08699562135483
<SOS> `` you saw the emperor , then ? '' <EOS>	91.56909787844118
<SOS> `` he entered the marshal 's apartment while i was there . '' <EOS>	50.04010780345929
<SOS> `` and you spoke to him ? '' <EOS>	56.759719561522616
<SOS> `` why , it was he who spoke to me , sir , '' said dantès , with a smile . <EOS>	73.93214789281441
<SOS> `` and what did he say to you ? '' <EOS>	85.96594388272858
<SOS> `` asked me questions about the vessel , the time she left marseilles , the course she had taken , and what was her cargo . <EOS>	87.73166776189592
<SOS> i believe , if she had not been laden , and i had been her master , he would have bought her . <EOS>	93.14496482684679
<SOS> but i told him i was only mate , and that she belonged to the firm of morrel & son . <EOS>	51.29492854762612
<SOS> 'ah , yes , ' he said , ' i know them . <EOS>	90.06752814024657
<SOS> the morrels have been shipowners from father to son ; and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence . ' '' <EOS>	45.77007834901105

<SOS> come , come , '' continued he , patting edmond 's shoulder kindly , `` you did very right , dantès , to follow captain leclere 's instructions , and touch at elba , although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal , and had conversed with the emperor , it might bring you into trouble .

<SOS> < num > m `` how could that bring me into trouble , sir ? '' <EOS>	75.52442694464422
<SOS> asked dantès ; `` for i did not even know of what i was the bearer ; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer . <EOS>	91.14377611372663

<SOS> as he departed , danglars approached , and said , `` well , it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo ? '' <EOS>	72.45277513125872
<SOS> `` yes , most satisfactory , my dear danglars . '' <EOS>	72.37363758839972
<SOS> `` well , so much the better , '' said the supercargo ; `` for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty . '' <EOS>	70.34601072923938
<SOS> `` dantès has done his , '' replied the owner , `` and that is not saying much . <EOS>	116.37482325050809

<SOS> `` why , that which dantès left at porto ferrajo . '' <EOS>	54.09266848353429
<SOS> `` how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo ? '' <EOS>	83.9029696303339
<SOS> danglars turned very red . <EOS>	57.00656245097146
<SOS> `` i was passing close to the door of the captain 's cabin , which was half open , and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès . '' <EOS>	59.47469013713212
<SOS> `` he did not speak to me of it , '' replied the shipowner ; `` but if there be any letter he will give it to me . '' <EOS>	65.61432514530215
<SOS> danglars reflected for a moment . <EOS>	89.90073789089125

<SOS> `` that proves , at least , that he has wanted for nothing during your absence . '' <EOS>	68.96275469723346
<SOS> dantès smiled . <EOS>	75.37800664613367
<SOS> `` my father is proud , sir , and if he had not a meal left , i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone , except from heaven . '' <EOS>	102.575178972758

<SOS> do you mean is he a good comrade ? <EOS>	66.42010844382047
<SOS> no , for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough , after a little quarrel we had , to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest , and he quite right to refuse . <EOS>	56.97776108967315

<SOS> good luck to you . '' <EOS>	77.17889112946331
<SOS> the young sailor jumped into the skiff , and sat down in the stern sheets , with the order that he be put ashore at la canebière . <EOS>	95.68529343257606
<SOS> the two oarsmen bent to their work , and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d'orléans . <EOS>	90.3116570091916
<SOS> the shipowner , smiling , followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng , which from five o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night , swarms in the famous street of la canebière , a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world , and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said , `` if paris had la canebière , paris would be a second marseilles . '' <EOS>	84.54830855529059
<SOS> on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him , apparently awaiting orders , but in reality also watching the young sailor , but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès . <EOS>	66.10094351255619
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	112.44154578151135
<SOS> father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred , and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade , and follow dantès , who , after having traversed la canebière , took the rue de noailles , and entering a small house , on the left of the allées de meilhan , rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase , holding the baluster with one hand , while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart , and paused before a half open door , from which he could see the whole of a small room . <EOS>	72.18246602767181
<SOS> this room was occupied by dantès ' father . <EOS>	113.44004854160345
<SOS> the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man , who , mounted on a chair , was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window . <EOS>	53.13870567868598
<SOS> suddenly , he felt an arm thrown around his body , and a well known voice behind him exclaimed , `` father dear father ! '' <EOS>	65.0613098588356
<SOS> the old man uttered a cry , and turned round ; then , seeing his son , he fell into his arms , pale and trembling . <EOS>	80.61136414243767
<SOS> `` what ails you , my dearest father ? <EOS>	94.95220703916793

<SOS> `` no , no , my dear edmond my boy my son ! <EOS>	39.866327530251176

<SOS> only imagine me a captain at twenty , with a hundred louis pay , and a share in the profits ! <EOS>	61.79266281615586
<SOS> is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for ? '' <EOS>	93.36733716840729
<SOS> `` yes , my dear boy , '' replied the old man , `` it is very fortunate . '' <EOS>	89.81778279575752
<SOS> `` well , then , with the first money i touch , i mean you to have a small house , with a garden in which to plant clematis , nasturtiums , and honeysuckle . <EOS>	54.96069606300387

<SOS> `` 't is nothing , nothing ; it will soon pass away '' and as he said so the old man 's strength failed him , and he fell backwards . <EOS>	67.17575262275008
<SOS> `` come , come , '' said the young man , `` a glass of wine , father , will revive you . <EOS>	59.51832492944407

<SOS> `` yes , yes , father , tell me where it is , '' and he opened two or three cupboards . <EOS>	73.52823135119819

<SOS> as edmond paused , the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door . <EOS>	81.71046821510778
<SOS> he was a man of twenty five or six , and held a piece of cloth , which , being a tailor , he was about to make into a coat lining . <EOS>	90.66109314982083
<SOS> `` what , is it you , edmond , back again ? '' <EOS>	70.13452401104877

<SOS> `` yes , as you see , neighbor caderousse ; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way , '' replied dantès , but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility . <EOS>	102.76062368774947

<SOS> but it seems you have come back rich , my boy , '' continued the tailor , looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table . <EOS>	71.65768079389584
<SOS> the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor . <EOS>	90.88441920201055
<SOS> `` eh , '' he said , negligently , `` this money is not mine . <EOS>	61.62074073401052
<SOS> i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence , and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table . <EOS>	80.07224527831148

<SOS> `` yes , my dear father , '' replied edmond , smiling at his father 's astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son . <EOS>	64.7710335538644
<SOS> `` and why did you refuse , my son ? '' <EOS>	64.60855608801054

<SOS> `` and when you are looking forward to be captain , it was wrong to annoy the owner . '' <EOS>	81.193051456038
<SOS> `` but i explained to him the cause of my refusal , '' replied dantès , `` and i hope he fully understood it . '' <EOS>	70.77051960555573

<SOS> `` his wife ! '' <EOS>	55.67329998609305
<SOS> said caderousse ; `` why , how fast you go on , father dantès ; she is not his wife yet , as it seems to me . '' <EOS>	57.568586060560996
<SOS> `` no , but according to all probability she soon will be , '' replied edmond . <EOS>	56.52067223484522

<SOS> `` and why ? '' <EOS>	56.35525151820512

<SOS> `` really ? '' <EOS>	107.08171074486239

<SOS> `` i will go directly , '' was edmond 's reply ; and , embracing his father , and nodding to caderousse , he left the apartment . <EOS>	86.21480395710108
<SOS> caderousse lingered for a moment , then taking leave of old dantès , he went downstairs to rejoin danglars , who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac . <EOS>	74.54512714373405
<SOS> `` well , '' said danglars , `` did you see him ? '' <EOS>	86.2946002801371

<SOS> `` so that he is quite elated about it ? '' <EOS>	59.8925714999391
<SOS> `` why , yes , he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage , as if he were a grand personage , and proffered me a loan of money , as though he were a banker . '' <EOS>	93.6757032406297
<SOS> `` which you refused ? '' <EOS>	83.1455223858688
<SOS> `` most assuredly ; although i might easily have accepted it , for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned ; but now m. dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain . '' <EOS>	103.92342336132606
<SOS> `` pooh ! '' <EOS>	92.87385760640569

<SOS> `` if we choose , '' replied danglars , `` he will remain what he is ; and perhaps become even less than he is . '' <EOS>	66.56890945514553

<SOS> `` and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans ? '' <EOS>	54.02297660229733

<SOS> `` come along , '' said caderousse ; `` but you pay the score . '' <EOS>	74.0851908894242
<SOS> `` of course , '' replied danglars ; and going quickly to the designated place , they called for a bottle of wine , and two glasses . <EOS>	65.80036111430886
<SOS> père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before ; and assured that he was at the catalans , they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores , in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring . <EOS>	53.33426253441771

<SOS> the catalans beyond a bare , weather worn wall , about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine , was the village of the catalans . <EOS>	48.912025297175695
<SOS> long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain , and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day . <EOS>	57.54418587845412
<SOS> whence it came no one knew , and it spoke an unknown tongue . <EOS>	72.55887404397815
<SOS> one of its chiefs , who understood provençal , begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory , where , like the sailors of old , they had run their boats ashore . <EOS>	67.9658582494541
<SOS> the request was granted ; and three months afterwards , around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea , a small village sprang up . <EOS>	62.06386426833557
<SOS> this village , constructed in a singular and picturesque manner , half moorish , half spanish , still remains , and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers , who speak the language of their fathers . <EOS>	100.09061108641308
<SOS> for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory , on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds , without mixing with the marseillaise population , intermarrying , and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language . <EOS>	90.94881444916341
<SOS> our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village , and enter with us one of the houses , which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country , and within coated with whitewash , like a spanish posada . <EOS>	49.3579709887498
<SOS> a young and beautiful girl , with hair as black as jet , her eyes as velvety as the gazelle 's , was leaning with her back against the wainscot , rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms , the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor ; her arms , bare to the elbow , brown , and modelled after those of the arlesian venus , moved with a kind of restless impatience , and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot , so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg , in its red cotton , gray and blue clocked , stocking . <EOS>	79.80636131257815
<SOS> at three paces from her , seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs , leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table , was a tall young man of twenty , or two and twenty , who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled . <EOS>	53.99476806789281
<SOS> he questioned her with his eyes , but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look . <EOS>	111.22759295193484
<SOS> `` you see , mercédès , '' said the young man , `` here is easter come round again ; tell me , is this the moment for a wedding ? '' <EOS>	113.85927804161973

<SOS> to lose you my friendship if he were conquered , and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor . <EOS>	64.48555216881469
<SOS> believe me , to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man . <EOS>	42.093682663088686
<SOS> no , fernand , you will not thus give way to evil thoughts . <EOS>	66.98467930257257
<SOS> unable to have me for your wife , you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister ; and besides , '' she added , her eyes troubled and moistened with tears , `` wait , wait , fernand ; you said just now that the sea was treacherous , and he has been gone four months , and during these four months there have been some terrible storms .

<SOS> fernand made no reply , nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès , although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart 's blood ; but these tears flowed for another . <EOS>	110.61818700536384
<SOS> he arose , paced a while up and down the hut , and then , suddenly stopping before mercédès , with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched , `` say , mercédès , '' he said , `` once for all , is this your final determination ? '' <EOS>	89.5651349230279
<SOS> `` i love edmond dantès , '' the young girl calmly replied , `` and none but edmond shall ever be my husband . '' <EOS>	53.5110348903908

<SOS> `` if he has forgotten you `` `` mercédès ! '' <EOS>	79.49510254212593
<SOS> called a joyous voice from without , `` mercédès ! '' <EOS>	68.90567060142897
<SOS> `` ah , '' exclaimed the young girl , blushing with delight , and fairly leaping in excess of love , `` you see he has not forgotten me , for here he is ! '' <EOS>	84.64831088801117
<SOS> and rushing towards the door , she opened it , saying , `` here , edmond , here i am ! '' <EOS>	58.09796218684103
<SOS> fernand , pale and trembling , drew back , like a traveller at the sight of a serpent , and fell into a chair beside him . <EOS>	75.32875472665286
<SOS> edmond and mercédès were clasped in each other 's arms . <EOS>	69.58114679920195
<SOS> the burning marseilles sun , which shot into the room through the open door , covered them with a flood of light . <EOS>	56.84098048953716
<SOS> at first they saw nothing around them . <EOS>	55.097409118812486
<SOS> their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world , and they only spoke in broken words , which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow . <EOS>	100.82974815998614
<SOS> suddenly edmond saw the gloomy , pale , and threatening countenance of fernand , as it was defined in the shadow . <EOS>	78.79149466360944
<SOS> by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself , the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt . <EOS>	57.67336322704044
<SOS> `` ah , your pardon , '' said dantès , frowning in his turn ; `` i did not perceive that there were three of us . '' <EOS>	48.05823856362971
<SOS> then , turning to mercédès , he inquired , `` who is this gentleman ? '' <EOS>	64.7145106636824
<SOS> `` one who will be your best friend , dantès , for he is my friend , my cousin , my brother ; it is fernand the man whom , after you , edmond , i love the best in the world . <EOS>	68.03390560705971
<SOS> do you not remember him ? '' <EOS>	104.84167006214089
<SOS> `` yes ! '' <EOS>	87.30545865489053
<SOS> said dantès , and without relinquishing mercédès ' hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air . <EOS>	47.70963911315965
<SOS> but fernand , instead of responding to this amiable gesture , remained mute and trembling . <EOS>	63.266620534940884
<SOS> edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès , and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand . <EOS>	63.168949055061425
<SOS> this look told him all , and his anger waxed hot . <EOS>	85.46721374907968
<SOS> `` i did not know , when i came with such haste to you , that i was to meet an enemy here . '' <EOS>	72.49671266857187
<SOS> `` an enemy ! '' <EOS>	86.5375112877296
<SOS> cried mercédès , with an angry look at her cousin . <EOS>	89.60220541123597
<SOS> `` an enemy in my house , do you say , edmond ! <EOS>	92.90231647369997
<SOS> if i believed that , i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles , leaving the house to return to it no more . '' <EOS>	73.20785874686582
<SOS> fernand 's eye darted lightning . <EOS>	68.25722993895508
<SOS> `` and should any misfortune occur to you , dear edmond , '' she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought , `` if misfortune should occur to you , i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it . '' <EOS>	76.17196341703665
<SOS> fernand became deadly pale . <EOS>	48.619119360169215
<SOS> `` but you are deceived , edmond , '' she continued . <EOS>	54.810108914745044
<SOS> `` you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand , my brother , who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend . '' <EOS>	88.82880513250923
<SOS> and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan , who , as if fascinated by it , came slowly towards edmond , and offered him his hand . <EOS>	99.84096544480877
<SOS> his hatred , like a powerless though furious wave , was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him . <EOS>	87.42865157235417
<SOS> scarcely , however , had he touched edmond 's hand when he felt he had done all he could do , and rushed hastily out of the house . <EOS>	78.4749366299637
<SOS> `` oh , '' he exclaimed , running furiously and tearing his hair `` oh , who will deliver me from this man ? <EOS>	85.47744343001838

<SOS> exclaimed a voice . <EOS>	104.2519896277565
<SOS> the young man stopped suddenly , looked around him , and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars , under an arbor . <EOS>	50.529415379257514
<SOS> `` well '' , said caderousse , `` why do n't you come ? <EOS>	47.237687007556076
<SOS> are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends ? '' <EOS>	54.48419998642405
<SOS> `` particularly when they have still a full bottle before them , '' added danglars . <EOS>	115.3107885179062
<SOS> fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air , but did not say a word . <EOS>	85.42589016780046
<SOS> `` he seems besotted , '' said danglars , pushing caderousse with his knee . <EOS>	93.63776523159888
<SOS> `` are we mistaken , and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed ? '' <EOS>	67.66488901041826
<SOS> `` why , we must inquire into that , '' was caderousse 's reply ; and turning towards the young man , said , `` well , catalan , ca n't you make up your mind ? '' <EOS>	74.39549004330848
<SOS> fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow , and slowly entered the arbor , whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses , and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body . <EOS>	87.66973581409138
<SOS> `` good day , '' said he . <EOS>	61.638501583768026
<SOS> `` you called me , did n't you ? '' <EOS>	77.25026795749162
<SOS> and he fell , rather than sat down , on one of the seats which surrounded the table . <EOS>	77.94439690141584
<SOS> `` i called you because you were running like a madman , and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea , '' said caderousse , laughing . <EOS>	98.90099256311389
<SOS> `` why , when a man has friends , they are not only to offer him a glass of wine , but , moreover , to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily ! '' <EOS>	80.19402214828752
<SOS> fernand gave a groan , which resembled a sob , and dropped his head into his hands , his elbows leaning on the table . <EOS>	78.68268645845555
<SOS> `` well , fernand , i must say , '' said caderousse , beginning the conversation , with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy , `` you look uncommonly like a rejected lover ; '' and he burst into a hoarse laugh . <EOS>	73.82745361780783
<SOS> `` bah ! '' <EOS>	73.28440052800937
<SOS> said danglars , `` a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love . <EOS>	95.30522345589075
<SOS> you are laughing at him , caderousse . '' <EOS>	64.14819051658289
<SOS> `` no , '' he replied , `` only hark how he sighs ! <EOS>	91.43271831834244
<SOS> come , come , fernand , '' said caderousse , `` hold up your head , and answer us . <EOS>	82.04191199813035
<SOS> it 's not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health . '' <EOS>	48.92568828530053
<SOS> `` my health is well enough , '' said fernand , clenching his hands without raising his head . <EOS>	94.5064109165437
<SOS> `` ah , you see , danglars , '' said caderousse , winking at his friend , `` this is how it is ; fernand , whom you see here , is a good and brave catalan , one of the best fishermen in marseilles , and he is in love with a very fine girl , named mercédès ; but it appears , unfortunately , that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon ; and as the pharaon arrived today why , you understand !

<SOS> `` well , and what then ? '' <EOS>	80.79189513946709
<SOS> said fernand , lifting up his head , and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger ; `` mercédès is not accountable to any person , is she ? <EOS>	86.67093685744261
<SOS> is she not free to love whomsoever she will ? '' <EOS>	109.21767206631532
<SOS> `` oh , if you take it in that sense , '' said caderousse , `` it is another thing . <EOS>	73.0939243244076
<SOS> but i thought you were a catalan , and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival . <EOS>	71.30968136111504
<SOS> it was even told me that fernand , especially , was terrible in his vengeance . '' <EOS>	64.09901915255297
<SOS> fernand smiled piteously . <EOS>	91.24809460599181
<SOS> `` a lover is never terrible , '' he said . <EOS>	98.09498493245728
<SOS> `` poor fellow ! '' <EOS>	65.42492026189595
<SOS> remarked danglars , affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart . <EOS>	75.53965572265386
<SOS> `` why , you see , he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenly he thought he was dead , perhaps ; or perchance faithless ! <EOS>	85.05670101674316

<SOS> `` ah , ma foi , under any circumstances ! '' <EOS>	69.87101068550542
<SOS> said caderousse , who drank as he spoke , and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect , `` under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès ; is he , danglars ? '' <EOS>	89.31488283714758
<SOS> `` no , you are right and i should say that would bring him ill luck . '' <EOS>	62.1381668840341
<SOS> `` well , never mind , '' answered caderousse , pouring out a glass of wine for fernand , and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time , while danglars had merely sipped his . <EOS>	78.1696640791141
<SOS> `` never mind in the meantime he marries mercédès the lovely mercédès at least he returns to do that . '' <EOS>	97.00784475194517
<SOS> during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man , on whose heart caderousse 's words fell like molten lead . <EOS>	80.27776737175884
<SOS> `` and when is the wedding to be ? '' <EOS>	70.48978019024683

<SOS> murmured fernand . <EOS>	57.88586823812312
<SOS> `` no , but it will be , '' said caderousse , `` as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh , danglars ? '' <EOS>	100.1689179711422
<SOS> danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack , and turned to caderousse , whose countenance he scrutinized , to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated ; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness . <EOS>	81.56384634034438
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , filling the glasses , `` let us drink to captain edmond dantès , husband of the beautiful catalane ! '' <EOS>	60.15371475235808
<SOS> caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand , and swallowed the contents at a gulp . <EOS>	90.41459612742709
<SOS> fernand dashed his on the ground . <EOS>	109.9154112173246

<SOS> < num > m fernand , probably excited beyond bearing , pricked by danglars , as the bull is by the bandilleros , was about to rush out ; for he had risen from his seat , and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival , when mercédès , smiling and graceful , lifted up her lovely head , and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes . <EOS>	57.286501464956125
<SOS> at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died , and dropped again heavily on his seat . <EOS>	75.7939936631232
<SOS> danglars looked at the two men , one after the other , the one brutalized by liquor , the other overwhelmed with love . <EOS>	58.53481738917746
<SOS> `` i shall get nothing from these fools , '' he muttered ; `` and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward . <EOS>	47.20740397642805

<SOS> yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards , sicilians , and calabrians , and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow . <EOS>	63.70902695005097
<SOS> unquestionably , edmond 's star is in the ascendant , and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain , too , and laugh at us all , unless '' a sinister smile passed over danglars ' lips `` unless i take a hand in the affair , '' he added . <EOS>	79.15288486454251

<SOS> the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows , over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france ; beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house . <EOS>	65.0138706424754
<SOS> and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o'clock , an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests , consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon , and other personal friends of the bridegroom , the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes , in order to do greater honor to the occasion . <EOS>	51.78322124690196
<SOS> various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast ; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended . <EOS>	76.1624625224954
<SOS> danglars , however , who now made his appearance , accompanied by caderousse , effectually confirmed the report , stating that he had recently conversed with m. morrel , who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve . <EOS>	114.90098734721157
<SOS> in fact , a moment later m. morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon , who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship ; and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel , the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own . <EOS>	75.67091735148922
<SOS> with the entrance of m. morrel , danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation , and to beseech him to make haste . <EOS>	46.38155966040769
<SOS> danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed ; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them , composed of the betrothed pair , a party of young girls in attendance on the bride , by whose side walked dantès ' father ; the whole brought up by fernand , whose lips wore their usual sinister smile . <EOS>	65.2832275245592
<SOS> neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance ; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other . <EOS>	105.5631778670251
<SOS> having acquitted themselves of their errand , and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond , danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantès , the latter of whom attracted universal notice . <EOS>	63.38735711798284
<SOS> the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk , trimmed with steel buttons , beautifully cut and polished . <EOS>	81.63150256315905
<SOS> his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings , evidently of english manufacture , while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons . <EOS>	64.76263725226345
<SOS> thus he came along , supporting himself on a curiously carved stick , his aged countenance lit up with happiness , looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of < num > , parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries . <EOS>	103.09985830357103
<SOS> beside him glided caderousse , whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès , father and son , although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night ; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream . <EOS>	71.91768084960319
<SOS> < num > m as danglars approached the disappointed lover , he cast on him a look of deep meaning , while fernand , as he slowly paced behind the happy pair , who seemed , in their own unmixed content , to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed , was pale and abstracted ; occasionally , however , a deep flush would overspread his countenance , and a nervous contraction distort his features , while , with an agitated and restless gaze , he would glance in the direction of marseilles , like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event . <EOS>	71.3085821729282
<SOS> dantès himself was simply , but becomingly , clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb ; and with his fine countenance , radiant with joy and happiness , a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined . <EOS>	68.55815213887568
<SOS> lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios , mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet , and ripe , round , coral lips . <EOS>	75.57651326419314
<SOS> she moved with the light , free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian . <EOS>	91.28834847142181
<SOS> one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil , or , at least , have cast down her thickly fringed lashes , so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes ; but , on the contrary , the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say : `` if you are my friends , rejoice with me , for i am very happy . '' <EOS>	50.308815021607536
<SOS> as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve , m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it , followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled , to whom he had repeated the promise already given , that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere . <EOS>	57.972566642782226
<SOS> edmond , at the approach of his patron , respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m. morrel , who , forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared , was gayly followed by the guests , beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes . <EOS>	69.01015672930602
<SOS> `` father , '' said mercédès , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table , `` sit , i pray you , on my right hand ; on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , '' pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand ; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart . <EOS>	63.034726540213946
<SOS> during this time , dantès , at the opposite side of the table , had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests . <EOS>	42.37324114588656
<SOS> m. morrel was seated at his right hand , danglars at his left ; while , at a sign from edmond , the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable . <EOS>	90.87557304780121
<SOS> then they began to pass around the dusky , piquant , arlesian sausages , and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses , prawns of large size and brilliant color , the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within , the clovis , esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster , north . <EOS>	79.19357163079376
<SOS> all the delicacies , in fact , that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach , and styled by the grateful fishermen `` fruits of the sea . '' <EOS>	60.66279548196355
<SOS> `` a pretty silence truly ! '' <EOS>	114.21725825767498
<SOS> said the old father of the bridegroom , as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz , and which had just been placed before mercédès herself . <EOS>	82.972624622498
<SOS> `` now , would anybody think that this room contained a happy , merry party , who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ? '' <EOS>	73.89874302023264
<SOS> `` ah , '' sighed caderousse , `` a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married . '' <EOS>	90.5239189761028
<SOS> `` the truth is , '' replied dantès , `` that i am too happy for noisy mirth ; if that is what you meant by your observation , my worthy friend , you are right ; joy takes a strange effect at times , it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow . '' <EOS>	58.0514819512495
<SOS> danglars looked towards fernand , whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression . <EOS>	85.48238681655721
<SOS> `` why , what ails you ? '' <EOS>	74.45253880483146
<SOS> asked he of edmond . <EOS>	55.05154976205437
<SOS> `` do you fear any approaching evil ? <EOS>	82.25166661869629
<SOS> i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant . '' <EOS>	43.28666664059802
<SOS> `` and that is the very thing that alarms me , '' returned dantès . <EOS>	57.68807784171605
<SOS> `` man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed ; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood , where fierce , fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach ; and monsters of all shapes and kinds , requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours . <EOS>	83.46781062138322
<SOS> i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès . '' <EOS>	62.81683853579724
<SOS> `` nay , nay ! '' <EOS>	99.46417871305381
<SOS> cried caderousse , smiling , `` you have not attained that honor yet . <EOS>	86.17853197259993
<SOS> mercédès is not yet your wife . <EOS>	59.63486061580467
<SOS> just assume the tone and manner of a husband , and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come ! '' <EOS>	108.75363351440399
<SOS> the bride blushed , while fernand , restless and uneasy , seemed to start at every fresh sound , and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow . <EOS>	60.0690343761862
<SOS> `` well , never mind that , neighbor caderousse ; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that . <EOS>	44.15582218091522
<SOS> 't is true that mercédès is not actually my wife ; but , '' added he , drawing out his watch , `` in an hour and a half she will be . '' <EOS>	60.35504746638353
<SOS> a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table , with the exception of the elder dantès , whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth . <EOS>	68.49163872790479
<SOS> mercédès looked pleased and gratified , while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch . <EOS>	57.35186562029564
<SOS> `` in an hour ? '' <EOS>	48.99750796542956
<SOS> inquired danglars , turning pale . <EOS>	86.3190332832355
<SOS> `` how is that , my friend ? '' <EOS>	53.65610516273949
<SOS> `` why , thus it is , '' replied dantès . <EOS>	81.64528088699585
<SOS> `` thanks to the influence of m. morrel , to whom , next to my father , i owe every blessing i enjoy , every difficulty has been removed . <EOS>	84.81472792639498
<SOS> we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay ; and at half past two o'clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall . <EOS>	54.23410480506605
<SOS> now , as a quarter past one has already struck , i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying , that , in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès . '' <EOS>	92.47715572070295
<SOS> < num > m fernand closed his eyes , a burning sensation passed across his brow , and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair ; but in spite of all his efforts , he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan , which , however , was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company . <EOS>	111.882749452708
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' cried the old man , `` you make short work of this kind of affair . <EOS>	73.97443505897878
<SOS> arrived here only yesterday morning , and married today at three o'clock ! <EOS>	48.519556088164336
<SOS> commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work ! '' <EOS>	87.91738404779336
<SOS> `` but , '' asked danglars , in a timid tone , `` how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement ? '' <EOS>	104.48625893461062
<SOS> `` the contract , '' answered dantès , laughingly , `` it did n't take long to fix that . <EOS>	83.58090323299386
<SOS> mercédès has no fortune ; i have none to settle on her . <EOS>	62.2436738201308
<SOS> so , you see , our papers were quickly written out , and certainly do not come very expensive . '' <EOS>	69.07481076847607
<SOS> this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause . <EOS>	102.6576239673518
<SOS> `` so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner ! '' <EOS>	81.02478379298779
<SOS> said danglars . <EOS>	102.62967232032776
<SOS> `` no , no , '' answered dantès ; `` do n't imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner . <EOS>	67.24784138868657
<SOS> tomorrow morning i start for paris ; four days to go , and the same to return , with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me , is all the time i shall be absent . <EOS>	81.04141177634331
<SOS> i shall be back here by the first of march , and on the second i give my real marriage feast . '' <EOS>	74.49013972835066
<SOS> this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree , that the elder dantès , who , at the commencement of the repast , had commented upon the silence that prevailed , now found it difficult , amid the general din of voices , to obtain a moment 's tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom . <EOS>	50.804370256738714
<SOS> dantès , perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father , responded by a look of grateful pleasure ; while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond . <EOS>	43.90325432428052
<SOS> around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette . <EOS>	66.46684245249314
<SOS> such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously , and sought out more agreeable companions . <EOS>	74.87275834302928
<SOS> everybody talked at once , without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts . <EOS>	44.028345758668806
<SOS> fernand 's paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars . <EOS>	73.97959863514619
<SOS> as for fernand himself , he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned ; unable to rest , he was among the first to quit the table , and , as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds , he continued , in utter silence , to pace the farther end of the salon . <EOS>	42.75949379638311
<SOS> caderousse approached him just as danglars , whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid , had joined him in a corner of the room . <EOS>	59.12175733374486
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' said caderousse , from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès , united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of , had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès ' good fortune , `` upon my word , dantès is a downright good fellow , and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be . <EOS>	88.71934161979067
<SOS> i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday . '' <EOS>	77.96078561133685
<SOS> `` oh , there was no harm meant , '' answered danglars ; `` at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do ; but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings , even so far as to become one of his rival 's attendants , i knew there was no further cause for apprehension . '' <EOS>	91.58210313319238
<SOS> caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale . <EOS>	74.69851668365784
<SOS> `` certainly , '' continued danglars , `` the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned . <EOS>	89.38292788434192
<SOS> upon my soul , that future captain of mine is a lucky dog ! <EOS>	113.70414331955628
<SOS> gad ! <EOS>	52.26134043427851
<SOS> i only wish he would let me take his place . '' <EOS>	75.28582221356612
<SOS> `` shall we not set forth ? '' <EOS>	59.76000615182413
<SOS> asked the sweet , silvery voice of mercédès ; `` two o'clock has just struck , and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour . '' <EOS>	98.72273555399067
<SOS> < num > m `` to be sure ! <EOS>	54.5182723096947
<SOS> to be sure ! '' <EOS>	72.354543487698
<SOS> cried dantès , eagerly quitting the table ; `` let us go directly ! '' <EOS>	65.08953739753419
<SOS> his words were re echoed by the whole party , with vociferous cheers . <EOS>	98.94185256858935
<SOS> at this moment danglars , who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand 's look and manner , saw him stagger and fall back , with an almost convulsive spasm , against a seat placed near one of the open windows . <EOS>	44.94719497422838
<SOS> at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs , followed by the measured tread of soldiery , with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements ; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices , so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party , among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk , and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed . <EOS>	94.25507228688461
<SOS> the sounds drew nearer . <EOS>	92.38596471098786
<SOS> three blows were struck upon the panel of the door . <EOS>	95.6006565733501
<SOS> the company looked at each other in consternation . <EOS>	50.477052165265164
<SOS> `` i demand admittance , '' said a loud voice outside the room , `` in the name of the law ! '' <EOS>	114.45619929847194
<SOS> as no attempt was made to prevent it , the door was opened , and a magistrate , wearing his official scarf , presented himself , followed by four soldiers and a corporal . <EOS>	60.40516747890666
<SOS> uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present . <EOS>	51.05464659680665
<SOS> `` may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit ? '' <EOS>	59.48076562536102
<SOS> said m. morrel , addressing the magistrate , whom he evidently knew ; `` there is doubtless some mistake easily explained . '' <EOS>	69.68247756368477
<SOS> `` if it be so , '' replied the magistrate , `` rely upon every reparation being made ; meanwhile , i am the bearer of an order of arrest , and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me , it must , nevertheless , be fulfilled . <EOS>	57.98487066097702
<SOS> who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès ? '' <EOS>	73.2569747324113
<SOS> every eye was turned towards the young man who , spite of the agitation he could not but feel , advanced with dignity , and said , in a firm voice : `` i am he ; what is your pleasure with me ? '' <EOS>	96.49643985436687
<SOS> `` edmond dantès , '' replied the magistrate , `` i arrest you in the name of the law ! '' <EOS>	86.8517926072454
<SOS> `` me ! '' <EOS>	47.05972311720434
<SOS> repeated edmond , slightly changing color , `` and wherefore , i pray ? '' <EOS>	80.01586678132686
<SOS> `` i can not inform you , but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination . '' <EOS>	70.08748734785543
<SOS> m. morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless . <EOS>	67.53549777745097
<SOS> he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law , and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf , as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy . <EOS>	44.641467776928444
<SOS> old dantès , however , sprang forward . <EOS>	83.11786324303225
<SOS> there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand . <EOS>	101.97063746482428
<SOS> he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving , that even the officer was touched , and , although firm in his duty , he kindly said , `` my worthy friend , let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions . <EOS>	71.15111314037493
<SOS> your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo , and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required , whether touching the health of his crew , or the value of his freight . '' <EOS>	58.21364850268384
<SOS> `` what is the meaning of all this ? '' <EOS>	58.69786952242012
<SOS> inquired caderousse , frowningly , of danglars , who had assumed an air of utter surprise . <EOS>	96.39131113974771
<SOS> < num > m `` how can i tell you ? '' <EOS>	84.28392482462965
<SOS> replied he ; `` i am , like yourself , utterly bewildered at all that is going on , and can not in the least make out what it is about . '' <EOS>	73.25072638927192
<SOS> caderousse then looked around for fernand , but he had disappeared . <EOS>	55.780068887212224
<SOS> the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness . <EOS>	100.63682225086032
<SOS> the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory . <EOS>	40.17030966911056
<SOS> `` so , so , '' said he , in a hoarse and choking voice , to danglars , `` this , then , i suppose , is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday ? <EOS>	78.32420921059398
<SOS> all i can say is , that if it be so , 't is an ill turn , and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it . '' <EOS>	49.203409503903266
<SOS> `` nonsense , '' returned danglars , `` i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it ; besides , you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces . '' <EOS>	68.10434182561956
<SOS> `` no , you did not ! '' <EOS>	54.59413480840326
<SOS> answered caderousse , `` you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner . '' <EOS>	102.75232998421247
<SOS> `` hold your tongue , you fool ! <EOS>	73.87285890227726
<SOS> what should you know about it ? <EOS>	81.588448724132
<SOS> why , you were drunk ! '' <EOS>	87.06662298536102
<SOS> `` where is fernand ? '' <EOS>	79.13212206203592
<SOS> inquired caderousse . <EOS>	103.22910158825191
<SOS> `` how do i know ? '' <EOS>	81.73376787933002
<SOS> replied danglars ; `` gone , as every prudent man ought to be , to look after his own affairs , most likely . <EOS>	73.91341227591403
<SOS> never mind where he is , let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends . '' <EOS>	66.70193053172956
<SOS> during this conversation , dantès , after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends , had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him , merely saying , `` make yourselves quite easy , my good fellows , there is some little mistake to clear up , that 's all , depend upon it ; and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that . '' <EOS>	85.08689102950683
<SOS> < num > m `` oh , to be sure ! '' <EOS>	87.44399872762219
<SOS> responded danglars , who had now approached the group , `` nothing more than a mistake , i feel quite certain . '' <EOS>	58.45966367142564
<SOS> dantès descended the staircase , preceded by the magistrate , and followed by the soldiers . <EOS>	65.07765643648705
<SOS> a carriage awaited him at the door ; he got in , followed by two soldiers and the magistrate , and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles . <EOS>	75.74846478090359
<SOS> `` adieu , adieu , dearest edmond ! '' <EOS>	75.84453694355425
<SOS> cried mercédès , stretching out her arms to him from the balcony . <EOS>	52.713116212706986
<SOS> the prisoner heard the cry , which sounded like the sob of a broken heart , and leaning from the coach he called out , `` good bye , mercédès we shall soon meet again ! '' <EOS>	96.78486373749206
<SOS> then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas . <EOS>	81.82618592446498
<SOS> `` wait for me here , all of you ! '' <EOS>	75.21499618644691
<SOS> cried m. morrel ; `` i will take the first conveyance i find , and hurry to marseilles , whence i will bring you word how all is going on . '' <EOS>	102.24388770143827
<SOS> `` that 's right ! '' <EOS>	68.78589054168144
<SOS> exclaimed a multitude of voices , `` go , and return as quickly as you can ! '' <EOS>	95.64778432636284
<SOS> this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind . <EOS>	103.14315021024528
<SOS> the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart , each absorbed in grief ; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes , and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other 's arms . <EOS>	63.28227393329954
<SOS> meanwhile fernand made his appearance , poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand ; then hastily swallowing it , went to sit down at the first vacant place , and this was , by mere chance , placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting , when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès . <EOS>	54.47020017483597
<SOS> instinctively fernand drew back his chair . <EOS>	94.88036012629667
<SOS> `` he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it , '' whispered caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off fernand , to danglars . <EOS>	102.4351668787525
<SOS> `` i do n't think so , '' answered the other ; `` he 's too stupid to imagine such a scheme . <EOS>	45.46872814096559
<SOS> i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it . '' <EOS>	70.14714731163902
<SOS> `` you do n't mention those who aided and abetted the deed , '' said caderousse . <EOS>	73.64331731996178
<SOS> `` surely , '' answered danglars , `` one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air . '' <EOS>	109.3226496822427
<SOS> `` you can , indeed , when the arrow lights point downward on somebody 's head . '' <EOS>	79.5807581824344
<SOS> meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form . <EOS>	76.64608591765449
<SOS> `` what think you , danglars , '' said one of the party , turning towards him , `` of this event ? '' <EOS>	76.63622800380593
<SOS> `` why , '' replied he , `` i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband . '' <EOS>	92.71051383980554
<SOS> `` but how could he have done so without your knowledge , danglars , since you are the ship 's supercargo ? '' <EOS>	95.83637621480058
<SOS> `` why , as for that , i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden . <EOS>	71.91764026908773
<SOS> i know she was loaded with cotton , and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret 's warehouse , and at smyrna from pascal 's ; that is all i was obliged to know , and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars . '' <EOS>	38.64553955058858
<SOS> `` now i recollect , '' said the afflicted old father ; `` my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee , and another of tobacco for me ! '' <EOS>	62.922692791117036
<SOS> `` there , you see , '' exclaimed danglars . <EOS>	53.93547250913642
<SOS> `` now the mischief is out ; depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence , and discovered poor dantès ' hidden treasures . '' <EOS>	92.66507270442825
<SOS> mercédès , however , paid no heed to this explanation of her lover 's arrest . <EOS>	105.71852690934614
<SOS> her grief , which she had hitherto tried to restrain , now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing . <EOS>	70.8391453322379
<SOS> `` come , come , '' said the old man , `` be comforted , my poor child ; there is still hope ! '' <EOS>	61.95456354488251
<SOS> `` hope ! '' <EOS>	83.5234615438069
<SOS> repeated danglars . <EOS>	91.51686052906206
<SOS> `` hope ! '' <EOS>	86.79217507030198
<SOS> faintly murmured fernand , but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips , and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance . <EOS>	100.72859595478519
<SOS> `` good news ! <EOS>	53.55813600468057
<SOS> good news ! '' <EOS>	62.87658968685876
<SOS> shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout . <EOS>	82.65484725414512
<SOS> `` here comes m. morrel back . <EOS>	80.0152077908731
<SOS> no doubt , now , we shall hear that our friend is released ! '' <EOS>	65.01405290211713
<SOS> mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door . <EOS>	95.40568464283439
<SOS> he was very pale . <EOS>	73.25248687108503
<SOS> `` what news ? '' <EOS>	66.35845904728993
<SOS> exclaimed a general burst of voices . <EOS>	59.19412117814511
<SOS> `` alas , my friends , '' replied m. morrel , with a mournful shake of his head , `` the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected . '' <EOS>	83.20251063611711
<SOS> `` oh , indeed indeed , sir , he is innocent ! '' <EOS>	78.43479296055037
<SOS> sobbed forth mercédès . <EOS>	119.3727766392887
<SOS> `` that i believe ! '' <EOS>	110.29483378814876
<SOS> answered m. morrel ; `` but still he is charged `` `` with what ? '' <EOS>	109.0973664933887
<SOS> inquired the elder dantès . <EOS>	47.346256971750584
<SOS> `` with being an agent of the bonapartist faction ! '' <EOS>	75.00022817626157
<SOS> many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated . <EOS>	86.66387810312077
<SOS> a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès ; the old man sank into a chair . <EOS>	87.61108125744374
<SOS> `` ah , danglars ! '' <EOS>	85.23573610590445
<SOS> whispered caderousse , `` you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played ; but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault . <EOS>	84.89764391971953
<SOS> i am determined to tell them all about it . '' <EOS>	53.9939693220034
<SOS> `` be silent , you simpleton ! '' <EOS>	82.75094087008506
<SOS> cried danglars , grasping him by the arm , `` or i will not answer even for your own safety . <EOS>	44.28264065246589
<SOS> who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty ? <EOS>	104.10702468988973
<SOS> the vessel did touch at elba , where he quitted it , and passed a whole day in the island . <EOS>	67.53165057822929
<SOS> now , should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him , will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices ? '' <EOS>	55.93772514053552
<SOS> with the rapid instinct of selfishness , caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning ; he gazed , doubtfully , wistfully , on danglars , and then caution supplanted generosity . <EOS>	53.94837382641212
<SOS> `` suppose we wait a while , and see what comes of it , '' said he , casting a bewildered look on his companion . <EOS>	81.86121894533053
<SOS> `` to be sure ! '' <EOS>	59.48330217902731
<SOS> answered danglars . <EOS>	111.62072415811282
<SOS> `` let us wait , by all means . <EOS>	67.59039332913878
<SOS> if he be innocent , of course he will be set at liberty ; if guilty , why , it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy . '' <EOS>	78.60234469905491
<SOS> `` let us go , then . <EOS>	90.62789875357315
<SOS> i can not stay here any longer . '' <EOS>	66.64482841334667
<SOS> `` with all my heart ! '' <EOS>	58.57305303952879
<SOS> replied danglars , pleased to find the other so tractable . <EOS>	40.543746010811375
<SOS> `` let us take ourselves out of the way , and leave things for the present to take their course . '' <EOS>	44.50753444722293
<SOS> after their departure , fernand , who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès , led the girl to her home , while some friends of dantès conducted his father , nearly lifeless , to the allées de meilhan . <EOS>	56.33655645138019
<SOS> the rumor of edmond 's arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city . <EOS>	100.16041193904267
<SOS> `` could you ever have credited such a thing , my dear danglars ? '' <EOS>	114.00557936756611
<SOS> asked m. morrel , as , on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès , from m. de villefort , the assistant procureur , he overtook his supercargo and caderousse . <EOS>	44.54719556903481
<SOS> `` could you have believed such a thing possible ? '' <EOS>	79.58456558825556
<SOS> `` why , you know i told you , '' replied danglars , `` that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance . '' <EOS>	52.31975002623248
<SOS> `` and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself ? '' <EOS>	74.15872053779309
<SOS> < num > m `` certainly not ! '' <EOS>	55.05743268032998
<SOS> returned danglars . <EOS>	67.62614309773251
<SOS> then added in a low whisper , `` you understand that , on account of your uncle , m. policar morrel , who served under the other government , and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject , you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon . <EOS>	60.58343705079783
<SOS> i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself , had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul . <EOS>	46.33625598420184
<SOS> i am too well aware that though a subordinate , like myself , is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs , there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else . '' <EOS>	56.24736577825344
<SOS> `` 't is well , danglars 't is well ! '' <EOS>	81.16128739400123
<SOS> replied m. morrel . <EOS>	70.59364198598213
<SOS> `` you are a worthy fellow ; and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon . '' <EOS>	112.18642281079356
<SOS> `` is it possible you were so kind ? '' <EOS>	68.03520733492446
<SOS> `` yes , indeed ; i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you , and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post , for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you . '' <EOS>	82.95205979208136
<SOS> `` and what was his reply ? '' <EOS>	81.28631679622438
<SOS> `` that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars , but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship 's owners would have his preference also . '' <EOS>	63.804015030267394
<SOS> `` the hypocrite ! '' <EOS>	42.41726353826527
<SOS> murmured danglars . <EOS>	75.11817043534509
<SOS> `` poor dantès ! '' <EOS>	65.68974628024205
<SOS> said caderousse . <EOS>	73.65930561113187
<SOS> `` no one can deny his being a noble hearted young fellow . '' <EOS>	84.06679839951266
<SOS> `` but meanwhile , '' continued m. morrel , `` here is the pharaon without a captain . '' <EOS>	58.17736141105377
<SOS> `` oh , '' replied danglars , `` since we can not leave this port for the next three months , let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at liberty . '' <EOS>	60.8353452730676
<SOS> `` no doubt ; but in the meantime ? '' <EOS>	72.26293159947863
<SOS> `` i am entirely at your service , m. morrel , '' answered danglars . <EOS>	79.4476979631314
<SOS> `` you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service ; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services , that upon edmond 's release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts . '' <EOS>	60.05650222956005
<SOS> `` thanks , danglars that will smooth over all difficulties . <EOS>	82.57083525683319
<SOS> i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon , and look carefully to the unloading of her freight . <EOS>	53.1533278895039
<SOS> private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business . '' <EOS>	85.6176177685723
<SOS> `` be easy on that score , m. morrel ; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond ? '' <EOS>	101.28155257121665
<SOS> `` i will let you know that directly i have seen m. de villefort , whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond 's favor . <EOS>	73.69566423459923
<SOS> i am aware he is a furious royalist ; but , in spite of that , and of his being king 's attorney , he is a man like ourselves , and i fancy not a bad sort of one . '' <EOS>	91.65823212055876
<SOS> `` perhaps not , '' replied danglars ; `` but i hear that he is ambitious , and that 's rather against him . '' <EOS>	44.99362420399153
<SOS> `` well , well , '' returned m. morrel , `` we shall see . <EOS>	90.4991181393489
<SOS> but now hasten on board , i will join you there ere long . '' <EOS>	90.14705711912536
<SOS> so saying , the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies , and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice . <EOS>	63.44372365849266
<SOS> < num > m `` you see , '' said danglars , addressing caderousse , `` the turn things have taken . <EOS>	58.944004989009656
<SOS> do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence ? '' <EOS>	96.27154424907933
<SOS> `` not the slightest , but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences . '' <EOS>	70.02619507788674
<SOS> `` but who perpetrated that joke , let me ask ? <EOS>	46.82358972531602
<SOS> neither you nor myself , but fernand ; you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed , i fancied i had destroyed it . '' <EOS>	105.1717403091108
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' replied caderousse , `` that i can answer for , you did not . <EOS>	57.03333939809197
<SOS> i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor . '' <EOS>	52.58964716998516
<SOS> `` well , then , if you did , depend upon it , fernand picked it up , and either copied it or caused it to be copied ; perhaps , even , he did not take the trouble of recopying it . <EOS>	87.75132605094016
<SOS> and now i think of it , by heavens , he may have sent the letter itself ! <EOS>	72.74195856929714
<SOS> fortunately , for me , the handwriting was disguised . '' <EOS>	42.84377329675243
<SOS> `` then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy ? '' <EOS>	87.3129366174469
<SOS> `` not i . <EOS>	85.0330273349655
<SOS> as i before said , i thought the whole thing was a joke , nothing more . <EOS>	42.416956422431184
<SOS> it seems , however , that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth . '' <EOS>	54.07553326277826
<SOS> `` still , '' argued caderousse , `` i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened ; or , at least , that i had had no hand in it . <EOS>	59.18856376440215
<SOS> you will see , danglars , that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us . '' <EOS>	77.10406132948303
<SOS> `` nonsense ! <EOS>	71.76676477825849
<SOS> if any harm come of it , it should fall on the guilty person ; and that , you know , is fernand . <EOS>	52.39875908458556
<SOS> how can we be implicated in any way ? <EOS>	79.78775639532283
<SOS> all we have got to do is , to keep our own counsel , and remain perfectly quiet , not breathing a word to any living soul ; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us . '' <EOS>	107.0300292397849
<SOS> `` amen ! '' <EOS>	67.88738561233498
<SOS> responded caderousse , waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars , and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan , moving his head to and fro , and muttering as he went , after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea . <EOS>	70.53118640604319
<SOS> `` so far , then , '' said danglars , mentally , `` all has gone as i would have it . <EOS>	114.81059372492099
<SOS> i am , temporarily , commander of the pharaon , with the certainty of being permanently so , if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue . <EOS>	80.67105501194685
<SOS> my only fear is the chance of dantès being released . <EOS>	62.10796383673131
<SOS> but , there , he is in the hands of justice ; and , '' added he with a smile , `` she will take her own . '' <EOS>	69.54093449320747
<SOS> so saying , he leaped into a boat , desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon , where m. morrel had agreed to meet him . <EOS>	93.72380781929836

<SOS> the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain , a second marriage feast was being celebrated , almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dantès . <EOS>	58.6372312209472
<SOS> in this case , however , although the occasion of the entertainment was similar , the company was strikingly dissimilar . <EOS>	48.11253497957973
<SOS> instead of a rude mixture of sailors , soldiers , and those belonging to the humblest grade of life , the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society , magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper 's reign ; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé ; and younger members of families , brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr , and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god . <EOS>	93.04732898802366
<SOS> the guests were still at table , and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south , where unhappily , for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling . <EOS>	73.63754479219376
<SOS> the emperor , now king of the petty island of elba , after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world , counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls , after having been accustomed to hear the `` vive napoléons `` of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings , uttered in ten different languages , was looked upon here as a ruined man , separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne . <EOS>	89.15966691333416
<SOS> the magistrates freely discussed their political views ; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic , while the women commented on the divorce of josephine . <EOS>	55.88239717450898
<SOS> it was not over the downfall of the man , but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea , that they rejoiced , and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence . <EOS>	75.55825670800037
<SOS> an old man , decorated with the cross of saint louis , now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii . <EOS>	48.05466033614615
<SOS> it was the marquis de saint méran . <EOS>	75.15507100928367
<SOS> this toast , recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france , excited universal enthusiasm ; glasses were elevated in the air à l'anglaise , and the ladies , snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms , strewed the table with their floral treasures . <EOS>	52.8169647809455
<SOS> in a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed . <EOS>	75.7034988322002
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the marquise de saint méran , a woman with a stern , forbidding eye , though still noble and distinguished in appearance , despite her fifty years `` ah , these revolutionists , who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror , would be compelled to own , were they here , that all true devotion was on our side , since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch , while they , on the contrary , made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun ; yes , yes , they could not help admitting that the king , for whom we sacrificed rank , wealth , and station was truly our 'louis the well beloved , ' while their wretched usurper has been , and ever will be , to them their evil genius , their 'napoleon the accursed .

<SOS> `` marquise , marquise ! '' <EOS>	96.1044674099836

<SOS> `` never mind , dearest mother , '' said a young and lovely girl , with a profusion of light brown hair , and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal , `` 't is all my fault for seizing upon m. de villefort , so as to prevent his listening to what you said . <EOS>	61.341324399368126

<SOS> `` never mind , renée , '' replied the marquise , with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features ; but , however all other feelings may be withered in a woman 's nature , there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart , and that is the shrine of maternal love . <EOS>	55.70573219564876
<SOS> `` i forgive you . <EOS>	73.33575100859798
<SOS> what i was saying , villefort , was , that the bonapartists had not our sincerity , enthusiasm , or devotion . '' <EOS>	92.6508117234561
<SOS> `` they had , however , what supplied the place of those fine qualities , '' replied the young man , `` and that was fanaticism . <EOS>	89.37219849065609

<SOS> the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men ; one is the equality that elevates , the other is the equality that degrades ; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine , the other elevates the people to a level with the throne . <EOS>	60.435158138645676
<SOS> observe , '' said villefort , smiling , `` i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels , and that the < num > th thermidor and the < num > th of april , in the year < num > , were lucky days for france , worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order ; and that explains how it comes to pass that , fallen , as i trust he is forever , napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites . <EOS>	99.08385408725303
<SOS> still , marquise , it has been so with other usurpers cromwell , for instance , who was not half so bad as napoleon , had his partisans and advocates . '' <EOS>	77.3923444006599

<SOS> a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort . <EOS>	79.68572591946138
<SOS> `` 't is true , madame , '' answered he , `` that my father was a girondin , but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king 's death ; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror , and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished . '' <EOS>	39.41837233159901
<SOS> `` true , '' replied the marquise , without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up ; `` but bear in mind , if you please , that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles ; in proof of which i may remark , that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes , your father lost no time in joining the new government ; and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin , the count noirtier became a senator .

<SOS> `` alas , madame , '' returned villefort , `` my profession , as well as the times in which we live , compels me to be severe . <EOS>	55.05371942234428

<SOS> inquired the marquise . <EOS>	87.25977922091582
<SOS> `` i am , at least , fearful of it . <EOS>	59.62815455668985
<SOS> napoleon , in the island of elba , is too near france , and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans . <EOS>	81.54210321592116

<SOS> `` you have heard , perhaps , '' said the comte de salvieux , one of m. de saint méran 's oldest friends , and chamberlain to the comte d'artois , `` that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence ? '' <EOS>	77.25139079044077

<SOS> `` an island situated on the other side of the equator , at least two thousand leagues from here , '' replied the count . <EOS>	101.81544176463342
<SOS> `` so much the better . <EOS>	72.6999162000039

<SOS> `` unfortunately , '' said villefort , `` there are the treaties of < num > , and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts . '' <EOS>	70.61783755011801
<SOS> `` oh , well , we shall find some way out of it , '' responded m. de salvieux . <EOS>	57.315220324848575

<SOS> `` well , '' said the marquise , `` it seems probable that , by the aid of the holy alliance , we shall be rid of napoleon ; and we must trust to the vigilance of m. de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans . <EOS>	87.84352259567348
<SOS> the king is either a king or no king ; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france , he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity ; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy 't is the best and surest means of preventing mischief .

<SOS> `` unfortunately , madame , '' answered villefort , `` the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place . '' <EOS>	83.617143983922
<SOS> `` then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it . '' <EOS>	76.12186673712986
<SOS> `` nay , madame , the law is frequently powerless to effect this ; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done . '' <EOS>	91.17563622402606

<SOS> i never was in a law court ; i am told it is so very amusing ! '' <EOS>	114.40183337451401
<SOS> `` amusing , certainly , '' replied the young man , `` inasmuch as , instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre , you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life . <EOS>	44.31906935535377

<SOS> `` what would you have ? <EOS>	47.31674874562755

<SOS> `` gracious heavens , m. de villefort , '' said renée , becoming more and more terrified ; `` you surely are not in earnest . '' <EOS>	55.39343905417098
<SOS> `` indeed i am , '' replied the young magistrate with a smile ; `` and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness , the case would only be still more aggravated . <EOS>	70.51734925329045
<SOS> suppose , for instance , the prisoner , as is more than probable , to have served under napoleon well , can you expect for an instant , that one accustomed , at the word of his commander , to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe , will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy , than to slaughter his fellow creatures , merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey ? <EOS>	94.03584066616317

<SOS> i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile , as though in mockery of my words . <EOS>	75.24135817935262
<SOS> no ; my pride is to see the accused pale , agitated , and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence . '' <EOS>	95.6409036133198
<SOS> renée uttered a smothered exclamation . <EOS>	84.04968888675151
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	58.50099512742101
<SOS> cried one of the guests ; `` that is what i call talking to some purpose . '' <EOS>	88.62947591256565

<SOS> `` what a splendid business that last case of yours was , my dear villefort ! '' <EOS>	98.40478830056644
<SOS> remarked a third ; `` i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father . <EOS>	81.84379745163946

<SOS> `` oh , as for parricides , and such dreadful people as that , '' interposed renée , `` it matters very little what is done to them ; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues `` `` why , that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit ; for , do n't you see , renée , the king is the father of his people , and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls , is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale ? '' <EOS>	53.73220692717033
<SOS> `` i do n't know anything about that , '' replied renée ; `` but , m. de villefort , you have promised me have you not ? <EOS>	70.02659312790489

<SOS> there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point . '' <EOS>	41.95687291589213
<SOS> `` cedant arma togæ , '' said villefort with a bow . <EOS>	108.7094447432679
<SOS> `` i can not speak latin , '' responded the marquise . <EOS>	83.65947276339749
<SOS> `` well , '' said renée , `` i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician , for instance . <EOS>	49.02831796284172
<SOS> do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel ? '' <EOS>	74.4782077930338
<SOS> `` dear , good renée , '' whispered villefort , as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker . <EOS>	62.72405321204003
<SOS> `` let us hope , my child , '' cried the marquis , `` that m. de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province ; if so , he will have achieved a noble work . '' <EOS>	90.7775640751984
<SOS> `` and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father 's conduct , '' added the incorrigible marquise . <EOS>	78.3725006449959
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied villefort , with a mournful smile , `` i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least , i hope so abjured his past errors , and that he is , at the present moment , a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist , possibly , than his son ; for he has to atone for past dereliction , while i have no other impulse than warm , decided preference and conviction . '' <EOS>	46.955135107515495
<SOS> having made this well turned speech , villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory , much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court . <EOS>	103.07676739619168
<SOS> `` do you know , my dear villefort , '' cried the comte de salvieux , `` that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries , when questioned by his majesty 's principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé ; and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles . <EOS>	52.57591438679925
<SOS> then the king , who , without our suspecting it , had overheard our conversation , interrupted us by saying , 'villefort ' observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier , but , on the contrary , placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort 'villefort , ' said his majesty , 'is a young man of great judgment and discretion , who will be sure to make a figure in his profession ; i like him much , and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran . <EOS>	70.31062444345716
<SOS> i should myself have recommended the match , had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it . ' '' <EOS>	90.08972163082797
<SOS> `` is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me ? '' <EOS>	47.69152036675835
<SOS> asked the enraptured villefort . <EOS>	88.37863814641719
<SOS> `` i give you his very words ; and if the marquis chooses to be candid , he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him , when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter . '' <EOS>	111.16354351461892
<SOS> < num > m `` that is true , '' answered the marquis . <EOS>	56.50004086914824
<SOS> `` how much do i owe this gracious prince ! <EOS>	50.7416850502719
<SOS> what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude ! '' <EOS>	75.83141418988427
<SOS> `` that is right , '' cried the marquise . <EOS>	79.60962979505625
<SOS> `` i love to see you thus . <EOS>	80.92757615087586

<SOS> `` for my part , dear mother , '' interposed renée , `` i trust your wishes will not prosper , and that providence will only permit petty offenders , poor debtors , and miserable cheats to fall into m. de villefort 's hands , then i shall be contented . '' <EOS>	67.89284427477733
<SOS> `` just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches , measles , and the stings of wasps , or any other slight affection of the epidermis . <EOS>	58.658271024697584

<SOS> at this moment , and as though the utterance of villefort 's wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment , a servant entered the room , and whispered a few words in his ear . <EOS>	71.01875488700796
<SOS> villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business ; he soon , however , returned , his whole face beaming with delight . <EOS>	41.71815431159231
<SOS> renée regarded him with fond affection ; and certainly his handsome features , lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation , seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover . <EOS>	81.06475573571753
<SOS> `` you were wishing just now , '' said villefort , addressing her , `` that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer . <EOS>	74.16986569398978

<SOS> `` and wherefore were you called away just now ? '' <EOS>	89.08055873580595
<SOS> asked mademoiselle de saint méran , with an air of deep interest . <EOS>	71.58530977063029
<SOS> `` for a very serious matter , which bids fair to make work for the executioner . '' <EOS>	58.229733407084545
<SOS> `` how dreadful ! '' <EOS>	84.08255335643675
<SOS> exclaimed renée , turning pale . <EOS>	70.61488314259493
<SOS> `` is it possible ? '' <EOS>	75.19380471589477
<SOS> burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words . <EOS>	54.50924668024288
<SOS> `` why , if my information prove correct , a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered . '' <EOS>	61.4089219170142

<SOS> cried the marquise . <EOS>	70.36347625253342
<SOS> `` i will read you the letter containing the accusation , at least , '' said villefort : `` 'the king 's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country , that one named edmond dantès , mate of the ship pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper , and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris . <EOS>	79.72147504795736

<SOS> `` he is in safe custody , '' answered villefort ; `` and rely upon it , if the letter is found , he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again , unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman . '' <EOS>	64.19949418571873

<SOS> `` come , come , my friend , '' interrupted the marquise , `` do not neglect your duty to linger with us . <EOS>	65.78494838754979

<SOS> `` oh , villefort ! '' <EOS>	64.36115474128219
<SOS> cried renée , clasping her hands , and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness , `` be merciful on this the day of our betrothal . '' <EOS>	90.57763749055763
<SOS> the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat , and leaning over her chair said tenderly : `` to give you pleasure , my sweet renée , i promise to show all the lenity in my power ; but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct , why , then , you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off .

<SOS> so saying , madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort , who , while imprinting a son in law 's respectful salute on it , looked at renée , as much as to say , `` i must try and fancy 't is your dear hand i kiss , as it should have been . '' <EOS>	80.94950616040911
<SOS> `` these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal , '' sighed poor renée . <EOS>	92.31166592435608
<SOS> `` upon my word , child ! '' <EOS>	99.09988809351947
<SOS> exclaimed the angry marquise , `` your folly exceeds all bounds . <EOS>	106.80228187052246
<SOS> i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state ! '' <EOS>	68.95262512801784
<SOS> `` oh , mother ! '' <EOS>	53.65354079738673
<SOS> murmured renée . <EOS>	62.86081271954666
<SOS> `` nay , madame , i pray you pardon this little traitor . <EOS>	78.1142434827157
<SOS> i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty , i will be most inflexibly severe ; '' then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed , which seemed to say , `` fear not , for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy , '' and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return , villefort departed with paradise in his heart . <EOS>	68.7932698708224
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	106.98455921300483
<SOS> the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon , than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands . <EOS>	71.05414374050802
<SOS> now , in spite of the nobility of his countenance , the command of which , like a finished actor , he had carefully studied before the glass , it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity . <EOS>	75.273677835782
<SOS> except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted , and which might interfere , unless he acted with the greatest prudence , with his own career , gérard de villefort was as happy as a man could be . <EOS>	58.27847322921776
<SOS> already rich , he held a high official situation , though only twenty seven . <EOS>	65.3966956744266
<SOS> he was about to marry a young and charming woman , whom he loved , not passionately , but reasonably , as became a deputy attorney of the king ; and besides her personal attractions , which were very great , mademoiselle de saint méran 's family possessed considerable political influence , which they would , of course , exert in his favor . <EOS>	77.95026552520271
<SOS> the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father 's death . <EOS>	68.79448987585323
<SOS> these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation . <EOS>	55.376491607183915
<SOS> at the door he met the commissary of police , who was waiting for him . <EOS>	86.37213514326463
<SOS> the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth ; he composed his face , as we have before described , and said , `` i have read the letter , sir , and you have acted rightly in arresting this man ; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy . '' <EOS>	65.83258028039337
<SOS> `` we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy , monsieur ; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk . <EOS>	74.60416012071809
<SOS> the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès , mate on board the three master the pharaon , trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna , and belonging to morrel & son , of marseilles . '' <EOS>	82.99394775641542
<SOS> `` before he entered the merchant service , had he ever served in the marines ? '' <EOS>	64.936454793844
<SOS> `` oh , no , monsieur , he is very young . '' <EOS>	108.85315452990884
<SOS> `` how old ? '' <EOS>	99.42003624066498
<SOS> `` nineteen or twenty at the most . '' <EOS>	104.50912453046399
<SOS> at this moment , and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils , a man , who seemed to have been waiting for him , approached ; it was m. morrel . <EOS>	62.88351250610364
<SOS> `` ah , m. de villefort , '' cried he , `` i am delighted to see you . <EOS>	45.89826205504194
<SOS> some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès , mate of my vessel . '' <EOS>	75.67057819523394
<SOS> `` i know it , monsieur , '' replied villefort , `` and i am now going to examine him . '' <EOS>	92.59472830002498
<SOS> `` oh , '' said morrel , carried away by his friendship , `` you do not know him , and i do . <EOS>	55.729143511782205
<SOS> he is the most estimable , the most trustworthy creature in the world , and i will venture to say , there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service . <EOS>	111.78818858041426
<SOS> oh , m. de villefort , i beseech your indulgence for him . '' <EOS>	74.49334805365618
<SOS> villefort , as we have seen , belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles , morrel to the plebeian ; the first was a royalist , the other suspected of bonapartism . <EOS>	42.03449165688301
<SOS> villefort looked disdainfully at morrel , and replied coldly : `` you are aware , monsieur , that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life , and the best seaman in the merchant service , and yet be , politically speaking , a great criminal . <EOS>	80.75045995176977
<SOS> is it not true ? '' <EOS>	75.50439027395622
<SOS> the magistrate laid emphasis on these words , as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself , while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who , interceding for another , had himself need of indulgence . <EOS>	112.48623607724494
<SOS> morrel reddened , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him . <EOS>	48.41818109698816
<SOS> he replied , however , in a tone of deep interest : `` i entreat you , m. de villefort , be , as you always are , kind and equitable , and give him back to us soon . '' <EOS>	78.83117360534436
<SOS> this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy 's ears . <EOS>	68.75731304015292
<SOS> `` ah , ah , '' murmured he , `` is dantès then a member of some carbonari society , that his protector thus employs the collective form ? <EOS>	117.29153235122727
<SOS> he was , if i recollect , arrested in a tavern , in company with a great many others . '' <EOS>	64.74019465747183
<SOS> then he added , `` monsieur , you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially , and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain ; should he , however , be guilty , in this present epoch , impunity would furnish a dangerous example , and i must do my duty . '' <EOS>	61.66111957702309
<SOS> < num > m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house , which adjoined the palais de justice , he entered , after having , coldly saluted the shipowner , who stood , as if petrified , on the spot where villefort had left him . <EOS>	105.14341515378526
<SOS> the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes , in the midst of whom , carefully watched , but calm and smiling , stood the prisoner . <EOS>	60.25307517969364
<SOS> villefort traversed the antechamber , cast a side glance at dantès , and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him , disappeared , saying , `` bring in the prisoner . '' <EOS>	54.43605102318758
<SOS> rapid as had been villefort 's glance , it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate . <EOS>	45.53187699167937
<SOS> he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead , courage in the dark eye and bent brow , and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth . <EOS>	96.02158018593241
<SOS> villefort 's first impression was favorable ; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses , that he applied the maxim to the impression , forgetting the difference between the two words . <EOS>	87.13259298577597
<SOS> he stifled , therefore , the feelings of compassion that were rising , composed his features , and sat down , grim and sombre , at his desk . <EOS>	61.78555624905932
<SOS> an instant after dantès entered . <EOS>	97.19920965294344
<SOS> he was pale , but calm and collected , and saluting his judge with easy politeness , looked round for a seat , as if he had been in m. morrel 's salon . <EOS>	93.06735688891833
<SOS> it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort 's look , that look peculiar to the magistrate , who , while seeming to read the thoughts of others , betrays nothing of his own . <EOS>	113.18532672338927
<SOS> `` who and what are you ? '' <EOS>	42.25432553352063
<SOS> demanded villefort , turning over a pile of papers , containing information relative to the prisoner , that a police agent had given to him on his entry , and that , already , in an hour 's time , had swelled to voluminous proportions , thanks to the corrupt espionage of which `` the accused '' is always made the victim . <EOS>	60.051082216332816
<SOS> `` my name is edmond dantès , '' replied the young man calmly ; `` i am mate of the pharaon , belonging to messrs. morrel & son . '' <EOS>	55.60694967878599
<SOS> `` your age ? '' <EOS>	64.99935688514883
<SOS> continued villefort . <EOS>	97.80803142020478
<SOS> `` nineteen , '' returned dantès . <EOS>	96.94154860917965
<SOS> `` what were you doing at the moment you were arrested ? '' <EOS>	66.6957255173699
<SOS> `` i was at the festival of my marriage , monsieur , '' said the young man , his voice slightly tremulous , so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing ; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m. de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès . <EOS>	54.188922161171526
<SOS> `` you were at the festival of your marriage ? '' <EOS>	54.25646282003176
<SOS> said the deputy , shuddering in spite of himself . <EOS>	74.15142759515798
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur ; i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years . '' <EOS>	96.82136466227377
<SOS> villefort , impassive as he was , was struck with this coincidence ; and the tremulous voice of dantès , surprised in the midst of his happiness , struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married , and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another . <EOS>	99.73591003484277
<SOS> `` this philosophic reflection , '' thought he , `` will make a great sensation at m. de saint méran 's ; '' and he arranged mentally , while dantès awaited further questions , the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence . <EOS>	104.300854610776
<SOS> when this speech was arranged , villefort turned to dantès . <EOS>	72.59969919610447
<SOS> < num > m `` go on , sir , '' said he . <EOS>	83.2811903249247
<SOS> `` what would you have me say ? '' <EOS>	57.45574584885
<SOS> `` give all the information in your power . '' <EOS>	86.69010876299096
<SOS> `` tell me on which point you desire information , and i will tell all i know ; only , '' added he , with a smile , `` i warn you i know very little . '' <EOS>	83.84255534124334
<SOS> `` have you served under the usurper ? '' <EOS>	107.88144828871435
<SOS> `` i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell . '' <EOS>	56.38543055749035
<SOS> `` it is reported your political opinions are extreme , '' said villefort , who had never heard anything of the kind , but was not sorry to make this inquiry , as if it were an accusation . <EOS>	57.56049449898895
<SOS> `` my political opinions ! '' <EOS>	81.67558787120184
<SOS> replied dantès . <EOS>	57.428634504809146
<SOS> `` alas , sir , i never had any opinions . <EOS>	70.38901496055284
<SOS> i am hardly nineteen ; i know nothing ; i have no part to play . <EOS>	71.33185650214476
<SOS> if i obtain the situation i desire , i shall owe it to m. morrel . <EOS>	103.51216120224964
<SOS> thus all my opinions i will not say public , but private are confined to these three sentiments , i love my father , i respect m. morrel , and i adore mercédès . <EOS>	85.52338295379063
<SOS> this , sir , is all i can tell you , and you see how uninteresting it is . '' <EOS>	98.02866417748187
<SOS> as dantès spoke , villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance , and recollected the words of renée , who , without knowing who the culprit was , had besought his indulgence for him . <EOS>	40.506490086422325
<SOS> with the deputy 's knowledge of crime and criminals , every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence . <EOS>	59.87652141099503
<SOS> this lad , for he was scarcely a man , simple , natural , eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for ; full of affection for everybody , because he was happy , and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge , spite of villefort 's severe look and stern accent . <EOS>	74.24745342148488
<SOS> dantès seemed full of kindness . <EOS>	86.38443673762828
<SOS> `` pardieu ! '' <EOS>	64.72477306730426
<SOS> said villefort , `` he is a noble fellow . <EOS>	87.45917685384039
<SOS> i hope i shall gain renée 's favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me . <EOS>	63.55201667410728
<SOS> i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public , and a sweet kiss in private . '' <EOS>	79.91801967714352
<SOS> full of this idea , villefort 's face became so joyous , that when he turned to dantès , the latter , who had watched the change on his physiognomy , was smiling also . <EOS>	87.96415783604125
<SOS> `` sir , '' said villefort , `` have you any enemies , at least , that you know . '' <EOS>	51.00725066079336
<SOS> `` i have enemies ? '' <EOS>	79.64944873395383
<SOS> replied dantès ; `` my position is not sufficiently elevated for that . <EOS>	61.48395420300048
<SOS> as for my disposition , that is , perhaps , somewhat too hasty ; but i have striven to repress it . <EOS>	86.56309020363398
<SOS> i have had ten or twelve sailors under me , and if you question them , they will tell you that they love and respect me , not as a father , for i am too young , but as an elder brother . '' <EOS>	69.2411624764151
<SOS> `` but you may have excited jealousy . <EOS>	76.52937193983705
<SOS> you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post ; you are about to marry a pretty girl , who loves you ; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone . '' <EOS>	78.02788388181405
<SOS> `` you are right ; you know men better than i do , and what you say may possibly be the case , i confess ; but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it , because then i should be forced to hate them . '' <EOS>	77.47780187857988
<SOS> `` you are wrong ; you should always strive to see clearly around you . <EOS>	93.80317445443457
<SOS> you seem a worthy young man ; i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation . <EOS>	78.82050177043287
<SOS> here is the paper ; do you know the writing ? '' <EOS>	81.13513351426484
<SOS> as he spoke , villefort drew the letter from his pocket , and presented it to dantès . <EOS>	93.87457213269062
<SOS> dantès read it . <EOS>	72.95434227591196
<SOS> a cloud passed over his brow as he said : `` no , monsieur , i do not know the writing , and yet it is tolerably plain . <EOS>	98.02649949832016
<SOS> whoever did it writes well . <EOS>	72.81201858525519
<SOS> i am very fortunate , '' added he , looking gratefully at villefort , `` to be examined by such a man as you ; for this envious person is a real enemy . '' <EOS>	76.33259793700648
<SOS> and by the rapid glance that the young man 's eyes shot forth , villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness . <EOS>	42.407766561801516
<SOS> `` now , '' said the deputy , `` answer me frankly , not as a prisoner to a judge , but as one man to another who takes an interest in him , what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter ? '' <EOS>	63.38638829580277
<SOS> and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him . <EOS>	55.681087935314636
<SOS> `` none at all . <EOS>	93.99472001331871
<SOS> i will tell you the real facts . <EOS>	83.48485991854577
<SOS> i swear by my honor as a sailor , by my love for mercédès , by the life of my father `` `` speak , monsieur , '' said villefort . <EOS>	62.532557993895715
<SOS> then , internally , `` if renée could see me , i hope she would be satisfied , and would no longer call me a decapitator . '' <EOS>	53.41041136690246
<SOS> `` well , when we quitted naples , captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever . <EOS>	79.55705846413623
<SOS> as we had no doctor on board , and he was so anxious to arrive at elba , that he would not touch at any other port , his disorder rose to such a height , that at the end of the third day , feeling he was dying , he called me to him . <EOS>	60.020263766023
<SOS> 'my dear dantès , ' said he , 'swear to perform what i am going to tell you , for it is a matter of the deepest importance . ' <EOS>	102.97502310235306
<SOS> `` ' i swear , captain , ' replied i . <EOS>	73.73354895242541
<SOS> `` 'well , as after my death the command devolves on you as mate , assume the command , and bear up for the island of elba , disembark at porto ferrajo , ask for the grand marshal , give him this letter perhaps they will give you another letter , and charge you with a commission . <EOS>	91.49587965396508
<SOS> you will accomplish what i was to have done , and derive all the honor and profit from it . ' <EOS>	42.28433407584801
<SOS> `` ' i will do it , captain ; but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal 's presence as easily as you expect ? ' <EOS>	102.39724429692522
<SOS> `` 'here is a ring that will obtain audience of him , and remove every difficulty , ' said the captain . <EOS>	79.48054656961776
<SOS> at these words he gave me a ring . <EOS>	64.09621661831865
<SOS> it was time two hours after he was delirious ; the next day he died . '' <EOS>	68.32161370576009
<SOS> `` and what did you do then ? '' <EOS>	77.4675194391614
<SOS> `` what i ought to have done , and what everyone would have done in my place . <EOS>	67.41273475943635
<SOS> everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred ; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands . <EOS>	58.16296294539649
<SOS> i sailed for the island of elba , where i arrived the next day ; i ordered everybody to remain on board , and went on shore alone . <EOS>	69.76059661149571
<SOS> as i had expected , i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal ; but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him , and was instantly admitted . <EOS>	65.59011179149822
<SOS> he questioned me concerning captain leclere 's death ; and , as the latter had told me , gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris . <EOS>	81.4316641416715
<SOS> i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do . <EOS>	84.71778233302877
<SOS> i landed here , regulated the affairs of the vessel , and hastened to visit my affianced bride , whom i found more lovely than ever . <EOS>	73.74286304640337
<SOS> thanks to m. morrel , all the forms were got over ; in a word i was , as i told you , at my marriage feast ; and i should have been married in an hour , and tomorrow i intended to start for paris , had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust . '' <EOS>	66.83841402946058
<SOS> `` ah , '' said villefort , `` this seems to me the truth . <EOS>	81.50532151625414
<SOS> if you have been culpable , it was imprudence , and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain . <EOS>	60.024721387929404
<SOS> give up this letter you have brought from elba , and pass your word you will appear should you be required , and go and rejoin your friends . <EOS>	60.08488516459524
<SOS> `` i am free , then , sir ? '' <EOS>	76.15025189177844
<SOS> cried dantès joyfully . <EOS>	61.47382123938771
<SOS> `` yes ; but first give me this letter . '' <EOS>	50.56502240206062
<SOS> `` you have it already , for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet . '' <EOS>	59.01209716872981
<SOS> `` stop a moment , '' said the deputy , as dantès took his hat and gloves . <EOS>	106.7536466104107
<SOS> `` to whom is it addressed ? '' <EOS>	63.769522433797675
<SOS> `` to monsieur noirtier , rue coq héron , paris . '' <EOS>	71.06140826700653
<SOS> had a thunderbolt fallen into the room , villefort could not have been more stupefied . <EOS>	81.08777258594608
<SOS> he sank into his seat , and hastily turning over the packet , drew forth the fatal letter , at which he glanced with an expression of terror . <EOS>	85.06810616293191
<SOS> `` m. noirtier , rue coq héron , no . <EOS>	92.09319605005841

<SOS> `` yes , '' said dantès ; `` do you know him ? '' <EOS>	68.19038271281755

<SOS> < num > m `` it is a conspiracy , then ? '' <EOS>	45.57741001676838

<SOS> `` i have , however , already told you , sir , i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter . '' <EOS>	87.965842572749

<SOS> `` and that was too much , far too much , '' murmured villefort . <EOS>	62.199987062597124
<SOS> villefort 's brow darkened more and more , his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension . <EOS>	62.43986740021186
<SOS> after reading the letter , villefort covered his face with his hands . <EOS>	45.55376697960402
<SOS> `` oh , '' said dantès timidly , `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	96.06743589068843
<SOS> villefort made no answer , but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds , and again perused the letter . <EOS>	71.9308290556294
<SOS> `` and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter ? '' <EOS>	60.04128153564303
<SOS> `` i give you my word of honor , sir , '' said dantès ; `` but what is the matter ? <EOS>	84.07229576109683
<SOS> you are ill shall i ring for assistance ? <EOS>	56.02112250650618
<SOS> shall i call ? '' <EOS>	114.58790886590376
<SOS> `` no , '' said villefort , rising hastily ; `` stay where you are . <EOS>	66.99202172105667
<SOS> it is for me to give orders here , and not you . '' <EOS>	59.32026548588683
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' replied dantès proudly , `` it was only to summon assistance for you . '' <EOS>	101.09064143890379
<SOS> `` i want none ; it was a temporary indisposition . <EOS>	91.80767315748592
<SOS> attend to yourself ; answer me . '' <EOS>	84.59368360172513
<SOS> dantès waited , expecting a question , but in vain . <EOS>	62.214961148901565
<SOS> villefort fell back on his chair , passed his hand over his brow , moist with perspiration , and , for the third time , read the letter . <EOS>	54.223918511308476
<SOS> `` oh , if he knows the contents of this ! '' <EOS>	53.66678915169381
<SOS> murmured he , `` and that noirtier is the father of villefort , i am lost ! '' <EOS>	61.088135679771725
<SOS> and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts . <EOS>	78.97729690361956
<SOS> `` oh , it is impossible to doubt it , '' cried he , suddenly . <EOS>	71.30623298888767
<SOS> `` in heaven 's name ! '' <EOS>	77.36818966347724
<SOS> cried the unhappy young man , `` if you doubt me , question me ; i will answer you . '' <EOS>	55.119079838720594
<SOS> villefort made a violent effort , and in a tone he strove to render firm : `` sir , '' said he , `` i am no longer able , as i had hoped , to restore you immediately to liberty ; before doing so , i must consult the trial justice ; what my own feeling is you already know . '' <EOS>	84.41050284070981
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur , '' cried dantès , `` you have been rather a friend than a judge . '' <EOS>	65.87075462224944
<SOS> < num > m `` well , i must detain you some time longer , but i will strive to make it as short as possible . <EOS>	78.96180702247185
<SOS> the principal charge against you is this letter , and you see `` villefort approached the fire , cast it in , and waited until it was entirely consumed . <EOS>	98.84223451994532
<SOS> `` you see , i destroy it ? '' <EOS>	77.94125464878424
<SOS> `` oh , '' exclaimed dantès , `` you are goodness itself . '' <EOS>	92.13779856478517
<SOS> `` listen , '' continued villefort ; `` you can now have confidence in me after what i have done . '' <EOS>	70.92386754357042
<SOS> `` oh , command , and i will obey . '' <EOS>	55.595688236198164
<SOS> `` listen ; this is not a command , but advice i give you . '' <EOS>	54.562286527682815
<SOS> `` speak , and i will follow your advice . '' <EOS>	77.95720496218338
<SOS> `` i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice . <EOS>	68.44466756986375
<SOS> should anyone else interrogate you , say to him what you have said to me , but do not breathe a word of this letter . '' <EOS>	53.018168925836584
<SOS> `` i promise . '' <EOS>	57.2117614308175
<SOS> it was villefort who seemed to entreat , and the prisoner who reassured him . <EOS>	61.52422277744683
<SOS> `` you see , '' continued he , glancing toward the grate , where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames , `` the letter is destroyed ; you and i alone know of its existence ; should you , therefore , be questioned , deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly , and you are saved . '' <EOS>	80.94815444747549
<SOS> `` be satisfied ; i will deny it . '' <EOS>	96.31548894266292
<SOS> `` it was the only letter you had ? '' <EOS>	96.70413466129375
<SOS> `` it was . '' <EOS>	103.2468606579041
<SOS> `` swear it . '' <EOS>	57.677977169544114
<SOS> `` i swear it . '' <EOS>	60.97557072240781
<SOS> villefort rang . <EOS>	60.27154225991914
<SOS> a police agent entered . <EOS>	79.78908334042318
<SOS> villefort whispered some words in his ear , to which the officer replied by a motion of his head . <EOS>	87.12476931699403
<SOS> `` follow him , '' said villefort to dantès . <EOS>	86.57469283041661
<SOS> dantès saluted villefort and retired . <EOS>	70.6038919796262
<SOS> hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair . <EOS>	106.83513822335665
<SOS> `` alas , alas , '' murmured he , `` if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined . <EOS>	81.04676243884006
<SOS> this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes . <EOS>	80.64047853500291
<SOS> oh , my father , must your past career always interfere with my successes ? '' <EOS>	66.1196793619425
<SOS> suddenly a light passed over his face , a smile played round his set mouth , and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought . <EOS>	57.42772400696124
<SOS> `` this will do , '' said he , `` and from this letter , which might have ruined me , i will make my fortune . <EOS>	66.53991706161236
<SOS> now to the work i have in hand . '' <EOS>	65.80210742351203
<SOS> and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone , the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed . <EOS>	61.92633109141555
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	68.07341559168415
<SOS> the château d'if the commissary of police , as he traversed the antechamber , made a sign to two gendarmes , who placed themselves one on dantès ' right and the other on his left . <EOS>	86.19553763892226
<SOS> a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened , and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors , whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder . <EOS>	79.4032245657967
<SOS> the palais de justice communicated with the prison , a sombre edifice , that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules . <EOS>	62.12890140132033
<SOS> after numberless windings , dantès saw a door with an iron wicket . <EOS>	69.05250185527527
<SOS> the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice , every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart . <EOS>	82.93510456585668
<SOS> the door opened , the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward , and the door closed with a loud sound behind him . <EOS>	52.04758711327582
<SOS> the air he inhaled was no longer pure , but thick and mephitic , he was in prison . <EOS>	49.18233063926966
<SOS> he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber , but grated and barred , and its appearance , therefore , did not greatly alarm him ; besides , the words of villefort , who seemed to interest himself so much , resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom . <EOS>	102.16517117070795
<SOS> it was four o'clock when dantès was placed in this chamber . <EOS>	82.5493578587836
<SOS> it was , as we have said , the < num > st of march , and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness . <EOS>	103.83427145630769
<SOS> the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing ; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door , convinced they were about to liberate him , but the sound died away , and dantès sank again into his seat . <EOS>	82.56711147428103
<SOS> at last , about ten o'clock , and just as dantès began to despair , steps were heard in the corridor , a key turned in the lock , the bolts creaked , the massy oaken door flew open , and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment . <EOS>	61.71716727681367
<SOS> by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes . <EOS>	51.38169159147725
<SOS> he had advanced at first , but stopped at the sight of this display of force . <EOS>	61.20442935235924
<SOS> `` are you come to fetch me ? '' <EOS>	115.18145439975713
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	93.41912827562561
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied a gendarme . <EOS>	64.62556613761666
<SOS> `` by the orders of the deputy procureur ? '' <EOS>	56.90766400419319
<SOS> `` i believe so . '' <EOS>	82.08311752826924
<SOS> the conviction that they came from m. de villefort relieved all dantès ' apprehensions ; he advanced calmly , and placed himself in the centre of the escort . <EOS>	55.91124799903842
<SOS> a carriage waited at the door , the coachman was on the box , and a police officer sat beside him . <EOS>	65.77525322708404
<SOS> `` is this carriage for me ? '' <EOS>	108.79816200715456
<SOS> said dantès . <EOS>	63.09657437238753
<SOS> `` it is for you , '' replied a gendarme . <EOS>	72.39964699717332
<SOS> dantès was about to speak ; but feeling himself urged forward , and having neither the power nor the intention to resist , he mounted the steps , and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes ; the two others took their places opposite , and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones . <EOS>	64.81630329399161
<SOS> the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated ; he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither . <EOS>	62.174612657204214
<SOS> through the grating , however , dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie , and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis , to the quay . <EOS>	77.7207978437672
<SOS> soon he saw the lights of la consigne . <EOS>	55.27304442224041
<SOS> the carriage stopped , the officer descended , approached the guardhouse , a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order ; dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay . <EOS>	68.77652796637771
<SOS> `` can all this force be summoned on my account ? '' <EOS>	93.91347323781228
<SOS> thought he . <EOS>	105.10707346422186
<SOS> the officer opened the door , which was locked , and , without speaking a word , answered dantès ' question ; for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port . <EOS>	93.27203450959301
<SOS> the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first , then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example . <EOS>	52.55982705720484
<SOS> they advanced towards a boat , which a custom house officer held by a chain , near the quay . <EOS>	96.64705613369667
<SOS> the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity . <EOS>	74.44308902197649
<SOS> in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat , between the gendarmes , while the officer stationed himself at the bow ; a shove sent the boat adrift , and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon . <EOS>	66.93761480903675
<SOS> at a shout from the boat , the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were , as dantès knew , in the frioul and outside the inner harbor . <EOS>	88.94627344185001
<SOS> the prisoner 's first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom ; but he soon sighed , for he passed before la réserve , where he had that morning been so happy , and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball . <EOS>	74.29067021100909
<SOS> dantès folded his hands , raised his eyes to heaven , and prayed fervently . <EOS>	61.83603502458392
<SOS> < num > m the boat continued her voyage . <EOS>	56.969415519265304
<SOS> they had passed the tête de mort , were now off the anse du pharo , and about to double the battery . <EOS>	78.43037608089634
<SOS> this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès . <EOS>	70.22061246484967
<SOS> `` whither are you taking me ? '' <EOS>	87.31071642946026
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	55.30647535980558
<SOS> `` you will soon know . '' <EOS>	45.55351466373355
<SOS> `` but still `` `` we are forbidden to give you any explanation . '' <EOS>	82.56366128834921
<SOS> dantès , trained in discipline , knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates , who were forbidden to reply ; and so he remained silent . <EOS>	117.81012218157457
<SOS> the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind . <EOS>	54.28951486472808
<SOS> the boat they were in could not make a long voyage ; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor ; he thought , perhaps , they were going to leave him on some distant point . <EOS>	64.58029540565988
<SOS> he was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him ; this seemed a good augury . <EOS>	54.71141461500136
<SOS> besides , had not the deputy , who had been so kind to him , told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier , he had nothing to apprehend ? <EOS>	75.19579639033334
<SOS> had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter , the only proof against him ? <EOS>	54.32647030687967
<SOS> he waited silently , striving to pierce through the darkness . <EOS>	59.05776992663989
<SOS> they had left the ile ratonneau , where the lighthouse stood , on the right , and were now opposite the point des catalans . <EOS>	73.38291835095951
<SOS> it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach , for it was there mercédès dwelt . <EOS>	78.92877895796667
<SOS> how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her ? <EOS>	89.14498445925331
<SOS> one light alone was visible ; and dantès saw that it came from mercédès ' chamber . <EOS>	80.48376768353627
<SOS> mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement . <EOS>	88.31627603914984
<SOS> a loud cry could be heard by her . <EOS>	57.73911985944926
<SOS> but pride restrained him and he did not utter it . <EOS>	93.98735091893373
<SOS> what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman ? <EOS>	49.569542795704585
<SOS> he remained silent , his eyes fixed upon the light ; the boat went on , but the prisoner thought only of mercédès . <EOS>	50.41375715006521
<SOS> an intervening elevation of land hid the light . <EOS>	110.89426692488951
<SOS> dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea . <EOS>	116.60138705445831
<SOS> while he had been absorbed in thought , they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail ; the boat was now moving with the wind . <EOS>	64.3211316348809
<SOS> in spite of his repugnance to address the guards , dantès turned to the nearest gendarme , and taking his hand , `` comrade , '' said he , `` i adjure you , as a christian and a soldier , to tell me where we are going . <EOS>	78.41995971342033
<SOS> i am captain dantès , a loyal frenchman , thought accused of treason ; tell me where you are conducting me , and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate . '' <EOS>	45.04189861581466
<SOS> the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion , who returned for answer a sign that said , `` i see no great harm in telling him now , '' and the gendarme replied : `` you are a native of marseilles , and a sailor , and yet you do not know where you are going ? '' <EOS>	110.659359254527
<SOS> `` on my honor , i have no idea . '' <EOS>	81.53781862738722
<SOS> `` have you no idea whatever ? '' <EOS>	68.97519066579241
<SOS> `` none at all . '' <EOS>	71.4372566623175
<SOS> `` that is impossible . '' <EOS>	112.52329675934574
<SOS> `` i swear to you it is true . <EOS>	91.83221515523412
<SOS> tell me , i entreat . '' <EOS>	71.05354027930699
<SOS> `` but my orders . '' <EOS>	66.78263854413036
<SOS> `` your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes , in half an hour , or an hour . <EOS>	89.75744668922927
<SOS> you see i can not escape , even if i intended . '' <EOS>	91.93086303472624
<SOS> `` unless you are blind , or have never been outside the harbor , you must know . '' <EOS>	68.27763246039818
<SOS> `` i do not . '' <EOS>	59.59977983831007
<SOS> `` look round you then . '' <EOS>	104.58827991060666
<SOS> dantès rose and looked forward , when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the château d'if . <EOS>	80.69542340116443
<SOS> this gloomy fortress , which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends , seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor . <EOS>	105.24849495840695
<SOS> `` the château d'if ? '' <EOS>	109.3734456520125
<SOS> cried he , `` what are we going there for ? '' <EOS>	55.71446434673277
<SOS> the gendarme smiled . <EOS>	84.43222476940547
<SOS> `` i am not going there to be imprisoned , '' said dantès ; `` it is only used for political prisoners . <EOS>	67.58445443801024
<SOS> i have committed no crime . <EOS>	64.19730774008856
<SOS> are there any magistrates or judges at the château d'if ? '' <EOS>	80.01277781634782
<SOS> `` there are only , '' said the gendarme , `` a governor , a garrison , turnkeys , and good thick walls . <EOS>	79.00654041850652
<SOS> come , come , do not look so astonished , or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature . '' <EOS>	46.78661534961568
<SOS> dantès pressed the gendarme 's hand as though he would crush it . <EOS>	87.89408256725433
<SOS> `` you think , then , '' said he , `` that i am taken to the château d'if to be imprisoned there ? '' <EOS>	65.49939754102517
<SOS> `` it is probable ; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard . '' <EOS>	73.11998061595253
<SOS> `` without any inquiry , without any formality ? '' <EOS>	81.17802379395111
<SOS> `` all the formalities have been gone through ; the inquiry is already made . '' <EOS>	80.05727264452075
<SOS> `` and so , in spite of m. de villefort 's promises ? '' <EOS>	64.58498297176948
<SOS> `` i do not know what m. de villefort promised you , '' said the gendarme , `` but i know we are taking you to the château d'if . <EOS>	40.42216429783157
<SOS> but what are you doing ? <EOS>	50.484159253283096
<SOS> help , comrades , help ! '' <EOS>	41.23729331473268
<SOS> by a rapid movement , which the gendarme 's practiced eye had perceived , dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea ; but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat . <EOS>	78.86344218697202
<SOS> he fell back cursing with rage . <EOS>	85.25123422547489
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	65.24724463366448
<SOS> said the gendarme , placing his knee on his chest ; `` this is the way you keep your word as a sailor ! <EOS>	50.08333604413049
<SOS> believe soft spoken gentlemen again ! <EOS>	50.3536933518629
<SOS> hark ye , my friend , i have disobeyed my first order , but i will not disobey the second ; and if you move , i will blow your brains out . '' <EOS>	91.61584001163266
<SOS> and he levelled his carbine at dantès , who felt the muzzle against his temple . <EOS>	85.94954103829112
<SOS> for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind , and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him . <EOS>	79.28571379409011
<SOS> but he bethought him of m. de villefort 's promise ; and , besides , death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible . <EOS>	85.13589755599631
<SOS> he remained motionless , but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury . <EOS>	57.02027252346435
<SOS> at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock . <EOS>	97.5867127597557
<SOS> one of the sailors leaped on shore , a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley , and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage , and that they were mooring the boat . <EOS>	81.92633605307408
<SOS> his guards , taking him by the arms and coat collar , forced him to rise , and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress , while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind . <EOS>	91.56343367450792
<SOS> dantès made no resistance ; he was like a man in a dream ; he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment ; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps ; he was conscious that he passed through a door , and that the door closed behind him ; but all this indistinctly as through a mist . <EOS>	72.98056756782171
<SOS> he did not even see the ocean , that terrible barrier against freedom , which the prisoners look upon with utter despair . <EOS>	85.56930550343141
<SOS> they halted for a minute , during which he strove to collect his thoughts . <EOS>	47.14071714121063
<SOS> he looked around ; he was in a court surrounded by high walls ; he heard the measured tread of sentinels , and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine . <EOS>	52.832371329138624
<SOS> they waited upwards of ten minutes . <EOS>	73.0556884139229
<SOS> certain dantès could not escape , the gendarmes released him . <EOS>	79.68840088083991
<SOS> they seemed awaiting orders . <EOS>	93.45378366600909
<SOS> the orders came . <EOS>	66.35720209550642
<SOS> `` where is the prisoner ? '' <EOS>	45.23879415178215
<SOS> said a voice . <EOS>	75.31640785446329
<SOS> `` here , '' replied the gendarmes . <EOS>	83.28482610098258
<SOS> `` let him follow me ; i will take him to his cell . '' <EOS>	65.86236053062963
<SOS> `` go ! '' <EOS>	84.27411571408682
<SOS> said the gendarmes , thrusting dantès forward . <EOS>	96.71774975352709
<SOS> the prisoner followed his guide , who led him into a room almost under ground , whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears ; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly , and showed dantès the features of his conductor , an under jailer , ill clothed , and of sullen appearance . <EOS>	76.36078216093401
<SOS> < num > m `` here is your chamber for tonight , '' said he . <EOS>	90.49796549790007
<SOS> `` it is late , and the governor is asleep . <EOS>	83.0229203057938
<SOS> tomorrow , perhaps , he may change you . <EOS>	44.72663525183809
<SOS> in the meantime there is bread , water , and fresh straw ; and that is all a prisoner can wish for . <EOS>	91.29498596560852
<SOS> goodnight . '' <EOS>	84.98527852348519
<SOS> and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was , the jailer disappeared , taking with him the lamp and closing the door , leaving stamped upon the prisoner 's mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon . <EOS>	59.51673169386813
<SOS> dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead . <EOS>	71.62713536775458
<SOS> with the first dawn of day the jailer returned , with orders to leave dantès where he was . <EOS>	59.51512206419733
<SOS> he found the prisoner in the same position , as if fixed there , his eyes swollen with weeping . <EOS>	68.34973883003599
<SOS> he had passed the night standing , and without sleep . <EOS>	60.33486910068764
<SOS> the jailer advanced ; dantès appeared not to perceive him . <EOS>	81.34861802654235
<SOS> he touched him on the shoulder . <EOS>	69.06761300853151
<SOS> edmond started . <EOS>	54.812519364557154
<SOS> `` have you not slept ? '' <EOS>	111.09764654035729
<SOS> said the jailer . <EOS>	58.775495302632436
<SOS> `` i do not know , '' replied dantès . <EOS>	114.79318181203925
<SOS> the jailer stared . <EOS>	78.51359210335872
<SOS> `` are you hungry ? '' <EOS>	49.380187222911346
<SOS> continued he . <EOS>	65.50696437436332
<SOS> `` i do not know . '' <EOS>	99.51546207154026
<SOS> `` do you wish for anything ? '' <EOS>	89.48093912644285
<SOS> `` i wish to see the governor . '' <EOS>	111.01852318046599
<SOS> the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber . <EOS>	67.09108920667032
<SOS> dantès followed him with his eyes , and stretched forth his hands towards the open door ; but the door closed . <EOS>	50.548665991117026
<SOS> all his emotion then burst forth ; he cast himself on the ground , weeping bitterly , and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished . <EOS>	86.73419911567305
<SOS> the day passed thus ; he scarcely tasted food , but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage . <EOS>	64.00340215416895
<SOS> one thought in particular tormented him : namely , that during his journey hither he had sat so still , whereas he might , a dozen times , have plunged into the sea , and , thanks to his powers of swimming , for which he was famous , have gained the shore , concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel , escaped to spain or italy , where mercédès and his father could have joined him . <EOS>	56.43569194220701
<SOS> he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere . <EOS>	105.59197910585436
<SOS> he spoke italian like a tuscan , and spanish like a castilian ; he would have been free , and happy with mercédès and his father , whereas he was now confined in the château d'if , that impregnable fortress , ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès ; and all this because he had trusted to villefort 's promise . <EOS>	86.06691944961005
<SOS> the thought was maddening , and dantès threw himself furiously down on his straw . <EOS>	107.0157532423429
<SOS> the next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again . <EOS>	110.51706861511558
<SOS> `` well , '' said the jailer , `` are you more reasonable today ? '' <EOS>	100.17895314381856
<SOS> dantès made no reply . <EOS>	80.83790522666911
<SOS> `` come , cheer up ; is there anything that i can do for you ? '' <EOS>	52.05880072306379
<SOS> `` i wish to see the governor . '' <EOS>	81.666756183585
<SOS> `` i have already told you it was impossible . '' <EOS>	114.66650900773386
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	65.05538004506306
<SOS> `` because it is against prison rules , and prisoners must not even ask for it . '' <EOS>	121.85237927851865
<SOS> `` what is allowed , then ? '' <EOS>	114.29381914276563
<SOS> `` better fare , if you pay for it , books , and leave to walk about . '' <EOS>	50.921100592667536
<SOS> `` i do not want books , i am satisfied with my food , and do not care to walk about ; but i wish to see the governor . '' <EOS>	89.54526212980018
<SOS> `` if you worry me by repeating the same thing , i will not bring you any more to eat . '' <EOS>	67.14181330584508
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said edmond , `` if you do not , i shall die of hunger that is all . '' <EOS>	85.4661099945474
<SOS> the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die ; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer , he replied in a more subdued tone . <EOS>	109.17065053239187
<SOS> `` what you ask is impossible ; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about , and some day you will meet the governor , and if he chooses to reply , that is his affair . '' <EOS>	63.01058951390931
<SOS> `` but , '' asked dantès , `` how long shall i have to wait ? '' <EOS>	81.74999793378846
<SOS> `` ah , a month six months a year . '' <EOS>	62.392581917185055
<SOS> `` it is too long a time . <EOS>	104.20550343560383
<SOS> i wish to see him at once . '' <EOS>	105.74088171963223
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the jailer , `` do not always brood over what is impossible , or you will be mad in a fortnight . '' <EOS>	101.17287379680835
<SOS> `` you think so ? '' <EOS>	103.37453523802061
<SOS> `` yes ; we have an instance here ; it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad , who was in this chamber before you . '' <EOS>	81.99491117416682
<SOS> < num > m `` how long has he left it ? '' <EOS>	58.18386303402567
<SOS> `` two years . '' <EOS>	43.99839472816629
<SOS> `` was he liberated , then ? '' <EOS>	88.0860084651863
<SOS> `` no ; he was put in a dungeon . '' <EOS>	114.50617419201116
<SOS> `` listen ! '' <EOS>	93.57299919999033
<SOS> said dantès . <EOS>	102.3221811986155
<SOS> `` i am not an abbé , i am not mad ; perhaps i shall be , but at present , unfortunately , i am not . <EOS>	109.33763221369527
<SOS> i will make you another offer . '' <EOS>	83.67245910748984
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	44.035917877886305
<SOS> `` i do not offer you a million , because i have it not ; but i will give you a hundred crowns if , the first time you go to marseilles , you will seek out a young girl named mercédès , at the catalans , and give her two lines from me . '' <EOS>	71.69838436713471
<SOS> < num > m `` if i took them , and were detected , i should lose my place , which is worth two thousand francs a year ; so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred . '' <EOS>	53.074678166589244
<SOS> `` well , '' said dantès , `` mark this ; if you refuse at least to tell mercédès i am here , i will some day hide myself behind the door , and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool . '' <EOS>	49.76870329734586
<SOS> `` threats ! '' <EOS>	76.46610464719467
<SOS> cried the jailer , retreating and putting himself on the defensive ; `` you are certainly going mad . <EOS>	46.50160479058578
<SOS> the abbé began like you , and in three days you will be like him , mad enough to tie up ; but , fortunately , there are dungeons here . '' <EOS>	72.94617313237742
<SOS> dantès whirled the stool round his head . <EOS>	97.63613186381808
<SOS> `` all right , all right , '' said the jailer ; `` all right , since you will have it so . <EOS>	60.29686065218193
<SOS> i will send word to the governor . '' <EOS>	92.5846979820352
<SOS> `` very well , '' returned dantès , dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad . <EOS>	59.589062958471374
<SOS> the jailer went out , and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers . <EOS>	82.42732215794054
<SOS> `` by the governor 's orders , '' said he , `` conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath . '' <EOS>	81.98895544778692
<SOS> `` to the dungeon , then , '' said the corporal . <EOS>	114.29998310992838
<SOS> `` yes ; we must put the madman with the madmen . '' <EOS>	55.3041231010104
<SOS> the soldiers seized dantès , who followed passively . <EOS>	86.28940137340554
<SOS> he descended fifteen steps , and the door of a dungeon was opened , and he was thrust in . <EOS>	77.94405762923098
<SOS> the door closed , and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall ; he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness . <EOS>	81.29984119260337
<SOS> the jailer was right ; dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad . <EOS>	100.43861613285709
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	73.38752875827993
<SOS> the evening of the betrothal villefort had , as we have said , hastened back to madame de saint méran 's in the place du grand cours , and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon . <EOS>	78.28223841269147
<SOS> renée was , with all the rest of the company , anxiously awaiting him , and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation . <EOS>	67.8434154088077
<SOS> `` well , decapitator , guardian of the state , royalist , brutus , what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	106.25407281025424
<SOS> said one . <EOS>	82.74157684611805
<SOS> `` speak out . '' <EOS>	79.67405894295867
<SOS> `` are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror ? '' <EOS>	94.13380657336565
<SOS> asked another . <EOS>	50.9810177627784
<SOS> `` has the corsican ogre broken loose ? '' <EOS>	75.62793850255424
<SOS> cried a third . <EOS>	56.4421855610249
<SOS> `` marquise , '' said villefort , approaching his future mother in law , `` i request your pardon for thus leaving you . <EOS>	63.259086967796364
<SOS> will the marquis honor me by a few moments ' private conversation ? '' <EOS>	87.46682128376338
<SOS> `` ah , it is really a serious matter , then ? '' <EOS>	93.2569973754584
<SOS> asked the marquis , remarking the cloud on villefort 's brow . <EOS>	65.34013237512907
<SOS> `` so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days ; so , '' added he , turning to renée , `` judge for yourself if it be not important . '' <EOS>	60.04833800831904
<SOS> `` you are going to leave us ? '' <EOS>	64.30670183539237
<SOS> cried renée , unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement . <EOS>	54.294199811204074
<SOS> `` alas , '' returned villefort , `` i must ! '' <EOS>	65.93695865594151
<SOS> `` where , then , are you going ? '' <EOS>	54.68598934198527
<SOS> asked the marquise . <EOS>	80.06842221425597
<SOS> `` that , madame , is an official secret ; but if you have any commissions for paris , a friend of mine is going there tonight , and will with pleasure undertake them . '' <EOS>	41.104583928603176
<SOS> the guests looked at each other . <EOS>	87.21300918621833
<SOS> `` you wish to speak to me alone ? '' <EOS>	79.31213743343255
<SOS> said the marquis . <EOS>	70.62513228555059
<SOS> `` yes , let us go to the library , please . '' <EOS>	56.88631951692544
<SOS> the marquis took his arm , and they left the salon . <EOS>	62.52932626008424
<SOS> `` well , '' asked he , as soon as they were by themselves , `` tell me what it is ? '' <EOS>	96.33220561169361
<SOS> `` an affair of the greatest importance , that demands my immediate presence in paris . <EOS>	56.2366317878418
<SOS> now , excuse the indiscretion , marquis , but have you any landed property ? '' <EOS>	90.66972702674174
<SOS> `` all my fortune is in the funds ; seven or eight hundred thousand francs . '' <EOS>	42.71491868035885
<SOS> `` then sell out sell out , marquis , or you will lose it all . '' <EOS>	80.79902327792797
<SOS> < num > m `` but how can i sell out here ? '' <EOS>	104.62888540318545
<SOS> `` you have a broker , have you not ? '' <EOS>	60.9569934499528
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	69.547209275645
<SOS> `` then give me a letter to him , and tell him to sell out without an instant 's delay , perhaps even now i shall arrive too late . '' <EOS>	85.5006806223956
<SOS> `` the deuce you say ! '' <EOS>	76.12372711106212
<SOS> replied the marquis , `` let us lose no time , then ! '' <EOS>	92.74459546768212
<SOS> and , sitting down , he wrote a letter to his broker , ordering him to sell out at the market price . <EOS>	56.90117079961795
<SOS> `` now , then , '' said villefort , placing the letter in his pocketbook , `` i must have another ! '' <EOS>	68.72603075782337
<SOS> `` to whom ? '' <EOS>	60.9156777167327
<SOS> `` to the king . '' <EOS>	68.48638962437464
<SOS> `` to the king ? '' <EOS>	102.05211923238635
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	67.89407984226361
<SOS> `` i dare not write to his majesty . '' <EOS>	68.41474214815128
<SOS> `` i do not ask you to write to his majesty , but ask m. de salvieux to do so . <EOS>	49.11582243127739
<SOS> i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king 's presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience ; that would occasion a loss of precious time . '' <EOS>	64.59647589230495
<SOS> `` but address yourself to the keeper of the seals ; he has the right of entry at the tuileries , and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night . '' <EOS>	70.17563135888567
<SOS> `` doubtless ; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him . <EOS>	82.05599190858274
<SOS> the keeper would leave me in the background , and take all the glory to himself . <EOS>	59.42544493704936
<SOS> i tell you , marquis , my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first , for the king will not forget the service i do him . '' <EOS>	81.78194245552623
<SOS> `` in that case go and get ready . <EOS>	76.49978983269574
<SOS> i will call salvieux and make him write the letter . '' <EOS>	52.811264571080414
<SOS> `` be as quick as possible , i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour . '' <EOS>	78.54581220662055
<SOS> `` tell your coachman to stop at the door . '' <EOS>	71.96762119352559
<SOS> `` you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée , whom i leave on such a day with great regret . '' <EOS>	79.33878510621412
<SOS> `` you will find them both here , and can make your farewells in person . '' <EOS>	87.14320921621675
<SOS> `` a thousand thanks and now for the letter . '' <EOS>	72.23748218110761
<SOS> the marquis rang , a servant entered . <EOS>	77.57514097667047
<SOS> `` say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him . '' <EOS>	91.32435445735624
<SOS> `` now , then , go , '' said the marquis . <EOS>	69.64264723318573
<SOS> `` i shall be gone only a few moments . '' <EOS>	84.72762203971743
<SOS> villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace . <EOS>	48.89762601575591
<SOS> at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him . <EOS>	88.6298348840752
<SOS> it was mercédès , who , hearing no news of her lover , had come unobserved to inquire after him . <EOS>	93.26206886997825
<SOS> as villefort drew near , she advanced and stood before him . <EOS>	69.33055579262987
<SOS> dantès had spoken of mercédès , and villefort instantly recognized her . <EOS>	94.56630932352019
<SOS> her beauty and high bearing surprised him , and when she inquired what had become of her lover , it seemed to him that she was the judge , and he the accused . <EOS>	69.894740349731
<SOS> `` the young man you speak of , '' said villefort abruptly , `` is a great criminal , and i can do nothing for him , mademoiselle . '' <EOS>	62.57345407185782
<SOS> mercédès burst into tears , and , as villefort strove to pass her , again addressed him . <EOS>	72.40938194139379
<SOS> `` but , at least , tell me where he is , that i may know whether he is alive or dead , '' said she . <EOS>	51.581464885296676
<SOS> < num > m `` i do not know ; he is no longer in my hands , '' replied villefort . <EOS>	67.05382807623619
<SOS> and desirous of putting an end to the interview , he pushed by her , and closed the door , as if to exclude the pain he felt . <EOS>	99.42849296946962
<SOS> but remorse is not thus banished ; like virgil 's wounded hero , he carried the arrow in his wound , and , arrived at the salon , villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob , and sank into a chair . <EOS>	57.98348264100673
<SOS> then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart . <EOS>	79.38268241030066
<SOS> the man he sacrificed to his ambition , that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father 's faults , appeared to him pale and threatening , leading his affianced bride by the hand , and bringing with him remorse , not such as the ancients figured , furious and terrible , but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death . <EOS>	76.69649392694934
<SOS> then he had a moment 's hesitation . <EOS>	60.02724540942715
<SOS> he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals , and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned , and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort 's brow , because they were guilty ; at least , he believed so ; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed . <EOS>	81.63983108811654
<SOS> in this case he was not the judge , but the executioner . <EOS>	76.18740496421698
<SOS> as he thus reflected , he felt the sensation we have described , and which had hitherto been unknown to him , arise in his bosom , and fill him with vague apprehensions . <EOS>	93.82569641496899
<SOS> it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed , but villefort 's was one of those that never close , or if they do , only close to reopen more agonizing than ever . <EOS>	118.08847695459643
<SOS> if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy , or the fair mercédès had entered and said , `` in the name of god , i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband , '' his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release ; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber , and the door was opened only by villefort 's valet , who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness . <EOS>	67.2597536370481
<SOS> villefort rose , or rather sprang , from his chair , hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk , emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket , stood motionless an instant , his hand pressed to his head , muttered a few inarticulate sounds , and then , perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders , he sprang into the carriage , ordering the postilions to drive to m. de saint méran 's . <EOS>	74.53224102061084
<SOS> the hapless dantès was doomed . <EOS>	68.4448088271714
<SOS> as the marquis had promised , villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting . <EOS>	109.4740580153439
<SOS> he started when he saw renée , for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès . <EOS>	57.502709372892525
<SOS> alas , her emotions were wholly personal : she was thinking only of villefort 's departure . <EOS>	72.6988556325796
<SOS> she loved villefort , and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband . <EOS>	83.27460203968415
<SOS> villefort knew not when he should return , and renée , far from pleading for dantès , hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover . <EOS>	109.33342695009976
<SOS> < num > m meanwhile what of mercédès ? <EOS>	79.49047369152912
<SOS> she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge ; she had returned to the catalans , and had despairingly cast herself on her couch . <EOS>	95.88135587492596

<SOS> m. morrel had not readily given up the fight . <EOS>	70.82092270878655
<SOS> he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison , and he had gone to all his friends , and the influential persons of the city ; but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent ; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible , he met with nothing but refusal , and had returned home in despair , declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done . <EOS>	76.84994653442851
<SOS> caderousse was equally restless and uneasy , but instead of seeking , like m. morrel , to aid dantès , he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy , in the hope of drowning reflection . <EOS>	58.11703333351629
<SOS> but he did not succeed , and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink , and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened . <EOS>	67.9564220037449

<SOS> there , seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell , and to which , from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people , he was particularly attached , the king , louis xviii. , was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age , with gray hair , aristocratic bearing , and exceedingly gentlemanly attire , and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius 's rather inaccurate , but much sought after , edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch . <EOS>	81.12053488668195

<SOS> `` sire , '' continued m. de blacas , `` if it only be to reassure a faithful servant , will your majesty send into languedoc , provence , and dauphiné , trusty men , who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces ? '' <EOS>	106.40715530714108
<SOS> `` canimus surdis , '' replied the king , continuing the annotations in his horace . <EOS>	71.56017950681691

<SOS> there was a brief pause , during which louis xviii . <EOS>	53.26082953144656
<SOS> wrote , in a hand as small as possible , another note on the margin of his horace , and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own , while he is only commenting upon the idea of another , said : `` go on , my dear duke , go on i listen . '' <EOS>	46.273312509292666
<SOS> `` sire , '' said blacas , who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit , `` i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me ; but a serious minded man , deserving all my confidence , and charged by me to watch over the south '' ( the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words ) , `` has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king , and so i hastened to you , sire .

<SOS> `` yes , indeed , my dear duke . <EOS>	83.54640558415466

<SOS> `` and , moreover , my dear duke , '' continued the minister of police , `` we are almost assured that , in a very short time , the usurper will be insane . '' <EOS>	65.51125795415606

<SOS> m. de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister . <EOS>	67.90334897338977
<SOS> villefort , who did not choose to reveal the whole secret , lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure , had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness . <EOS>	87.23456542878861
<SOS> `` well , well , dandré , '' said louis xviii. , `` blacas is not yet convinced ; let us proceed , therefore , to the usurper 's conversion . '' <EOS>	64.51563671517515

<SOS> `` i say , sire , that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am ; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty , it is probable that i am in error . <EOS>	51.22718269660901

<SOS> `` oh , sire , '' replied the minister , `` we have no occasion to invent any ; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations , coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render , but can not ; they trust to fortune , and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions .

<SOS> the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man ; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again . <EOS>	52.83188297044204
<SOS> louis xviii . <EOS>	50.597821224984216

<SOS> m. de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed , but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king 's authority . <EOS>	53.569075315133986
<SOS> villefort 's dusty garb , his costume , which was not of courtly cut , excited the susceptibility of m. de brezé , who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire . <EOS>	43.395715876659324
<SOS> the duke , however , overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty 's order ; and , in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles , villefort was introduced . <EOS>	74.81589883232738
<SOS> the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him . <EOS>	75.07007431217853

<SOS> `` speak , sir , and pray begin at the beginning ; i like order in everything . '' <EOS>	116.50728018694227

<SOS> a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium , assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor , and he went on : `` sire , i have come as rapidly to paris as possible , to inform your majesty that i have discovered , in the exercise of my duties , not a commonplace and insignificant plot , such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army , but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty 's throne . <EOS>	42.60324488015408

<SOS> `` sire , i fear it is more than a plot ; i fear it is a conspiracy . '' <EOS>	94.6321291719994
<SOS> `` a conspiracy in these times , '' said louis xviii. , smiling , `` is a thing very easy to meditate , but more difficult to conduct to an end , inasmuch as , re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future . <EOS>	83.32028055838786

<SOS> at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door , pale , trembling , and as if ready to faint . <EOS>	54.34388360226779

<SOS> the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii . <EOS>	97.82707879245238

<SOS> m. de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron , but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman ; and besides , as matters were , it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect . <EOS>	104.94897258360146

<SOS> `` alas , sire , it is but too true ! '' <EOS>	87.21804301233831

<SOS> `` what , you do not know ! <EOS>	108.3889465328598
<SOS> have you neglected to obtain information on that point ? <EOS>	89.92649497343444
<SOS> of course it is of no consequence , '' he added , with a withering smile . <EOS>	79.0296234311677
<SOS> `` sire , it was impossible to learn ; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper . '' <EOS>	74.16514682542395

<SOS> inquired the king . <EOS>	71.04853591426756
<SOS> the minister bowed his head , and while a deep color overspread his cheeks , he stammered out : `` by the telegraph , sire . '' <EOS>	59.79396216462807
<SOS> louis xviii . <EOS>	49.3984450707515

<SOS> i have , during those five and twenty years , spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me ; and now , when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach , the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms ! '' <EOS>	74.74595853385105
<SOS> `` sire , it is fatality ! '' <EOS>	61.978963516981075
<SOS> murmured the minister , feeling that the pressure of circumstances , however light a thing to destiny , was too much for any human strength to endure . <EOS>	75.29690561323252
<SOS> `` what our enemies say of us is then true . <EOS>	70.66533361617006

<SOS> if i were betrayed as he was , i would console myself ; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor , who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves , for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing , and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude ! <EOS>	65.61441503063747
<SOS> oh , yes , sir , you are right it is fatality ! '' <EOS>	49.13985562676811
<SOS> the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm . <EOS>	68.52258356613896
<SOS> m. de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow . <EOS>	74.4908223410785
<SOS> villefort smiled within himself , for he felt his increased importance . <EOS>	58.544722447324
<SOS> `` to fall , '' continued king louis , who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended , `` to fall , and learn of that fall by telegraph ! <EOS>	109.30334134636055
<SOS> oh , i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother , louis xvi. , than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule . <EOS>	68.64333639341507
<SOS> ridicule , sir why , you know not its power in france , and yet you ought to know it ! '' <EOS>	76.09603755578021
<SOS> `` sire , sire , '' murmured the minister , `` for pity 's `` `` approach , m. de villefort , '' resumed the king , addressing the young man , who , motionless and breathless , was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom . <EOS>	72.56038627468932
<SOS> `` approach , and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known . '' <EOS>	75.25612929248146
<SOS> `` sire , it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world . '' <EOS>	91.92999468727157
<SOS> `` really impossible ! <EOS>	56.56458402503207
<SOS> yes that is a great word , sir . <EOS>	49.913124731508226
<SOS> unfortunately , there are great words , as there are great men ; i have measured them . <EOS>	98.65863077570123
<SOS> really impossible for a minister who has an office , agents , spies , and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money , to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france ! <EOS>	95.02598967239403
<SOS> well , then , see , here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman , only a simple magistrate , who learned more than you with all your police , and who would have saved my crown , if , like you , he had the power of directing a telegraph . '' <EOS>	57.30762747055539
<SOS> the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort , who bent his head in modest triumph . <EOS>	48.23741518610817
<SOS> `` i do not mean that for you , blacas , '' continued louis xviii . <EOS>	57.02585015987315
<SOS> ; `` for if you have discovered nothing , at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions . <EOS>	96.52141736102787
<SOS> any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m. de villefort insignificant , or else dictated by venal ambition . '' <EOS>	65.47098358757765
<SOS> these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before . <EOS>	93.47685526828938
<SOS> villefort understood the king 's intent . <EOS>	73.64137582423851
<SOS> any other person would , perhaps , have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise ; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister , although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost . <EOS>	62.58840127275225
<SOS> in fact , the minister , who , in the plenitude of his power , had been unable to unearth napoleon 's secret , might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort 's plot . <EOS>	98.14601524295085
<SOS> realizing this , villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister , instead of aiding to crush him . <EOS>	61.90884063127469
<SOS> `` sire , '' said villefort , `` the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence ; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance , and i have profited by that chance , like a good and devoted servant that 's all . <EOS>	55.63470187226283
<SOS> do not attribute to me more than i deserve , sire , that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me . '' <EOS>	109.33703417429311
<SOS> the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look , and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design ; that is to say , that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king , he had made a friend of one on whom , in case of necessity , he might rely . <EOS>	67.62180362909054
<SOS> `` 't is well , '' resumed the king . <EOS>	84.32582498746102
<SOS> `` and now , gentlemen , '' he continued , turning towards m. de blacas and the minister of police , `` i have no further occasion for you , and you may retire ; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war . '' <EOS>	118.22089815084033
<SOS> `` fortunately , sire , '' said m. de blacas , `` we can rely on the army ; your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment . '' <EOS>	103.11662135168939
<SOS> `` do not mention reports , duke , to me , for i know now what confidence to place in them . <EOS>	66.5542497984993
<SOS> yet , speaking of reports , baron , what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques ? '' <EOS>	64.87471092102113
<SOS> `` the affair in the rue saint jacques ! '' <EOS>	52.42381616754914
<SOS> exclaimed villefort , unable to repress an exclamation . <EOS>	57.580935771853056
<SOS> then , suddenly pausing , he added , `` your pardon , sire , but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget , not the respect i have , for that is too deeply engraved in my heart , but the rules of etiquette . '' <EOS>	82.83927773376476
<SOS> `` go on , go on , sir , '' replied the king ; `` you have today earned the right to make inquiries here . '' <EOS>	100.94197869078698
<SOS> `` sire , '' interposed the minister of police , `` i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head , when your majesty 's attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf , and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty . '' <EOS>	88.14677993495025
<SOS> `` on the contrary , sir , on the contrary , '' said louis xviii. , `` this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention , and the death of general quesnel will , perhaps , put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy . '' <EOS>	99.00022745470325
<SOS> at the name of general quesnel , villefort trembled . <EOS>	63.876326360412364
<SOS> `` everything points to the conclusion , sire , '' said the minister of police , `` that death was not the result of suicide , as we first believed , but of assassination . <EOS>	78.42490104410132
<SOS> general quesnel , it appears , had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared . <EOS>	82.2859170061734
<SOS> an unknown person had been with him that morning , and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques ; unfortunately , the general 's valet , who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered , heard the street mentioned , but did not catch the number . '' <EOS>	110.0662018278244
<SOS> as the police minister related this to the king , villefort , who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker 's lips , turned alternately red and pale . <EOS>	49.15404088024742
<SOS> the king looked towards him . <EOS>	42.21075690716449
<SOS> `` do you not think with me , m. de villefort , that general quesnel , whom they believed attached to the usurper , but who was really entirely devoted to me , has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush ? '' <EOS>	55.746313788301244
<SOS> `` it is probable , sire , '' replied villefort . <EOS>	114.99161780667303
<SOS> `` but is this all that is known ? '' <EOS>	52.63936356496205
<SOS> `` they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him . '' <EOS>	67.06126963675987
<SOS> `` on his track ? '' <EOS>	102.88707427444227
<SOS> said villefort . <EOS>	111.73404021581912
<SOS> `` yes , the servant has given his description . <EOS>	58.39168911390337
<SOS> he is a man of from fifty to fifty two years of age , dark , with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows , and a thick moustache . <EOS>	115.24889137495911
<SOS> he was dressed in a blue frock coat , buttoned up to the chin , and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor . <EOS>	90.02573153989792
<SOS> yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed , but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq héron . '' <EOS>	97.21853520221946
<SOS> villefort leaned on the back of an armchair , for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him ; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him , he breathed again . <EOS>	75.38657739923218
<SOS> `` continue to seek for this man , sir , '' said the king to the minister of police ; `` for if , as i am all but convinced , general quesnel , who would have been so useful to us at this moment , has been murdered , his assassins , bonapartists or not , shall be cruelly punished . '' <EOS>	79.70902341500434
<SOS> it required all villefort 's coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him . <EOS>	106.72055557499988
<SOS> `` how strange , '' continued the king , with some asperity ; `` the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say , ' a murder has been committed , ' and especially so when they can add , 'and we are on the track of the guilty persons . ' '' <EOS>	82.62206365806377
<SOS> `` sire , your majesty will , i trust , be amply satisfied on this point at least . '' <EOS>	70.87413702907064
<SOS> `` we shall see . <EOS>	60.25414848624775
<SOS> i will no longer detain you , m. de villefort , for you must be fatigued after so long a journey ; go and rest . <EOS>	82.92636569022109
<SOS> of course you stopped at your father 's ? '' <EOS>	78.89898687585104
<SOS> a feeling of faintness came over villefort . <EOS>	94.62442798507786
<SOS> < num > m `` no , sire , '' he replied , `` i alighted at the hotel de madrid , in the rue de tournon . '' <EOS>	52.932417385990114
<SOS> `` but you have seen him ? '' <EOS>	88.60355443911546

<SOS> `` i think not , sire . '' <EOS>	106.35400437610406
<SOS> `` ah , i forgot , '' said louis , smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive ; `` i forgot you and m. noirtier are not on the best terms possible , and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause , and for which you should be recompensed .

<SOS> `` sire , the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for . '' <EOS>	106.81991693914563
<SOS> `` never mind , sir , we will not forget you ; make your mind easy . <EOS>	68.98053611823191
<SOS> in the meanwhile '' ( the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat , near the cross of st. louis , above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st. lazare , and gave it to villefort ) `` in the meanwhile take this cross . '' <EOS>	45.41786384450785

<SOS> m. noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door , then that of the bedchamber , and then extended his hand to villefort , who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal . <EOS>	106.30334389111422

<SOS> then all looked at each other , he was made to take an oath , and did so , but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus , and yet , in spite of that , the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free . <EOS>	71.41750989903676

<SOS> noirtier left the room when he had finished , with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation . <EOS>	54.00601937401333
<SOS> villefort , pale and agitated , ran to the window , put aside the curtain , and saw him pass , cool and collected , by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street , who were there , perhaps , to arrest a man with black whiskers , and a blue frock coat , and hat with broad brim . <EOS>	90.82400220797108
<SOS> villefort stood watching , breathless , until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy . <EOS>	47.95700228161543
<SOS> then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him , put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau , threw the hat into a dark closet , broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire , put on his travelling cap , and calling his valet , checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask , paid his bill , sprang into his carriage , which was ready , learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble , and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road , at length reached marseilles , a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes . <EOS>	91.54020684009544

<SOS> the hundred days m. noirtier was a true prophet , and things progressed rapidly , as he had predicted . <EOS>	81.29841034115275
<SOS> everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba , a return which was unprecedented in the past , and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future . <EOS>	116.3996253142101
<SOS> louis xviii . <EOS>	64.41492312699731
<SOS> made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow ; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation , and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground . <EOS>	106.59937385283774
<SOS> villefort , therefore , gained nothing save the king 's gratitude ( which was rather likely to injure him at the present time ) and the cross of the legion of honor , which he had the prudence not to wear , although m. de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet . <EOS>	79.45992238744866
<SOS> napoleon would , doubtless , have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier , who was all powerful at court , and thus the girondin of ' < num > and the senator of < num > protected him who so lately had been his protector . <EOS>	89.91126843308108
<SOS> all villefort 's influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged . <EOS>	70.18243588739767
<SOS> the king 's procureur alone was deprived of his office , being suspected of royalism . <EOS>	59.46617733200934
<SOS> however , scarcely was the imperial power established that is , scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers , he found on the table there louis xviii . <EOS>	99.15997843340772
<SOS> 's half filled snuff box , scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began , in spite of the authorities , to rekindle the flames of civil war , always smouldering in the south , and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad . <EOS>	95.92261051695237
<SOS> < num > m owing to this change , the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful , because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man , so much so , that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of `` moderation '' but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès . <EOS>	86.27277065636086
<SOS> villefort retained his place , but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity . <EOS>	70.65170257708489
<SOS> if the emperor remained on the throne , gérard required a different alliance to aid his career ; if louis xviii . <EOS>	112.1282648625783
<SOS> returned , the influence of m. de saint méran , like his own , could be vastly increased , and the marriage be still more suitable . <EOS>	63.53576820941323
<SOS> the deputy procureur was , therefore , the first magistrate of marseilles , when one morning his door opened , and m. morrel was announced . <EOS>	61.97439914012548
<SOS> anyone else would have hastened to receive him ; but villefort was a man of ability , and he knew this would be a sign of weakness . <EOS>	61.46980346257002
<SOS> he made morrel wait in the antechamber , although he had no one with him , for the simple reason that the king 's procureur always makes everyone wait , and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers , he ordered m. morrel to be admitted . <EOS>	84.812511763531
<SOS> morrel expected villefort would be dejected ; he found him as he had found him six weeks before , calm , firm , and full of that glacial politeness , that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man . <EOS>	73.29152499857835
<SOS> he had entered villefort 's office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him ; on the contrary , he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk , and his head leaning on his hand . <EOS>	58.138461932979624
<SOS> he stopped at the door ; villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him ; then , after a brief interval , during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands , `` m. morrel , i believe ? '' <EOS>	98.97351491664672
<SOS> said villefort . <EOS>	84.51217502049482
<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	98.37842709405348
<SOS> `` come nearer , '' said the magistrate , with a patronizing wave of the hand , `` and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit . '' <EOS>	95.08202720089734
<SOS> `` do you not guess , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	77.67862776043839
<SOS> asked morrel . <EOS>	72.02767159527879
<SOS> `` not in the least ; but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted . '' <EOS>	78.31313701152285
<SOS> `` everything depends on you . '' <EOS>	54.76544494740215
<SOS> `` explain yourself , pray . '' <EOS>	93.36117614544034
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said morrel , recovering his assurance as he proceeded , `` do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor , i came to intercede for a young man , the mate of my ship , who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba ? <EOS>	51.49528717954745
<SOS> what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor . <EOS>	56.3447532312737

<SOS> `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	92.75212195873245
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	80.6941734540175
<SOS> `` tell me his name . '' <EOS>	107.37000799095972
<SOS> `` edmond dantès . '' <EOS>	55.68722322007137
<SOS> villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken ; but he did not blanch . <EOS>	86.16507300572307
<SOS> `` dantès , '' repeated he , `` edmond dantès . '' <EOS>	45.04130309512167
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur . '' <EOS>	71.56677513391018
<SOS> villefort opened a large register , then went to a table , from the table turned to his registers , and then , turning to morrel , `` are you quite sure you are not mistaken , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	93.37727721246178
<SOS> said he , in the most natural tone in the world . <EOS>	83.14349256312218
<SOS> had morrel been a more quick sighted man , or better versed in these matters , he would have been surprised at the king 's procureur answering him on such a subject , instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department . <EOS>	99.9318329217845
<SOS> but morrel , disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear , was conscious only of the other 's condescension . <EOS>	79.41828822696473
<SOS> villefort had calculated rightly . <EOS>	61.18070827692098
<SOS> `` no , '' said morrel ; `` i am not mistaken . <EOS>	88.66302751533433

<SOS> oh , the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days . '' <EOS>	81.84841015770758
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' returned villefort , `` i was then a royalist , because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne , but the chosen of the nation . <EOS>	106.34615953313258
<SOS> the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me , the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people . '' <EOS>	96.82633913917842
<SOS> `` that 's right ! '' <EOS>	63.78727614024733
<SOS> cried morrel . <EOS>	109.78388018500084
<SOS> `` i like to hear you speak thus , and i augur well for edmond from it . '' <EOS>	82.62664710379494
<SOS> `` wait a moment , '' said villefort , turning over the leaves of a register ; `` i have it a sailor , who was about to marry a young catalan girl . <EOS>	117.04548093754684
<SOS> i recollect now ; it was a very serious charge . '' <EOS>	71.87140832651117
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	70.3333707518502
<SOS> `` you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice . '' <EOS>	76.609330407748
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	94.56371726680993
<SOS> `` i made my report to the authorities at paris , and a week after he was carried off . '' <EOS>	47.72866485822921

<SOS> `` what can they have done with him ? '' <EOS>	95.1913797189089
<SOS> `` oh , he has been taken to fenestrelles , to pignerol , or to the sainte marguérite islands . <EOS>	72.29018069683222

<SOS> it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it . '' <EOS>	97.3536532829909
<SOS> `` do not be too hasty , m. morrel , '' replied villefort . <EOS>	89.21752499449153
<SOS> `` the order of imprisonment came from high authority , and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source ; and , as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight , the letters have not yet been forwarded . '' <EOS>	68.85735517599105
<SOS> `` but , '' said morrel , `` is there no way of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest ? '' <EOS>	69.88066069174663
<SOS> `` there has been no arrest . '' <EOS>	87.34786335063168
<SOS> `` how ? '' <EOS>	119.19638929451001
<SOS> `` it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man 's disappearance without leaving any traces , so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes . '' <EOS>	73.12689285358056
<SOS> `` it might be so under the bourbons , but at present `` `` it has always been so , my dear morrel , since the reign of louis xiv . <EOS>	97.88903257312742
<SOS> the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself , and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable . '' <EOS>	109.07829622849428
<SOS> had morrel even any suspicions , so much kindness would have dispelled them . <EOS>	77.8429137810925
<SOS> `` well , m. de villefort , how would you advise me to act ? '' <EOS>	66.915467237223
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	66.43090902831625
<SOS> `` petition the minister . '' <EOS>	94.23618078004154
<SOS> `` oh , i know what that is ; the minister receives two hundred petitions every day , and does not read three . '' <EOS>	55.09867922571033
<SOS> `` that is true ; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me . '' <EOS>	96.27008663982471
<SOS> `` and will you undertake to deliver it ? '' <EOS>	71.34319745059551
<SOS> `` with the greatest pleasure . <EOS>	80.58172963713015
<SOS> dantès was then guilty , and now he is innocent , and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him . '' <EOS>	43.30397974671656
<SOS> villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry , which , however improbable it might be , if it did take place would leave him defenceless . <EOS>	58.97810144419894
<SOS> `` but how shall i address the minister ? '' <EOS>	91.823685134876
<SOS> `` sit down there , '' said villefort , giving up his place to morrel , `` and write what i dictate . '' <EOS>	93.38711949141418
<SOS> `` will you be so good ? '' <EOS>	77.3836212744514
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	109.64677050135413
<SOS> but lose no time ; we have lost too much already . '' <EOS>	60.099607595174966
<SOS> `` that is true . <EOS>	80.50124520081289
<SOS> only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering . '' <EOS>	81.83493453788827
<SOS> villefort shuddered at the suggestion ; but he had gone too far to draw back . <EOS>	88.29824142477258
<SOS> dantès must be crushed to gratify villefort 's ambition . <EOS>	122.56083682114482
<SOS> villefort dictated a petition , in which , from an excellent intention , no doubt , dantès ' patriotic services were exaggerated , and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon 's return . <EOS>	50.82572192435863
<SOS> it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him . <EOS>	48.81338635657015
<SOS> the petition finished , villefort read it aloud . <EOS>	69.44575957326704
<SOS> `` that will do , '' said he ; `` leave the rest to me . '' <EOS>	101.10609567529558

<SOS> `` the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition . '' <EOS>	76.9254593611352
<SOS> and , sitting down , villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom . <EOS>	86.55495800613694
<SOS> `` what more is to be done ? '' <EOS>	83.94056926469122
<SOS> `` i will do whatever is necessary . '' <EOS>	74.33210300354867
<SOS> this assurance delighted morrel , who took leave of villefort , and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son . <EOS>	67.24745840315724
<SOS> as for villefort , instead of sending to paris , he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès , in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely , that is , a second restoration . <EOS>	56.443794142628526
<SOS> dantès remained a prisoner , and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii . <EOS>	111.74784753685039
<SOS> 's throne , or the still more tragic destruction of the empire . <EOS>	77.58917493215068
<SOS> twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand , and twice had villefort soothed him with promises . <EOS>	84.82821656242045
<SOS> at last there was waterloo , and morrel came no more ; he had done all that was in his power , and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly . <EOS>	76.2185394291231
<SOS> louis xviii . <EOS>	73.51008376814492
<SOS> remounted the throne ; villefort , to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories , sought and obtained the situation of king 's procureur at toulouse , and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint méran , whose father now stood higher at court than ever . <EOS>	94.78784073602822
<SOS> and so dantès , after the hundred days and after waterloo , remained in his dungeon , forgotten of earth and heaven . <EOS>	79.60983369093421
<SOS> danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès ; and , when napoleon returned to france , he , after the manner of mediocre minds , termed the coincidence , a decree of providence . <EOS>	65.62967075159445
<SOS> but when napoleon returned to paris , danglars ' heart failed him , and he lived in constant fear of dantès ' return on a mission of vengeance . <EOS>	64.76204173058505
<SOS> he therefore informed m. morrel of his wish to quit the sea , and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant , into whose service he entered at the end of march , that is , ten or twelve days after napoleon 's return . <EOS>	62.108717855346384
<SOS> he then left for madrid , and was no more heard of . <EOS>	76.05205926925431
<SOS> fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent . <EOS>	84.6411776603712
<SOS> what had become of him he cared not to inquire . <EOS>	103.04222546310808
<SOS> only , during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him , he reflected , partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence , partly on plans of emigration and abduction , as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo , at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible , watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man , who was for him also the messenger of vengeance . <EOS>	81.49588472052311
<SOS> fernand 's mind was made up ; he would shoot dantès , and then kill himself . <EOS>	48.748773347645525
<SOS> but fernand was mistaken ; a man of his disposition never kills himself , for he constantly hopes . <EOS>	40.6113359648475
<SOS> during this time the empire made its last conscription , and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor . <EOS>	51.45552843466875
<SOS> fernand departed with the rest , bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away , his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès . <EOS>	94.07566808537453
<SOS> had fernand really meant to kill himself , he would have done so when he parted from mercédès . <EOS>	81.91978718469706
<SOS> his devotion , and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes , produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand , and this was now strengthened by gratitude . <EOS>	57.90890781846941
<SOS> `` my brother , '' said she , as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders , `` be careful of yourself , for if you are killed , i shall be alone in the world . '' <EOS>	67.13719754405447

<SOS> bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village . <EOS>	87.66907682506123
<SOS> sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue , looking towards marseilles , at other times gazing on the sea , and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean , and thus end her woes . <EOS>	102.29832121142043
<SOS> it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution ; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her . <EOS>	107.68719197879277

<SOS> there was more than benevolence in this action ; there was courage ; the south was aflame , and to assist , even on his death bed , the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès , was stigmatized as a crime . <EOS>	77.1522376817237
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	107.89769003360298
<SOS> the two prisoners a year after louis xviii . <EOS>	105.55363243499635
<SOS> 's restoration , a visit was made by the inspector general of prisons . <EOS>	71.73914073382859
<SOS> dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation , sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner , who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon . <EOS>	94.30021218153686
<SOS> he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living ; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world , that he looked upon himself as dead . <EOS>	80.06348233454213
<SOS> the inspector visited , one after another , the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners , whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government . <EOS>	59.09662126322507
<SOS> he inquired how they were fed , and if they had any request to make . <EOS>	40.64142887926288
<SOS> the universal response was , that the fare was detestable , and that they wanted to be set free . <EOS>	101.35137718665246
<SOS> the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for . <EOS>	57.510322722472445
<SOS> they shook their heads . <EOS>	78.10845018064894
<SOS> what could they desire beyond their liberty ? <EOS>	71.2082966678548
<SOS> the inspector turned smilingly to the governor . <EOS>	46.65372022292835
<SOS> `` i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits ; when you see one prisoner , you see all , always the same thing , ill fed and innocent . <EOS>	57.35612584610105
<SOS> are there any others ? '' <EOS>	58.52877281569622
<SOS> `` yes ; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons . '' <EOS>	80.30280929967485
<SOS> `` let us visit them , '' said the inspector with an air of fatigue . <EOS>	111.67608464851597
<SOS> `` we must play the farce to the end . <EOS>	75.00784295313315
<SOS> let us see the dungeons . '' <EOS>	43.31667486142366
<SOS> `` let us first send for two soldiers , '' said the governor . <EOS>	70.41958835360177
<SOS> `` the prisoners sometimes , through mere uneasiness of life , and in order to be sentenced to death , commit acts of useless violence , and you might fall a victim . '' <EOS>	67.4884289910934
<SOS> `` take all needful precautions , '' replied the inspector . <EOS>	70.61044970833728
<SOS> two soldiers were accordingly sent for , and the inspector descended a stairway , so foul , so humid , so dark , as to be loathsome to sight , smell , and respiration . <EOS>	82.75064834743534
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried the inspector , `` who can live here ? '' <EOS>	113.97372737867552
<SOS> `` a most dangerous conspirator , a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over , as he is daring and resolute . '' <EOS>	88.64519937739033
<SOS> `` he is alone ? '' <EOS>	66.73928546335145
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	102.46439107527458
<SOS> `` how long has he been there ? '' <EOS>	81.92400169701553
<SOS> `` nearly a year . '' <EOS>	91.74674271991785
<SOS> `` was he placed here when he first arrived ? '' <EOS>	80.67559729070861
<SOS> `` no ; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey , who took his food to him . '' <EOS>	95.98623380385287
<SOS> `` to kill the turnkey ? '' <EOS>	42.33890045623164
<SOS> `` yes , the very one who is lighting us . <EOS>	78.57978687622543
<SOS> is it not true , antoine ? '' <EOS>	90.46373647189785
<SOS> asked the governor . <EOS>	91.01381810324014
<SOS> `` true enough ; he wanted to kill me ! '' <EOS>	111.92675929781304
<SOS> returned the turnkey . <EOS>	70.75682353277864
<SOS> `` he must be mad , '' said the inspector . <EOS>	96.75430186448713
<SOS> `` he is worse than that , he is a devil ! '' <EOS>	90.95649224688924
<SOS> returned the turnkey . <EOS>	97.49420547801513
<SOS> `` shall i complain of him ? '' <EOS>	59.31875151212332
<SOS> demanded the inspector . <EOS>	94.05306829425689
<SOS> `` oh , no ; it is useless . <EOS>	65.0616566322622
<SOS> besides , he is almost mad now , and in another year he will be quite so . '' <EOS>	43.72024841428259
<SOS> `` so much the better for him , he will suffer less , '' said the inspector . <EOS>	107.57293265864185
<SOS> he was , as this remark shows , a man full of philanthropy , and in every way fit for his office . <EOS>	101.02870439870145
<SOS> `` you are right , sir , '' replied the governor ; `` and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject . <EOS>	80.93784359929974
<SOS> now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant , and to which you descend by another stair , an old abbé , formerly leader of a party in italy , who has been here since < num > , and in < num > he went mad , and the change is astonishing . <EOS>	87.64147495160793
<SOS> he used to weep , he now laughs ; he grew thin , he now grows fat . <EOS>	59.145743719021034
<SOS> you had better see him , for his madness is amusing . '' <EOS>	87.61547085260203
<SOS> `` i will see them both , '' returned the inspector ; `` i must conscientiously perform my duty . '' <EOS>	101.5456564930691
<SOS> this was the inspector 's first visit ; he wished to display his authority . <EOS>	65.29687838231733
<SOS> `` let us visit this one first , '' added he . <EOS>	91.69184439012375
<SOS> `` by all means , '' replied the governor , and he signed to the turnkey to open the door . <EOS>	112.4456387274562
<SOS> at the sound of the key turning in the lock , and the creaking of the hinges , dantès , who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon , whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above , raised his head . <EOS>	49.139589347113045
<SOS> seeing a stranger , escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers , and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded , dantès , who guessed the truth , and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come , sprang forward with clasped hands . <EOS>	97.4757766262128
<SOS> the soldiers interposed their bayonets , for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector , and the latter recoiled two or three steps . <EOS>	57.89464713443605
<SOS> dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous . <EOS>	71.71690685823572
<SOS> then , infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice , he addressed the inspector , and sought to inspire him with pity . <EOS>	64.40725605276118
<SOS> the inspector listened attentively ; then , turning to the governor , observed , `` he will become religious he is already more gentle ; he is afraid , and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything ; i made some curious observations on this at charenton . '' <EOS>	67.85918329194885
<SOS> then , turning to the prisoner , `` what is it you want ? '' <EOS>	61.109948035748644
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	59.16654005960429
<SOS> `` i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried ; and if i am guilty , to be shot ; if innocent , to be set at liberty . '' <EOS>	102.39489505130129
<SOS> `` are you well fed ? '' <EOS>	64.28698803713621
<SOS> said the inspector . <EOS>	75.45927454250487
<SOS> `` i believe so ; i do n't know ; it 's of no consequence . <EOS>	62.423534468646416
<SOS> what matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should languish in prison , the victim of an infamous denunciation , to die here cursing his executioners . '' <EOS>	74.03532935594593
<SOS> `` you are very humble today , '' remarked the governor ; `` you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey . '' <EOS>	50.010531235901134
<SOS> `` it is true , sir , and i beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but i was mad . '' <EOS>	98.412922408654
<SOS> `` and you are not so any longer ? '' <EOS>	56.84420301216307
<SOS> `` no ; captivity has subdued me i have been here so long . '' <EOS>	91.67575193821165
<SOS> `` so long ? <EOS>	94.38334128299192
<SOS> when were you arrested , then ? '' <EOS>	61.34864799263856
<SOS> asked the inspector . <EOS>	54.578303247883284
<SOS> `` the < num > th of february , < num > , at half past two in the afternoon . '' <EOS>	108.57458386381998
<SOS> `` today is the < num > th of july , < num > , why , it is but seventeen months . '' <EOS>	48.09367333818314
<SOS> `` only seventeen months , '' replied dantès . <EOS>	60.48973118313136
<SOS> `` oh , you do not know what is seventeen months in prison ! <EOS>	84.00729387910216
<SOS> seventeen ages rather , especially to a man who , like me , had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a man , who , like me , was on the point of marrying a woman he adored , who saw an honorable career opened before him , and who loses all in an instant who sees his prospects destroyed , and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife , and whether his aged father be still living ! <EOS>	64.36693503894466
<SOS> seventeen months ' captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean , is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited . <EOS>	76.09849823029347
<SOS> have pity on me , then , and ask for me , not intelligence , but a trial ; not pardon , but a verdict a trial , sir , i ask only for a trial ; that , surely , can not be denied to one who is accused ! '' <EOS>	69.76958959126209
<SOS> `` we shall see , '' said the inspector ; then , turning to the governor , `` on my word , the poor devil touches me . <EOS>	53.19614021190321
<SOS> you must show me the proofs against him . '' <EOS>	75.71291714118263
<SOS> `` certainly ; but you will find terrible charges . '' <EOS>	64.7626229719876
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' continued dantès , `` i know it is not in your power to release me ; but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask . <EOS>	72.46918438056457
<SOS> let me know my crime , and the reason why i was condemned . <EOS>	67.90838632068554
<SOS> uncertainty is worse than all . '' <EOS>	67.54957266227572
<SOS> `` go on with the lights , '' said the inspector . <EOS>	41.03633196588706
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' cried dantès , `` i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity ; tell me at least to hope . '' <EOS>	57.86711991443577
<SOS> `` i can not tell you that , '' replied the inspector ; `` i can only promise to examine into your case . '' <EOS>	53.064812631970184
<SOS> `` oh , i am free then i am saved ! '' <EOS>	49.31922814869993
<SOS> `` who arrested you ? '' <EOS>	80.06145599978142
<SOS> `` m. villefort . <EOS>	74.67706450278328
<SOS> see him , and hear what he says . '' <EOS>	70.61568976097044
<SOS> `` m. villefort is no longer at marseilles ; he is now at toulouse . '' <EOS>	71.32610309344712
<SOS> `` i am no longer surprised at my detention , '' murmured dantès , `` since my only protector is removed . '' <EOS>	100.98263917785509
<SOS> `` had m. de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you ? '' <EOS>	84.12892125587878
<SOS> `` none ; on the contrary , he was very kind to me . '' <EOS>	102.49316767817973
<SOS> `` i can , then , rely on the notes he has left concerning you ? '' <EOS>	67.3393502293747
<SOS> `` entirely . '' <EOS>	75.88598667836322
<SOS> `` that is well ; wait patiently , then . '' <EOS>	80.09544477437657
<SOS> dantès fell on his knees , and prayed earnestly . <EOS>	52.229511946501574
<SOS> the door closed ; but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantès hope . <EOS>	44.68903873319865
<SOS> < num > m `` will you see the register at once , '' asked the governor , `` or proceed to the other cell ? '' <EOS>	65.5782537549024
<SOS> `` let us visit them all , '' said the inspector . <EOS>	51.86225014755718
<SOS> `` if i once went up those stairs . <EOS>	95.3117377932038
<SOS> i should never have the courage to come down again . '' <EOS>	75.15482035031908
<SOS> `` ah , this one is not like the other , and his madness is less affecting than this one 's display of reason . '' <EOS>	73.2166979602336
<SOS> `` what is his folly ? '' <EOS>	87.4066931621964
<SOS> `` he fancies he possesses an immense treasure . <EOS>	101.07974384159935
<SOS> the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release ; the second , two ; the third , three ; and so on progressively . <EOS>	92.4772344715442
<SOS> he is now in his fifth year of captivity ; he will ask to speak to you in private , and offer you five millions . '' <EOS>	50.64241448564726
<SOS> `` how curious ! <EOS>	65.34883380646897
<SOS> what is his name ? '' <EOS>	52.181388135926134
<SOS> `` the abbé faria . '' <EOS>	62.80617744385414
<SOS> `` no . <EOS>	74.70008390266042
<SOS> < num > , '' said the inspector . <EOS>	56.602921764920616
<SOS> `` it is here ; unlock the door , antoine . '' <EOS>	77.24191685485978
<SOS> the turnkey obeyed , and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbé , as the prisoner was usually called . <EOS>	53.25514715578487
<SOS> in the centre of the cell , in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall , sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him . <EOS>	83.92248905572795
<SOS> he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines , and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him . <EOS>	108.55615354837424
<SOS> he did not move at the sound of the door , and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell ; then , raising his head , he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present . <EOS>	85.84846180735767
<SOS> he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed , and wrapped it round him . <EOS>	68.13762431650518
<SOS> `` what is it you want ? '' <EOS>	75.36537547104331
<SOS> said the inspector . <EOS>	51.40000031298346
<SOS> `` i , monsieur , '' replied the abbé with an air of surprise , `` i want nothing . '' <EOS>	85.42757972771972
<SOS> `` you do not understand , '' continued the inspector ; `` i am sent here by government to visit the prison , and hear the requests of the prisoners . '' <EOS>	96.15360418846076
<SOS> `` oh , that is different , '' cried the abbé ; `` and we shall understand each other , i hope . '' <EOS>	117.2999672982818
<SOS> `` there , now , '' whispered the governor , `` it is just as i told you . '' <EOS>	44.58693876938159
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' continued the prisoner , `` i am the abbé faria , born at rome . <EOS>	56.3395611507259
<SOS> i was for twenty years cardinal spada 's secretary ; i was arrested , why , i know not , toward the beginning of the year < num > ; since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government . '' <EOS>	73.0417836290582
<SOS> `` why from the french government ? '' <EOS>	105.9972705455371
<SOS> `` because i was arrested at piombino , and i presume that , like milan and florence , piombino has become the capital of some french department . '' <EOS>	106.13647220063096
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the inspector , `` you have not the latest news from italy ? '' <EOS>	107.32609865016167
<SOS> `` my information dates from the day on which i was arrested , '' returned the abbé faria ; `` and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son , i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia , which was to make italy a united kingdom . '' <EOS>	61.8671470324412
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' returned the inspector , `` providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly . '' <EOS>	66.9460020705269
<SOS> `` it is the only means of rendering italy strong , happy , and independent . '' <EOS>	100.9906657423662
<SOS> `` very possibly ; only i am not come to discuss politics , but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of . '' <EOS>	65.00670137269542
<SOS> `` the food is the same as in other prisons , that is , very bad ; the lodging is very unhealthful , but , on the whole , passable for a dungeon ; but it is not that which i wish to speak of , but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance . '' <EOS>	70.50974008213102
<SOS> `` we are coming to the point , '' whispered the governor . <EOS>	100.86907517448242
<SOS> `` it is for that reason i am delighted to see you , '' continued the abbé , `` although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation , which , if it succeeded , would possibly change newton 's system . <EOS>	70.36746046602877
<SOS> could you allow me a few words in private . '' <EOS>	97.2049467755351
<SOS> `` what did i tell you ? '' <EOS>	66.21271255163344
<SOS> said the governor . <EOS>	64.72404358250115
<SOS> `` you knew him , '' returned the inspector with a smile . <EOS>	92.65737090912695
<SOS> `` what you ask is impossible , monsieur , '' continued he , addressing faria . <EOS>	77.47234957641437
<SOS> < num > m `` but , '' said the abbé , `` i would speak to you of a large sum , amounting to five millions . '' <EOS>	93.62319654678232
<SOS> `` the very sum you named , '' whispered the inspector in his turn . <EOS>	61.211755687663484
<SOS> `` however , '' continued faria , seeing that the inspector was about to depart , `` it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone ; the governor can be present . '' <EOS>	53.97439386736228
<SOS> `` unfortunately , '' said the governor , `` i know beforehand what you are about to say ; it concerns your treasures , does it not ? '' <EOS>	113.43115630117157
<SOS> faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity . <EOS>	93.09740814034262
<SOS> `` of course , '' said he ; `` of what else should i speak ? '' <EOS>	93.74725163792233
<SOS> `` mr . <EOS>	48.27439378042749
<SOS> inspector , '' continued the governor , `` i can tell you the story as well as he , for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years . '' <EOS>	61.720747216541454
<SOS> `` that proves , '' returned the abbé , `` that you are like those of holy writ , who having eyes see not , and having ears hear not . '' <EOS>	60.419202848612976
<SOS> `` my dear sir , the government is rich and does not want your treasures , '' replied the inspector ; `` keep them until you are liberated . '' <EOS>	63.26083019213383
<SOS> the abbé 's eyes glistened ; he seized the inspector 's hand . <EOS>	68.05876392396287
<SOS> `` but what if i am not liberated , '' cried he , `` and am detained here until my death ? <EOS>	83.38513885931445
<SOS> this treasure will be lost . <EOS>	52.10351187494662
<SOS> had not government better profit by it ? <EOS>	81.38575088387171
<SOS> i will offer six millions , and i will content myself with the rest , if they will only give me my liberty . '' <EOS>	46.986349783753916
<SOS> `` on my word , '' said the inspector in a low tone , `` had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad , i should believe what he says . '' <EOS>	78.34820264983975
<SOS> `` i am not mad , '' replied faria , with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners . <EOS>	69.73790427225828
<SOS> `` the treasure i speak of really exists , and i offer to sign an agreement with you , in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig ; and if i deceive you , bring me here again , i ask no more . '' <EOS>	51.15037129976047
<SOS> the governor laughed . <EOS>	91.41302905921546
<SOS> `` is the spot far from here ? '' <EOS>	99.40541981680772
<SOS> `` a hundred leagues . '' <EOS>	66.96047069528116
<SOS> `` it is not ill planned , '' said the governor . <EOS>	50.70144569679918
<SOS> `` if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues , and their guardians consented to accompany them , they would have a capital chance of escaping . '' <EOS>	42.873255692136134
<SOS> `` the scheme is well known , '' said the inspector ; `` and the abbé 's plan has not even the merit of originality . '' <EOS>	118.1325282854325
<SOS> then turning to faria , `` i inquired if you are well fed ? '' <EOS>	56.68916949936798
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	76.56965187334156
<SOS> `` swear to me , '' replied faria , `` to free me if what i tell you prove true , and i will stay here while you go to the spot . '' <EOS>	96.10242250879132
<SOS> `` are you well fed ? '' <EOS>	68.08382096184307
<SOS> repeated the inspector . <EOS>	66.78685895411111
<SOS> `` monsieur , you run no risk , for , as i told you , i will stay here ; so there is no chance of my escaping . '' <EOS>	83.73372974474273
<SOS> `` you do not reply to my question , '' replied the inspector impatiently . <EOS>	58.15458851510842
<SOS> `` nor you to mine , '' cried the abbé . <EOS>	68.35723108051178
<SOS> `` you will not accept my gold ; i will keep it for myself . <EOS>	78.47807487756481
<SOS> you refuse me my liberty ; god will give it me . '' <EOS>	54.86160250210635
<SOS> and the abbé , casting away his coverlet , resumed his place , and continued his calculations . <EOS>	78.23655236450296
<SOS> < num > m `` what is he doing there ? '' <EOS>	39.096061343318524
<SOS> said the inspector . <EOS>	67.00663569896872
<SOS> `` counting his treasures , '' replied the governor . <EOS>	70.91094684951426
<SOS> faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt . <EOS>	64.27476893589014
<SOS> they went out . <EOS>	55.05828973373132
<SOS> the turnkey closed the door behind them . <EOS>	95.6079352345191
<SOS> `` he was wealthy once , perhaps ? '' <EOS>	75.08651978915498
<SOS> said the inspector . <EOS>	81.64579703777923
<SOS> `` or dreamed he was , and awoke mad . '' <EOS>	66.26227295386461
<SOS> `` after all , '' said the inspector , `` if he had been rich , he would not have been here . '' <EOS>	99.43433813578636
<SOS> so the matter ended for the abbé faria . <EOS>	67.25795000160882
<SOS> he remained in his cell , and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity . <EOS>	43.410335527668565
<SOS> caligula or nero , those treasure seekers , those desirers of the impossible , would have accorded to the poor wretch , in exchange for his wealth , the liberty he so earnestly prayed for . <EOS>	62.15773959238604
<SOS> but the kings of modern times , restrained by the limits of mere probability , have neither courage nor desire . <EOS>	56.6788999683818
<SOS> they fear the ear that hears their orders , and the eye that scrutinizes their actions . <EOS>	48.44735663288274
<SOS> formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter , and shielded by their birth ; but nowadays they are not inviolable . <EOS>	57.706717655616444
<SOS> it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear . <EOS>	47.45337190459297
<SOS> as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture , so madness is always concealed in its cell , from whence , should it depart , it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital , where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him . <EOS>	79.57423311086218
<SOS> the very madness of the abbé faria , gone mad in prison , condemned him to perpetual captivity . <EOS>	92.30375616501905
<SOS> the inspector kept his word with dantès ; he examined the register , and found the following note concerning him : edmond dantès : violent bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from elba . <EOS>	54.11796849118128
<SOS> the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised . <EOS>	61.487499360812215
<SOS> this note was in a different hand from the rest , which showed that it had been added since his confinement . <EOS>	108.28153484054157
<SOS> the inspector could not contend against this accusation ; he simply wrote , nothing to be done . <EOS>	103.03791119395487
<SOS> this visit had infused new vigor into dantès ; he had , till then , forgotten the date ; but now , with a fragment of plaster , he wrote the date , < num > th july , < num > , and made a mark every day , in order not to lose his reckoning again . <EOS>	53.903953217848716
<SOS> days and weeks passed away , then months dantès still waited ; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight . <EOS>	56.389565043036896
<SOS> this fortnight expired , he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris , and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished , he therefore fixed three months ; three months passed away , then six more . <EOS>	79.77935978447255
<SOS> finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place , and dantès began to fancy the inspector 's visit but a dream , an illusion of the brain . <EOS>	58.609637387665586
<SOS> at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred ; he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham . <EOS>	74.26109726313439
<SOS> he took with him several of his subordinates , and amongst them dantès ' jailer . <EOS>	111.00466308811104
<SOS> a new governor arrived ; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners ; he learned their numbers instead . <EOS>	66.7304954075562
<SOS> this horrible place contained fifty cells ; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell , and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantès he was now number < num > . <EOS>	41.64874096791664
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	52.73640163458507
<SOS> number < num > and number < num > dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense . <EOS>	63.504193499022925
<SOS> he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope ; then he began to doubt his own innocence , which justified in some measure the governor 's belief in his mental alienation ; and then , relaxing his sentiment of pride , he addressed his supplications , not to god , but to man . <EOS>	83.9679388216006
<SOS> god is always the last resource . <EOS>	50.83129272601177
<SOS> unfortunates , who ought to begin with god , do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance . <EOS>	92.0573986047221
<SOS> dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another , even if it were darker and deeper , for a change , however disadvantageous , was still a change , and would afford him some amusement . <EOS>	47.1787100019654
<SOS> he entreated to be allowed to walk about , to have fresh air , books , and writing materials . <EOS>	80.11988843109839
<SOS> his requests were not granted , but he went on asking all the same . <EOS>	79.96972773789884
<SOS> he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer , although the latter was , if possible , more taciturn than the old one ; but still , to speak to a man , even though mute , was something . <EOS>	83.66607595103083
<SOS> dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice ; he had tried to speak when alone , but the sound of his voice terrified him . <EOS>	74.246395398637
<SOS> often , before his captivity , dantès ' mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners , made up of thieves , vagabonds , and murderers . <EOS>	107.37685160001064
<SOS> he now wished to be amongst them , in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer ; he sighed for the galleys , with the infamous costume , the chain , and the brand on the shoulder . <EOS>	83.37359875396511
<SOS> the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven , and saw each other . <EOS>	69.08963445604272
<SOS> they were very happy . <EOS>	85.84882440373327
<SOS> he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion , were it even the mad abbé . <EOS>	65.0348809364653
<SOS> the jailer , though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering , was yet a man . <EOS>	118.50729707006728
<SOS> at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so ; and he laid the request of number < num > before the governor ; but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape , and refused his request . <EOS>	83.44616050681049
<SOS> dantès had exhausted all human resources , and he then turned to god . <EOS>	58.11584353896971
<SOS> all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten , returned ; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him , and discovered a new meaning in every word ; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words , until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven ! <EOS>	72.31234759594341
<SOS> he prayed , and prayed aloud , no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice , for he fell into a sort of ecstasy . <EOS>	64.57069884001595
<SOS> he laid every action of his life before the almighty , proposed tasks to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god : `` forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us . '' <EOS>	70.90837176693657
<SOS> yet in spite of his earnest prayers , dantès remained a prisoner . <EOS>	56.499639574853845
<SOS> then gloom settled heavily upon him . <EOS>	85.70219353861583
<SOS> dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought , and without education ; he could not , therefore , in the solitude of his dungeon , traverse in mental vision the history of the ages , bring to life the nations that had perished , and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination , and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin 's babylonian pictures . <EOS>	73.20936644691142
<SOS> he could not do this , he whose past life was so short , whose present so melancholy , and his future so doubtful . <EOS>	70.75008316130683
<SOS> nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness ! <EOS>	57.84809242973256
<SOS> no distraction could come to his aid ; his energetic spirit , that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past , was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage . <EOS>	59.92799614887997
<SOS> he clung to one idea that of his happiness , destroyed , without apparent cause , by an unheard of fatality ; he considered and reconsidered this idea , devoured it ( so to speak ) , as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante . <EOS>	90.47492242522132
<SOS> rage supplanted religious fervor . <EOS>	59.07177121691999
<SOS> dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror , dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison , wreaked his anger upon everything , and chiefly upon himself , so that the least thing , a grain of sand , a straw , or a breath of air that annoyed him , led to paroxysms of fury . <EOS>	81.58269883323685
<SOS> then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind , and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene , mene , tekel upharsin of belshazzar . <EOS>	51.74675008696171
<SOS> he told himself that it was the enmity of man , and not the vengeance of heaven , that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery . <EOS>	85.41574903220841
<SOS> he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine , and found them all insufficient , because after torture came death , and after death , if not repose , at least the boon of unconsciousness . <EOS>	118.09771493130218
<SOS> by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death , and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented , he began to reflect on suicide . <EOS>	97.73150350293635
<SOS> unhappy he , who , on the brink of misfortune , broods over ideas like these ! <EOS>	86.36075892155228
<SOS> before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye ; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition . <EOS>	64.17474139644018
<SOS> once thus ensnared , unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence , all is over , and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction . <EOS>	103.63210732147748
<SOS> this state of mental anguish is , however , less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow . <EOS>	65.54509789530789
<SOS> there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss , at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity . <EOS>	68.41201738017857
<SOS> edmond found some solace in these ideas . <EOS>	72.5324392366796
<SOS> all his sorrows , all his sufferings , with their train of gloomy spectres , fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter . <EOS>	50.78894618464332
<SOS> dantès reviewed his past life with composure , and , looking forward with terror to his future existence , chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge . <EOS>	87.35792127543512
<SOS> `` sometimes , '' said he , `` in my voyages , when i was a man and commanded other men , i have seen the heavens overcast , the sea rage and foam , the storm arise , and , like a monstrous bird , beating the two horizons with its wings . <EOS>	49.43842100696686
<SOS> then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge , that trembled and shook before the tempest . <EOS>	72.29468021956733
<SOS> soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death , and death then terrified me , and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god . <EOS>	73.023410842304
<SOS> but i did so because i was happy , because i had not courted death , because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible , because i was unwilling that i , a creature made for the service of god , should serve for food to the gulls and ravens . <EOS>	60.866326733712654
<SOS> but now it is different ; i have lost all that bound me to life , death smiles and invites me to repose ; i die after my own manner , i die exhausted and broken spirited , as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell , that is thirty thousand steps , or about ten leagues . '' <EOS>	69.13692317896336
<SOS> no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed , arranged his couch to the best of his power , ate little and slept less , and found existence almost supportable , because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure , like a worn out garment . <EOS>	111.70370765229819
<SOS> two methods of self destruction were at his disposal . <EOS>	89.99730255190728
<SOS> he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars , or refuse food and die of starvation . <EOS>	80.51905284341781
<SOS> but the first was repugnant to him . <EOS>	65.04483285109303
<SOS> dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates , who are hung up to the yard arm ; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death . <EOS>	58.25053330200781
<SOS> he resolved to adopt the second , and began that day to carry out his resolve . <EOS>	81.88396705757549
<SOS> < num > m nearly four years had passed away ; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time . <EOS>	86.09206880621433
<SOS> dantès said , `` i wish to die , '' and had chosen the manner of his death , and fearful of changing his mind , he had taken an oath to die . <EOS>	118.47358915370923
<SOS> `` when my morning and evening meals are brought , '' thought he , `` i will cast them out of the window , and they will think that i have eaten them . '' <EOS>	90.4840537760532
<SOS> he kept his word ; twice a day he cast out , through the barred aperture , the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly , then with deliberation , and at last with regret . <EOS>	88.29344884006215
<SOS> nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed . <EOS>	84.30768594170725
<SOS> hunger made viands once repugnant , now acceptable ; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time , and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat , of tainted fish , of black and mouldy bread . <EOS>	60.80168296813325
<SOS> it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair ; then his dungeon seemed less sombre , his prospects less desperate . <EOS>	69.77990279748269
<SOS> he was still young he was only four or five and twenty he had nearly fifty years to live . <EOS>	43.75349055232087
<SOS> what unforseen events might not open his prison door , and restore him to liberty ? <EOS>	114.00784327464743
<SOS> then he raised to his lips the repast that , like a voluntary tantalus , he refused himself ; but he thought of his oath , and he would not break it . <EOS>	84.85858450908803
<SOS> he persisted until , at last , he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole . <EOS>	42.67344119937105
<SOS> the next morning he could not see or hear ; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. edmond hoped he was dying . <EOS>	87.92779541505895
<SOS> thus the day passed away . <EOS>	64.1651304076188
<SOS> edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content ; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased ; his thirst had abated ; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o ' the wisps that play about the marshes . <EOS>	88.8847523091444
<SOS> it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death ! <EOS>	73.08834578947096
<SOS> suddenly , about nine o'clock in the evening , edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying . <EOS>	84.03346329797694
<SOS> so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison , that their noise did not , in general , awake him ; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties , or whether the noise was really louder than usual , edmond raised his head and listened . <EOS>	81.62157800652795
<SOS> it was a continual scratching , as if made by a huge claw , a powerful tooth , or some iron instrument attacking the stones . <EOS>	78.90386484114433
<SOS> although weakened , the young man 's brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty ! <EOS>	74.77859151942017
<SOS> it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him , and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss . <EOS>	67.85698050805013
<SOS> perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him , and striving to diminish the distance that separated them . <EOS>	84.21841459161283
<SOS> no , no , doubtless he was deceived , and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death ! <EOS>	42.879055326656584
<SOS> edmond still heard the sound . <EOS>	64.8316982106995
<SOS> it lasted nearly three hours ; he then heard a noise of something falling , and all was silent . <EOS>	116.04277338839385
<SOS> some hours afterwards it began again , nearer and more distinct . <EOS>	70.46039594529395
<SOS> edmond was intensely interested . <EOS>	79.75515131484458
<SOS> suddenly the jailer entered . <EOS>	40.459351229549014
<SOS> for a week since he had resolved to die , and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose , edmond had not spoken to the attendant , had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him , and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him ; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it , and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments . <EOS>	44.018719936950816
<SOS> the jailer brought him his breakfast . <EOS>	60.20312314022943
<SOS> dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything ; about the bad quality of the food , about the coldness of his dungeon , grumbling and complaining , in order to have an excuse for speaking louder , and wearying the patience of his jailer , who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner . <EOS>	80.20449459713019
<SOS> fortunately , he fancied that dantès was delirious ; and placing the food on the rickety table , he withdrew . <EOS>	75.2485573584632
<SOS> edmond listened , and the sound became more and more distinct . <EOS>	79.46146843502153
<SOS> `` there can be no doubt about it , '' thought he ; `` it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom . <EOS>	95.2066351090848
<SOS> oh , if i were only there to help him ! '' <EOS>	77.53937135773393
<SOS> suddenly another idea took possession of his mind , so used to misfortune , that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon . <EOS>	93.3581788901536
<SOS> it was easy to ascertain this ; but how could he risk the question ? <EOS>	58.45012630353052
<SOS> it was easy to call his jailer 's attention to the noise , and watch his countenance as he listened ; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity ? <EOS>	72.90253241883384
<SOS> unfortunately , edmond 's brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular . <EOS>	65.61308719953234
<SOS> he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment . <EOS>	96.8732727744156
<SOS> he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought , rose , staggered towards it , raised the vessel to his lips , and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure . <EOS>	96.07762356931472
<SOS> he had the resolution to stop with this . <EOS>	90.71138675716104
<SOS> he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food . <EOS>	88.94902874968898
<SOS> edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour , and returned to his couch he did not wish to die . <EOS>	55.03506049057968
<SOS> he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think , and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning . <EOS>	78.52598986666219
<SOS> then he said to himself : `` i must put this to the test , but without compromising anybody . <EOS>	68.21560141554521
<SOS> if it is a workman , i need but knock against the wall , and he will cease to work , in order to find out who is knocking , and why he does so ; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor , he will soon resume it . <EOS>	81.53340806186252
<SOS> if , on the contrary , it is a prisoner , the noise i make will alarm him , he will cease , and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep . '' <EOS>	100.95351170060076
<SOS> edmond rose again , but this time his legs did not tremble , and his sight was clear ; he went to a corner of his dungeon , detached a stone , and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came . <EOS>	97.3792877075431
<SOS> he struck thrice . <EOS>	71.40989344923321
<SOS> at the first blow the sound ceased , as if by magic . <EOS>	76.64868192296719
<SOS> edmond listened intently ; an hour passed , two hours passed , and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there . <EOS>	88.31521794674912
<SOS> full of hope , edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water , and , thanks to the vigor of his constitution , found himself well nigh recovered . <EOS>	77.86566614168632
<SOS> the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise . <EOS>	55.37039590482303
<SOS> `` it is a prisoner , '' said edmond joyfully . <EOS>	70.16477953623391
<SOS> his brain was on fire , and life and energy returned . <EOS>	43.920425966554426
<SOS> the night passed in perfect silence . <EOS>	103.63240098514594
<SOS> edmond did not close his eyes . <EOS>	103.63220308851331
<SOS> in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day ; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound , walking round and round his cell , shaking the iron bars of the loophole , restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise , and so preparing himself for his future destiny . <EOS>	88.21728187166087
<SOS> at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again , and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner , who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself . <EOS>	89.50192762876482
<SOS> three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes ! <EOS>	77.64258058195125
<SOS> at length one evening , as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night , dantès , with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall , fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones . <EOS>	98.33501507615463
<SOS> he moved away , walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts , and then went back and listened . <EOS>	75.08212617976035
<SOS> the matter was no longer doubtful . <EOS>	66.82997446465582
<SOS> something was at work on the other side of the wall ; the prisoner had discovered the danger , and had substituted a lever for a chisel . <EOS>	73.45271928800473
<SOS> encouraged by this discovery , edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer . <EOS>	110.89373524677865
<SOS> he began by moving his bed , and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall , penetrate the moist cement , and displace a stone . <EOS>	71.46791464961863
<SOS> he saw nothing , he had no knife or sharp instrument , the window grating was of iron , but he had too often assured himself of its solidity . <EOS>	57.29414882447868
<SOS> all his furniture consisted of a bed , a chair , a table , a pail , and a jug . <EOS>	57.79452884287829
<SOS> the bed had iron clamps , but they were screwed to the wood , and it would have required a screw driver to take them off . <EOS>	71.18548101202809
<SOS> the table and chair had nothing , the pail had once possessed a handle , but that had been removed . <EOS>	101.09195198599822
<SOS> < num > m dantès had but one resource , which was to break the jug , and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall . <EOS>	81.1895565514554
<SOS> he let the jug fall on the floor , and it broke in pieces . <EOS>	54.05487572339
<SOS> dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed , leaving the rest on the floor . <EOS>	59.36548029984717
<SOS> the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion . <EOS>	49.393628767037534
<SOS> edmond had all the night to work in , but in the darkness he could not do much , and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard ; he pushed back his bed , and waited for day . <EOS>	100.05900195885164
<SOS> all night he heard the subterranean workman , who continued to mine his way . <EOS>	75.64800355893628
<SOS> day came , the jailer entered . <EOS>	74.59284145215429
<SOS> dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking , and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another , without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one . <EOS>	80.79799454127374
<SOS> he returned speedily , advised the prisoner to be more careful , and departed . <EOS>	53.04014850158205
<SOS> dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock ; he listened until the sound of steps died away , and then , hastily displacing his bed , saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell , that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it . <EOS>	85.36714523210921
<SOS> the damp had rendered it friable , and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels , it is true , but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful ; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years , supposing that the rock was not encountered , a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad , might be formed . <EOS>	91.3077822726357
<SOS> the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes , prayer , and despondency . <EOS>	93.35329073286785
<SOS> during the six years that he had been imprisoned , what might he not have accomplished ? <EOS>	69.01799153179834
<SOS> this idea imparted new energy , and in three days he had succeeded , with the utmost precaution , in removing the cement , and exposing the stone work . <EOS>	70.83770879873194
<SOS> the wall was built of rough stones , among which , to give strength to the structure , blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded . <EOS>	91.27760350312897
<SOS> it was one of these he had uncovered , and which he must remove from its socket . <EOS>	95.89730449877983
<SOS> dantès strove to do this with his nails , but they were too weak . <EOS>	62.533360947425614
<SOS> the fragments of the jug broke , and after an hour of useless toil , dantès paused with anguish on his brow . <EOS>	75.28535498259154
<SOS> was he to be thus stopped at the beginning , and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task ? <EOS>	117.11454849276937
<SOS> suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled , and the perspiration dried on his forehead . <EOS>	81.24790052091001
<SOS> the jailer always brought dantès ' soup in an iron saucepan ; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners , for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full , or half empty , according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first . <EOS>	70.25135210279971
<SOS> the handle of this saucepan was of iron ; dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it . <EOS>	60.826542633904005
<SOS> < num > m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès ' plate , and dantès , after eating his soup with a wooden spoon , washed the plate , which thus served for every day . <EOS>	44.636942462239695
<SOS> now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door ; the jailer , as he entered , stepped on it and broke it . <EOS>	64.21493035952881
<SOS> this time he could not blame dantès . <EOS>	61.592527990369426
<SOS> he was wrong to leave it there , but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him . <EOS>	91.56109469786271
<SOS> the jailer , therefore , only grumbled . <EOS>	56.96677601358492
<SOS> then he looked about for something to pour the soup into ; dantès ' entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative . <EOS>	92.15270989831541
<SOS> `` leave the saucepan , '' said dantès ; `` you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast . '' <EOS>	92.84246811076649
<SOS> this advice was to the jailer 's taste , as it spared him the necessity of making another trip . <EOS>	107.38372950892443
<SOS> he left the saucepan . <EOS>	77.60042753140583
<SOS> dantès was beside himself with joy . <EOS>	102.8941176786903
<SOS> he rapidly devoured his food , and after waiting an hour , lest the jailer should change his mind and return , he removed his bed , took the handle of the saucepan , inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall , and employed it as a lever . <EOS>	77.96911209877608
<SOS> a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well . <EOS>	92.40846310870008
<SOS> at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall , leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter . <EOS>	86.03537395941883
<SOS> dantès carefully collected the plaster , carried it into the corner of his cell , and covered it with earth . <EOS>	66.23122302369364
<SOS> then , wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor , he continued to work without ceasing . <EOS>	92.39201151858686
<SOS> at the dawn of day he replaced the stone , pushed his bed against the wall , and lay down . <EOS>	104.5056872918226
<SOS> the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread ; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table . <EOS>	57.80179937250284
<SOS> `` well , do n't you intend to bring me another plate ? '' <EOS>	83.51820050501323
<SOS> said dantès . <EOS>	74.15952668161049
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the turnkey ; `` you destroy everything . <EOS>	60.865971003941
<SOS> first you break your jug , then you make me break your plate ; if all the prisoners followed your example , the government would be ruined . <EOS>	58.78837199212902
<SOS> i shall leave you the saucepan , and pour your soup into that . <EOS>	78.58849101863622
<SOS> so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive . '' <EOS>	74.1230523560878
<SOS> dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet . <EOS>	63.06487827381348
<SOS> he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything . <EOS>	74.16402403483197
<SOS> he had noticed , however , that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor ; no matter , this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him , he would go to his neighbor . <EOS>	51.987774079052805
<SOS> all day he toiled on untiringly , and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone . <EOS>	76.38029694345632
<SOS> when the hour for his jailer 's visit arrived , dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could , and placed it in its accustomed place . <EOS>	75.68954011827437
<SOS> the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it , together with the fish for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat . <EOS>	74.18042638199151
<SOS> this would have been a method of reckoning time , had not dantès long ceased to do so . <EOS>	41.09534192165775
<SOS> having poured out the soup , the turnkey retired . <EOS>	92.60220427448415
<SOS> dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work . <EOS>	70.89200932953992
<SOS> he listened all was silent , as it had been for the last three days . <EOS>	80.25527522055188
<SOS> dantès sighed ; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him . <EOS>	51.39689528280529
<SOS> however , he toiled on all the night without being discouraged ; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle . <EOS>	99.2633646601726
<SOS> the iron made no impression , but met with a smooth surface ; dantès touched it , and found that it was a beam . <EOS>	86.00599338880619
<SOS> this beam crossed , or rather blocked up , the hole dantès had made ; it was necessary , therefore , to dig above or under it . <EOS>	86.11080429109317
<SOS> the unhappy young man had not thought of this . <EOS>	110.07071161649937
<SOS> `` oh , my god , my god ! '' <EOS>	98.32750245754093
<SOS> murmured he , `` i have so earnestly prayed to you , that i hoped my prayers had been heard . <EOS>	52.08190533162931
<SOS> after having deprived me of my liberty , after having deprived me of death , after having recalled me to existence , my god , have pity on me , and do not let me die in despair ! '' <EOS>	83.67265299888767
<SOS> < num > m `` who talks of god and despair at the same time ? '' <EOS>	74.01001934751022
<SOS> said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth , and , deadened by the distance , sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man 's ears . <EOS>	72.94678716796787
<SOS> edmond 's hair stood on end , and he rose to his knees . <EOS>	69.80107456132343
<SOS> `` ah , '' said he , `` i hear a human voice . '' <EOS>	77.30319724020754
<SOS> edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years ; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner he is a living door , a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron . <EOS>	59.999618591623516
<SOS> `` in the name of heaven , '' cried dantès , `` speak again , though the sound of your voice terrifies me . <EOS>	77.77857729546167
<SOS> who are you ? '' <EOS>	84.08738806015322
<SOS> `` who are you ? '' <EOS>	78.54096968975777
<SOS> said the voice . <EOS>	44.901268723989055
<SOS> `` an unhappy prisoner , '' replied dantès , who made no hesitation in answering . <EOS>	67.45839895639313
<SOS> `` of what country ? '' <EOS>	113.66562935561205
<SOS> `` a frenchman . '' <EOS>	102.16120887113387
<SOS> `` your name ? '' <EOS>	59.70864806298525
<SOS> `` edmond dantès . '' <EOS>	75.3415870204503
<SOS> `` your profession ? '' <EOS>	51.616195517565345
<SOS> `` a sailor . '' <EOS>	84.60000925582358
<SOS> `` how long have you been here ? '' <EOS>	87.15454347751744
<SOS> `` since the < num > th of february , < num > . '' <EOS>	78.03591741868712
<SOS> `` your crime ? '' <EOS>	63.10366766880431
<SOS> `` i am innocent . '' <EOS>	117.62303947065321
<SOS> `` but of what are you accused ? '' <EOS>	75.71043610642334
<SOS> `` of having conspired to aid the emperor 's return . '' <EOS>	47.826644650259986
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	84.46068075556158
<SOS> for the emperor 's return ? <EOS>	73.72146648134691
<SOS> the emperor is no longer on the throne , then ? '' <EOS>	113.65969579039826
<SOS> `` he abdicated at fontainebleau in < num > , and was sent to the island of elba . <EOS>	95.34067701929246
<SOS> but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this ? '' <EOS>	69.80122679426493
<SOS> `` since < num > . '' <EOS>	44.964701567565555
<SOS> dantès shuddered ; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison . <EOS>	73.01240546265464
<SOS> `` do not dig any more , '' said the voice ; `` only tell me how high up is your excavation ? '' <EOS>	65.43489541185308
<SOS> `` on a level with the floor . '' <EOS>	77.99234578514056
<SOS> `` how is it concealed ? '' <EOS>	61.952238401950595
<SOS> `` behind my bed . '' <EOS>	57.84535228384534
<SOS> `` has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner ? '' <EOS>	78.83638853301838
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	99.91047688214293
<SOS> `` what does your chamber open on ? '' <EOS>	75.50785875520046
<SOS> `` a corridor . '' <EOS>	49.2591305406995
<SOS> `` and the corridor ? '' <EOS>	46.614101334167366
<SOS> `` on a court . '' <EOS>	47.49022973993875
<SOS> `` alas ! '' <EOS>	106.73093240382443
<SOS> murmured the voice . <EOS>	66.11771689948738
<SOS> `` oh , what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	49.427128189215914
<SOS> cried dantès . <EOS>	60.44244245007124
<SOS> `` i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans . <EOS>	65.46521307414781
<SOS> i took the wrong angle , and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended . <EOS>	51.74104699747549
<SOS> i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress . '' <EOS>	47.14919535833476
<SOS> `` but then you would be close to the sea ? '' <EOS>	93.93346837370596
<SOS> `` that is what i hoped . '' <EOS>	60.55007321122817
<SOS> `` and supposing you had succeeded ? '' <EOS>	63.78796953157449
<SOS> `` i should have thrown myself into the sea , gained one of the islands near here the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulen and then i should have been safe . '' <EOS>	40.81903210165783
<SOS> `` could you have swum so far ? '' <EOS>	88.15889120410735
<SOS> `` heaven would have given me strength ; but now all is lost . '' <EOS>	100.74010895950767
<SOS> `` all ? '' <EOS>	80.01895348470649
<SOS> `` yes ; stop up your excavation carefully , do not work any more , and wait until you hear from me . '' <EOS>	75.27401933831064
<SOS> `` tell me , at least , who you are ? '' <EOS>	89.15006094733398
<SOS> `` i am i am no . <EOS>	71.17556157072049
<SOS> < num > . '' <EOS>	100.34669960405996
<SOS> `` you mistrust me , then , '' said dantès . <EOS>	61.12728334647393
<SOS> edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths . <EOS>	74.09416264801445
<SOS> `` oh , i am a christian , '' cried dantès , guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him . <EOS>	110.98006271903608
<SOS> `` i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers ; but i conjure you do not abandon me . <EOS>	114.03783113312303
<SOS> if you do , i swear to you , for i have got to the end of my strength , that i will dash my brains out against the wall , and you will have my death to reproach yourself with . '' <EOS>	60.73541542886242
<SOS> `` how old are you ? <EOS>	70.94005133914833
<SOS> your voice is that of a young man . '' <EOS>	49.95883306204638
<SOS> `` i do not know my age , for i have not counted the years i have been here . <EOS>	75.51103458489372
<SOS> all i do know is , that i was just nineteen when i was arrested , the < num > th of february , < num > . '' <EOS>	68.43728425484979
<SOS> `` not quite twenty six ! '' <EOS>	70.84832353832107
<SOS> murmured the voice ; `` at that age he can not be a traitor . '' <EOS>	56.64843812376796
<SOS> `` oh , no , no , '' cried dantès . <EOS>	78.94509981745163
<SOS> `` i swear to you again , rather than betray you , i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces ! '' <EOS>	77.99230795515517
<SOS> `` you have done well to speak to me , and ask for my assistance , for i was about to form another plan , and leave you ; but your age reassures me . <EOS>	58.905429668960224
<SOS> i will not forget you . <EOS>	81.4092257022444
<SOS> wait . '' <EOS>	51.24435285578318
<SOS> `` how long ? '' <EOS>	77.30296553726797
<SOS> `` i must calculate our chances ; i will give you the signal . '' <EOS>	99.8753485858528
<SOS> `` but you will not leave me ; you will come to me , or you will let me come to you . <EOS>	61.720062357310944
<SOS> we will escape , and if we can not escape we will talk ; you of those whom you love , and i of those whom i love . <EOS>	77.43469122634735
<SOS> you must love somebody ? '' <EOS>	120.15292559003119
<SOS> `` no , i am alone in the world . '' <EOS>	84.45233387816373
<SOS> `` then you will love me . <EOS>	58.393775309143734
<SOS> if you are young , i will be your comrade ; if you are old , i will be your son . <EOS>	77.66585265382243
<SOS> i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives ; i only love him and a young girl called mercédès . <EOS>	96.06992810361153
<SOS> my father has not yet forgotten me , i am sure , but god alone knows if she loves me still ; i shall love you as i loved my father . '' <EOS>	80.55652901459389
<SOS> `` it is well , '' returned the voice ; `` tomorrow . '' <EOS>	92.04011399951465
<SOS> these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity ; dantès rose , dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before , and pushed his bed back against the wall . <EOS>	70.60796172243249
<SOS> he then gave himself up to his happiness . <EOS>	78.97740802519391
<SOS> he would no longer be alone . <EOS>	88.70983420635106
<SOS> he was , perhaps , about to regain his liberty ; at the worst , he would have a companion , and captivity that is shared is but half captivity . <EOS>	103.74024477138111
<SOS> plaints made in common are almost prayers , and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven . <EOS>	71.53542746369452
<SOS> all day dantès walked up and down his cell . <EOS>	71.06779608754108
<SOS> he sat down occasionally on his bed , pressing his hand on his heart . <EOS>	51.31413490614853
<SOS> at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door . <EOS>	64.8351353585476
<SOS> once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown , whom he loved already ; and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening , he would kill him with his water jug . <EOS>	49.69771497407258
<SOS> he would be condemned to die , but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life . <EOS>	76.4656088809799
<SOS> the jailer came in the evening . <EOS>	63.171442007859945
<SOS> dantès was on his bed . <EOS>	81.67682748739591
<SOS> it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening . <EOS>	84.12214793484138
<SOS> doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes , for the jailer said , `` come , are you going mad again ? '' <EOS>	45.47696006329446
<SOS> dantès did not answer ; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him . <EOS>	73.57700464960938
<SOS> the jailer went away shaking his head . <EOS>	82.82145275378464
<SOS> night came ; dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him , but he was mistaken . <EOS>	70.6866492315098
<SOS> the next morning , however , just as he removed his bed from the wall , he heard three knocks ; he threw himself on his knees . <EOS>	64.6814837299647
<SOS> `` is it you ? '' <EOS>	68.6186227233986
<SOS> said he ; `` i am here . '' <EOS>	109.4460390755215
<SOS> `` is your jailer gone ? '' <EOS>	66.21385940825853
<SOS> `` yes , '' said dantès ; `` he will not return until the evening ; so that we have twelve hours before us . '' <EOS>	63.73823626844525
<SOS> `` i can work , then ? '' <EOS>	67.4951231737082
<SOS> said the voice . <EOS>	72.60314232871644
<SOS> `` oh , yes , yes ; this instant , i entreat you . '' <EOS>	87.14567684255931
<SOS> in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands , as he knelt with his head in the opening , suddenly gave way ; he drew back smartly , while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed . <EOS>	94.03483525912995
<SOS> then from the bottom of this passage , the depth of which it was impossible to measure , he saw appear , first the head , then the shoulders , and lastly the body of a man , who sprang lightly into his cell . <EOS>	68.83350485161034
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	100.06618693471158
<SOS> a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired , dantès almost carried him towards the window , in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating . <EOS>	86.51985912292632
<SOS> he was a man of small stature , with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age . <EOS>	90.32496225415612
<SOS> he had a deep set , penetrating eye , almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow , and a long ( and still black ) beard reaching down to his breast . <EOS>	43.42793229842527
<SOS> his thin face , deeply furrowed by care , and the bold outline of his strongly marked features , betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength . <EOS>	77.79996108523224
<SOS> large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned . <EOS>	69.72400489711158
<SOS> the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years ; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time . <EOS>	62.148754259236156
<SOS> he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure , as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent . <EOS>	88.84058324069585
<SOS> he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome , although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty . <EOS>	69.2125712001432
<SOS> `` let us first see , '' said he , `` whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it . '' <EOS>	42.166449062438986
<SOS> advancing to the opening , he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight ; then , fitting it into its place , he said : `` you removed this stone very carelessly ; but i suppose you had no tools to aid you . '' <EOS>	74.1147426351645
<SOS> `` why , '' exclaimed dantès , with astonishment , `` do you possess any ? '' <EOS>	84.84517822844289
<SOS> `` i made myself some ; and with the exception of a file , i have all that are necessary , a chisel , pincers , and lever . '' <EOS>	86.35018464760637
<SOS> < num > m `` oh , how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience . '' <EOS>	50.87589463364805
<SOS> `` well , in the first place , here is my chisel . '' <EOS>	85.03358776155767
<SOS> so saying , he displayed a sharp strong blade , with a handle made of beechwood . <EOS>	78.76153556305354
<SOS> `` and with what did you contrive to make that ? '' <EOS>	86.78024466015863
<SOS> inquired dantès . <EOS>	106.59154137620781
<SOS> `` with one of the clamps of my bedstead ; and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither , a distance of about fifty feet . '' <EOS>	65.06212644583792
<SOS> `` fifty feet ! '' <EOS>	55.21033175300234
<SOS> responded dantès , almost terrified . <EOS>	72.16646839052082
<SOS> `` do not speak so loud , young man do n't speak so loud . <EOS>	72.34433439605549
<SOS> it frequently occurs in a state prison like this , that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners . '' <EOS>	97.2489848972856
<SOS> `` but they believe i am shut up alone here . '' <EOS>	75.75321697324206
<SOS> `` that makes no difference . '' <EOS>	55.400385049523145
<SOS> `` and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here ? '' <EOS>	50.54860215833071
<SOS> `` i do ; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine ; only , unfortunately , i did not curve aright ; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion , instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet , i made it fifty . <EOS>	95.53785122154812
<SOS> i expected , as i told you , to reach the outer wall , pierce through it , and throw myself into the sea ; i have , however , kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens , instead of going beneath it . <EOS>	92.685366997068
<SOS> my labor is all in vain , for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers . '' <EOS>	73.69099069803727
<SOS> `` that 's true , '' said dantès ; `` but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell ; there are three others do you know anything of their situation ? '' <EOS>	71.61462896631473
<SOS> `` this one is built against the solid rock , and it would take ten experienced miners , duly furnished with the requisite tools , as many years to perforate it . <EOS>	52.382783448230924
<SOS> this adjoins the lower part of the governor 's apartments , and were we to work our way through , we should only get into some lock up cellars , where we must necessarily be recaptured . <EOS>	63.351005180109894
<SOS> the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute , now where does it face ? '' <EOS>	83.74691711055948
<SOS> the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber . <EOS>	57.316751424448555
<SOS> this loophole , which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside , to an opening through which a child could not have passed , was , for better security , furnished with three iron bars , so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner 's escape . <EOS>	54.83999330782372
<SOS> as the stranger asked the question , he dragged the table beneath the window . <EOS>	76.02870985802114
<SOS> `` climb up , '' said he to dantès . <EOS>	54.392485038099835
<SOS> the young man obeyed , mounted on the table , and , divining the wishes of his companion , placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands . <EOS>	79.36736290854392
<SOS> the stranger , whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom . <EOS>	80.44405539639335
<SOS> an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , `` i thought so ! '' <EOS>	89.52177406792684
<SOS> and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground . <EOS>	104.84899264445745
<SOS> `` what was it that you thought ? '' <EOS>	86.25209284787013
<SOS> asked the young man anxiously , in his turn descending from the table . <EOS>	118.8842040939221
<SOS> the elder prisoner pondered the matter . <EOS>	106.75020711772936
<SOS> `` yes , '' said he at length , `` it is so . <EOS>	101.64384706630659
<SOS> this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery , where patrols are continually passing , and sentries keep watch day and night . '' <EOS>	69.81125324349787
<SOS> `` are you quite sure of that ? '' <EOS>	70.26043714442373
<SOS> `` certain . <EOS>	78.4392599102676
<SOS> i saw the soldier 's shape and the top of his musket ; that made me draw in my head so quickly , for i was fearful he might also see me . '' <EOS>	72.41569072735082
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	70.04520415224749
<SOS> inquired dantès . <EOS>	72.30981741619513
<SOS> `` you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon ? '' <EOS>	52.93637124913932
<SOS> `` then `` pursued the young man eagerly . <EOS>	59.52403018391392
<SOS> `` then , '' answered the elder prisoner , `` the will of god be done ! '' <EOS>	95.58845757417731
<SOS> and as the old man slowly pronounced those words , an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance . <EOS>	83.02577645176139
<SOS> dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration . <EOS>	65.36978958581523
<SOS> `` tell me , i entreat of you , who and what you are ? '' <EOS>	108.68145440728209
<SOS> said he at length . <EOS>	62.90868449413833
<SOS> `` never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself . '' <EOS>	90.72688577312726
<SOS> `` willingly , '' answered the stranger ; `` if , indeed , you feel any curiosity respecting one , now , alas , powerless to aid you in any way . '' <EOS>	74.90170694750194
<SOS> `` say not so ; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind . <EOS>	66.5991338536009
<SOS> pray let me know who you really are ? '' <EOS>	75.2269746449322
<SOS> the stranger smiled a melancholy smile . <EOS>	66.39392823013804
<SOS> `` then listen , '' said he . <EOS>	65.60101287006073
<SOS> `` i am the abbé faria , and have been imprisoned as you know in this château d'if since the year < num > ; previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle . <EOS>	67.9134522815726
<SOS> in the year < num > i was transferred to piedmont in france . <EOS>	64.15378349189659
<SOS> it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon , had bestowed on him a son , named king of rome even in his cradle . <EOS>	64.14910640579393
<SOS> i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of ; namely , that four years afterwards , this colossus of power would be overthrown . <EOS>	55.044888998128926
<SOS> then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii. ? '' <EOS>	72.09316637998887
<SOS> `` no , louis xviii . '' <EOS>	54.703601227213845
<SOS> `` the brother of louis xvi . ! <EOS>	50.29727227619517
<SOS> how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated , and raise up him who was so abased ? '' <EOS>	80.23250740490485
<SOS> dantès ' whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others . <EOS>	71.90544361206587
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' continued he , `` 'twill be the same as it was in england . <EOS>	69.38238820447023
<SOS> after charles i. , cromwell ; after cromwell , charles ii. , and then james ii. , and then some son in law or relation , some prince of orange , a stadtholder who becomes a king . <EOS>	57.29973620443079
<SOS> then new concessions to the people , then a constitution , then liberty . <EOS>	71.9440016071178
<SOS> ah , my friend ! '' <EOS>	77.3633436093804
<SOS> said the abbé , turning towards dantès , and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet , `` you are young , you will see all this come to pass . '' <EOS>	63.67821626533895
<SOS> `` probably , if ever i get out of prison ! '' <EOS>	63.828319563850606
<SOS> `` true , '' replied faria , `` we are prisoners ; but i forget this sometimes , and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls , and i fancy myself at liberty . '' <EOS>	71.77236195812367
<SOS> `` but wherefore are you here ? '' <EOS>	91.6665258901789
<SOS> `` because in < num > i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in < num > ; because , like machiavelli , i desired to alter the political face of italy , and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities , each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler , i sought to form one large , compact , and powerful empire ; and , lastly , because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton , who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me . <EOS>	88.22223108170792
<SOS> it was the plan of alexander vi . <EOS>	67.43930011858477
<SOS> and clement vii. , but it will never succeed now , for they attempted it fruitlessly , and napoleon was unable to complete his work . <EOS>	76.2967795155227
<SOS> italy seems fated to misfortune . '' <EOS>	45.66375672090461
<SOS> and the old man bowed his head . <EOS>	94.38817438761322
<SOS> dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters . <EOS>	45.03144790700613
<SOS> napoleon certainly he knew something of , inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him ; but of clement vii . <EOS>	87.84828093949675
<SOS> and alexander vi . <EOS>	106.51429557588713
<SOS> he knew nothing . <EOS>	53.44836597094507
<SOS> `` are you not , '' he asked , `` the priest who here in the château d'if is generally thought to be ill ? '' <EOS>	106.91517884412737
<SOS> `` mad , you mean , do n't you ? '' <EOS>	83.34827762459066
<SOS> `` i did not like to say so , '' answered dantès , smiling . <EOS>	76.44811385770909
<SOS> `` well , then , '' resumed faria with a bitter smile , `` let me answer your question in full , by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d'if , for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity ; and , in all probability , i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children , if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair . '' <EOS>	48.676059270048285
<SOS> dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless ; at length he said : `` then you abandon all hope of escape ? '' <EOS>	70.0932582894862
<SOS> `` i perceive its utter impossibility ; and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve . '' <EOS>	61.721292431137414
<SOS> `` nay , be not discouraged . <EOS>	82.84848672424096
<SOS> would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt ? <EOS>	59.173262153874056
<SOS> why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed ? '' <EOS>	73.42260062964024
<SOS> `` alas , it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated , that you talk of beginning over again . <EOS>	76.08476059452127
<SOS> in the first place , i was four years making the tools i possess , and have been two years scraping and digging out earth , hard as granite itself ; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen . <EOS>	74.73756271220606
<SOS> whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts , considering my labor well repaid if , by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement , changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves ; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up , i was compelled to break through a staircase , and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it ; but the well is now so completely choked up , that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery . <EOS>	86.5464975524921
<SOS> consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking , for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise ; and now , at the moment when i reckoned upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me . <EOS>	54.20524274126321
<SOS> no , i repeat again , that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty 's pleasure . '' <EOS>	57.777456116293465
<SOS> dantès held down his head , that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé 's plans . <EOS>	75.8864492963256
<SOS> the abbé sank upon edmond 's bed , while edmond himself remained standing . <EOS>	49.818619299875614
<SOS> escape had never once occurred to him . <EOS>	79.69202937467416
<SOS> there are , indeed , some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant . <EOS>	65.37414172849884
<SOS> to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which , if successful , would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty , sixty , perhaps a hundred feet , at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks , should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels ; and even , supposing all these perils past , then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme , resigning himself rather to death . <EOS>	106.38897414066004
<SOS> but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage , gave a fresh turn to his ideas , and inspired him with new courage . <EOS>	69.69155990958929
<SOS> another , older and less strong than he , had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake , and had failed only because of an error in calculation . <EOS>	68.89910274156473
<SOS> this same person , with almost incredible patience and perseverance , had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt . <EOS>	44.358936105828654
<SOS> another had done all this ; why , then , was it impossible to dantès ? <EOS>	78.95173785528821
<SOS> faria had dug his way through fifty feet , dantès would dig a hundred ; faria , at the age of fifty , had devoted three years to the task ; he , who was but half as old , would sacrifice six ; faria , a priest and savant , had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume , rattonneau , or lemaire ; should a hardy sailor , an experienced diver , like himself , shrink from a similar task ; should he , who had so often for mere amusement 's sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch , hesitate to entertain the same project ? <EOS>	92.53463692866842
<SOS> he could do it in an hour , and how many times had he , for pure pastime , continued in the water for more than twice as long ! <EOS>	75.50841225129254
<SOS> at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion , and to remember that what has once been done may be done again . <EOS>	53.86973835223371
<SOS> after continuing some time in profound meditation , the young man suddenly exclaimed , `` i have found what you were in search of ! '' <EOS>	79.89072020727377
<SOS> faria started : `` have you , indeed ? '' <EOS>	92.18909659842294
<SOS> cried he , raising his head with quick anxiety ; `` pray , let me know what it is you have discovered ? '' <EOS>	89.21339028740381
<SOS> `` the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here , extends in the same direction as the outer gallery , does it not ? '' <EOS>	75.6373975479898
<SOS> < num > m `` it does . '' <EOS>	94.42111578623793
<SOS> `` and is not above fifteen feet from it ? '' <EOS>	67.54233124532423
<SOS> `` about that . '' <EOS>	61.07431248795137
<SOS> `` well , then , i will tell you what we must do . <EOS>	70.71980993655498
<SOS> we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle , as it were the top part of a cross . <EOS>	98.4395508982766
<SOS> this time you will lay your plans more accurately ; we shall get out into the gallery you have described ; kill the sentinel who guards it , and make our escape . <EOS>	52.641865745362814
<SOS> all we require to insure success is courage , and that you possess , and strength , which i am not deficient in ; as for patience , you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine . '' <EOS>	87.49696621872339
<SOS> `` one instant , my dear friend , '' replied the abbé ; `` it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed , and what use i intend making of my strength . <EOS>	60.981793279359465
<SOS> as for patience , i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before , and every night renewing the task of the day . <EOS>	49.07456059328923
<SOS> but then , young man ( and i pray of you to give me your full attention ) , then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence , and merited not condemnation . '' <EOS>	77.90303833150156
<SOS> `` and have your notions changed ? '' <EOS>	54.97590178935106
<SOS> asked dantès with much surprise ; `` do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me ? '' <EOS>	75.64682034041748
<SOS> `` no ; neither do i wish to incur guilt . <EOS>	68.67141827878172
<SOS> hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances , not men . <EOS>	67.36757548936971
<SOS> i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall , or destroy a staircase ; but i can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life . '' <EOS>	74.14790686127078
<SOS> a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès . <EOS>	71.69310714531316
<SOS> `` is it possible , '' said he , `` that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it ? '' <EOS>	83.56481948402391
<SOS> `` tell me , '' replied faria , `` what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead , dressing yourself in his clothes , and endeavoring to escape ? '' <EOS>	75.70931684814838
<SOS> `` simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me , '' answered dantès . <EOS>	70.1417164136524
<SOS> `` because , '' said the old man , `` the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it ; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty . <EOS>	48.70767652653466
<SOS> the tiger , whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood , needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach , and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim ; but man , on the contrary , loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life ; his natural construction and physiological formation `` dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind , or rather soul ; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas , those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart . <EOS>	93.2594389291008
<SOS> < num > m `` since my imprisonment , '' said faria , `` i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record . <EOS>	54.385019451939286
<SOS> they have rarely been successful . <EOS>	89.14887985640773
<SOS> those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon , and carefully arranged ; such , for instance , as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes , that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l'evêque ; of latude from the bastille . <EOS>	93.57281720630125
<SOS> then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity , and those are the best of all . <EOS>	87.86868421758493
<SOS> let us , therefore , wait patiently for some favorable moment , and when it presents itself , profit by it . '' <EOS>	80.9206845133899
<SOS> `` ah , '' said dantès , `` you might well endure the tedious delay ; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself , and when weary with toil , you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you . '' <EOS>	77.30576933904254
<SOS> `` i assure you , '' replied the old man , `` i did not turn to that source for recreation or support . '' <EOS>	56.72140241443846
<SOS> `` what did you do then ? '' <EOS>	45.89521032502285
<SOS> `` i wrote or studied . '' <EOS>	82.58501207354264
<SOS> `` were you then permitted the use of pens , ink , and paper ? '' <EOS>	54.31636856970851
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' answered the abbé ; `` i had none but what i made for myself . '' <EOS>	68.07394801414429
<SOS> `` you made paper , pens and ink ? '' <EOS>	98.20377641207939
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	80.90932225801825
<SOS> dantès gazed with admiration , but he had some difficulty in believing . <EOS>	87.86354985108444
<SOS> faria saw this . <EOS>	108.76124791940666
<SOS> `` when you pay me a visit in my cell , my young friend , '' said he , `` i will show you an entire work , the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life ; many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome , at the foot of st. mark 's column at venice , and on the borders of the arno at florence , little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d'if . <EOS>	62.62327262224919
<SOS> the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy , and will make one large quarto volume . '' <EOS>	51.19670678213328
<SOS> `` and on what have you written all this ? '' <EOS>	113.27889326532183
<SOS> `` on two of my shirts . <EOS>	51.427109282712465
<SOS> i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment . '' <EOS>	44.06346521483121
<SOS> `` you are , then , a chemist ? '' <EOS>	72.99032298583013
<SOS> `` somewhat ; i know lavoisier , and was the intimate friend of cabanis . '' <EOS>	58.81915678803339
<SOS> `` but for such a work you must have needed books had you any ? '' <EOS>	53.10074444934984
<SOS> `` i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome ; but after reading them over many times , i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses , if not a complete summary of all human knowledge , at least all that a man need really know . <EOS>	68.37746605618936
<SOS> i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes , till i knew them nearly by heart ; so that since i have been in prison , a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me . <EOS>	91.63051810661146
<SOS> i could recite you the whole of thucydides , xenophon , plutarch , titus livius , tacitus , strada , jornandes , dante , montaigne , shakespeare , spinoza , machiavelli , and bossuet . <EOS>	107.32066724556317
<SOS> i name only the most important . '' <EOS>	77.35600931701117
<SOS> `` you are , doubtless , acquainted with a variety of languages , so as to have been able to read all these ? '' <EOS>	69.27848991415357
<SOS> `` yes , i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say , german , french , italian , english , and spanish ; by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i do n't speak it so well as i could wish , but i am still trying to improve myself . '' <EOS>	93.64014026225769
<SOS> `` improve yourself ! '' <EOS>	64.51720659182129
<SOS> repeated dantès ; `` why , how can you manage to do so ? '' <EOS>	71.73093112423719
<SOS> `` why , i made a vocabulary of the words i knew ; turned , returned , and arranged them , so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium . <EOS>	63.19767761728181
<SOS> i know nearly one thousand words , which is all that is absolutely necessary , although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries . <EOS>	96.74328786226138
<SOS> i can not hope to be very fluent , but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes ; and that would be quite as much as i should ever require . '' <EOS>	107.18104317138376
<SOS> stronger grew the wonder of dantès , who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers ; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings , he added , `` then if you were not furnished with pens , how did you manage to write the work you speak of ? '' <EOS>	73.52794487135635
<SOS> `` i made myself some excellent ones , which would be universally preferred to all others if once known . <EOS>	94.4885182776553
<SOS> you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days . <EOS>	51.0762182196304
<SOS> well , i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes , and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday , friday , and saturday , as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens ; for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief . <EOS>	71.46351975557084
<SOS> while retracing the past , i forget the present ; and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner . '' <EOS>	70.9941594436271
<SOS> `` but the ink , '' said dantès ; `` of what did you make your ink ? '' <EOS>	81.26016445903934
<SOS> `` there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon , '' replied faria , `` but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison . <EOS>	67.78366210202779
<SOS> still , it must have been many years in use , for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot ; this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday , and i assure you a better ink can not be desired . <EOS>	44.46339000083658
<SOS> for very important notes , for which closer attention is required , i pricked one of my fingers , and wrote with my own blood . '' <EOS>	67.85848075971249
<SOS> `` and when , '' asked dantès , `` may i see all this ? '' <EOS>	90.41269294995065
<SOS> `` whenever you please , '' replied the abbé . <EOS>	91.14842046342176
<SOS> `` oh , then let it be directly ! '' <EOS>	86.53486361299036
<SOS> exclaimed the young man . <EOS>	79.1335243912651
<SOS> `` follow me , then , '' said the abbé , as he re entered the subterranean passage , in which he soon disappeared , followed by dantès . <EOS>	91.56091572071635
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	79.94814795895397
<SOS> the abbé 's chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage , which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor , into which the abbé 's cell opened ; from that point the passage became much narrower , and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees . <EOS>	71.4553106166414
<SOS> the floor of the abbé 's cell was paved , and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion . <EOS>	86.6715827947558
<SOS> as he entered the chamber of his friend , dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels , but nothing more than common met his view . <EOS>	55.067940010017104
<SOS> `` it is well , '' said the abbé ; `` we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o'clock . '' <EOS>	75.67093640850146
<SOS> instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour . <EOS>	95.38436932997328
<SOS> `` look at this ray of light which enters by my window , '' said the abbé , `` and then observe the lines traced on the wall . <EOS>	80.3608065450316
<SOS> well , by means of these lines , which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth , and the ellipse it describes round the sun , i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch ; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements , while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths . '' <EOS>	78.1432952700497
<SOS> this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès , who had always imagined , from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean , that it moved , and not the earth . <EOS>	58.44031162963412
<SOS> a double movement of the globe he inhabited , and of which he could feel nothing , appeared to him perfectly impossible . <EOS>	56.86505715066113
<SOS> each word that fell from his companion 's lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science , as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda , which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth . <EOS>	73.18662822570661
<SOS> `` come , '' said he to the abbé , `` i am anxious to see your treasures . '' <EOS>	71.95603964088652
<SOS> the abbé smiled , and , proceeding to the disused fireplace , raised , by the help of his chisel , a long stone , which had doubtless been the hearth , beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth , serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès . <EOS>	88.26498652724982
<SOS> < num > m `` what do you wish to see first ? '' <EOS>	73.84121446700445
<SOS> asked the abbé . <EOS>	99.2146421642872
<SOS> `` oh , your great work on the monarchy of italy ! '' <EOS>	81.83121391587885
<SOS> faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen , laid one over the other , like folds of papyrus . <EOS>	66.52484857649473
<SOS> these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long ; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing , so legible that dantès could easily read it , as well as make out the sense it being in italian , a language he , as a provençal , perfectly understood . <EOS>	74.10761914380211
<SOS> `` there , '' said he , `` there is the work complete . <EOS>	47.69295746389126
<SOS> i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago . <EOS>	101.41030584948335
<SOS> i have torn up two of my shirts , and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of , to complete the precious pages . <EOS>	66.97423291061097
<SOS> should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed , my literary reputation is forever secured . '' <EOS>	61.73763803820451
<SOS> `` i see , '' answered dantès . <EOS>	65.7757123841727
<SOS> `` now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work . '' <EOS>	73.53381050571721
<SOS> `` look ! '' <EOS>	113.10574435023707
<SOS> said faria , showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long , and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush , to the end of which was tied , by a piece of thread , one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès ; it was pointed , and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen . <EOS>	46.132545917331726
<SOS> dantès examined it with intense admiration , then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form . <EOS>	66.18809478495474
<SOS> `` ah , yes , '' said faria ; `` the penknife . <EOS>	50.55802552245175
<SOS> that 's my masterpiece . <EOS>	83.5326687517506
<SOS> i made it , as well as this larger knife , out of an old iron candlestick . '' <EOS>	63.13876323446371
<SOS> the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor ; as for the other knife , it would serve a double purpose , and with it one could cut and thrust . <EOS>	91.88535961794383
<SOS> dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels . <EOS>	85.34611831753753
<SOS> `` as for the ink , '' said faria , `` i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time , as i require it . '' <EOS>	88.70008311097337
<SOS> `` one thing still puzzles me , '' observed dantès , `` and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight ? '' <EOS>	50.94744627360614
<SOS> `` i worked at night also , '' replied faria . <EOS>	52.133257583520994
<SOS> `` night ! <EOS>	85.56721072049486
<SOS> why , for heaven 's sake , are your eyes like cats ' , that you can see to work in the dark ? '' <EOS>	54.96491501432686
<SOS> `` indeed they are not ; but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions . <EOS>	60.91171966210189
<SOS> i furnished myself with a light . '' <EOS>	85.80042508768885
<SOS> `` you did ? <EOS>	95.82218411586935
<SOS> pray tell me how . '' <EOS>	73.61978191708283
<SOS> `` i separated the fat from the meat served to me , melted it , and so made oil here is my lamp . '' <EOS>	62.894342275589175
<SOS> so saying , the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations . <EOS>	57.11046601967853
<SOS> `` but how do you procure a light ? '' <EOS>	75.8824802128486
<SOS> `` oh , here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen . '' <EOS>	77.7747342037177
<SOS> `` and matches ? '' <EOS>	94.46288082948043
<SOS> `` i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin , and asked for a little sulphur , which was readily supplied . '' <EOS>	56.52633811493291
<SOS> dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table , and stood with his head drooping on his breast , as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria 's mind . <EOS>	48.6514524873119
<SOS> < num > m `` you have not seen all yet , '' continued faria , `` for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place . <EOS>	52.381232519562865
<SOS> let us shut this one up . '' <EOS>	81.82898952545095
<SOS> they put the stone back in its place ; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed , rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other , and then , going towards his bed , he removed it from the spot it stood in . <EOS>	82.10627682709976
<SOS> behind the head of the bed , and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion , was a hollow space , and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length . <EOS>	73.6049565084348
<SOS> dantès closely and eagerly examined it ; he found it firm , solid , and compact enough to bear any weight . <EOS>	76.28130065132673
<SOS> `` who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work ? '' <EOS>	90.81584082322725
<SOS> `` i tore up several of my shirts , and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed , during my three years ' imprisonment at fenestrelle ; and when i was removed to the château d'if , i managed to bring the ravellings with me , so that i have been able to finish my work here . '' <EOS>	55.003179067579715
<SOS> `` and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed ? '' <EOS>	54.843583450982464
<SOS> `` oh , no , for when i had taken out the thread i required , i hemmed the edges over again . '' <EOS>	89.61131263142586
<SOS> `` with what ? '' <EOS>	64.39299411961791
<SOS> `` with this needle , '' said the abbé , as , opening his ragged vestments , he showed dantès a long , sharp fish bone , with a small perforated eye for the thread , a small portion of which still remained in it . <EOS>	44.564945845606935
<SOS> `` i once thought , '' continued faria , `` of removing these iron bars , and letting myself down from the window , which , as you see , is somewhat wider than yours , although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight ; however , i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court , and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger . <EOS>	82.5976604371513
<SOS> nevertheless , i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now , and which sudden chance frequently brings about . '' <EOS>	75.86774803088578
<SOS> while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder , the mind of dantès was , in fact , busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent , ingenious , and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes , where he himself could see nothing . <EOS>	55.99165367335921
<SOS> `` what are you thinking of ? '' <EOS>	58.51347231891505
<SOS> asked the abbé smilingly , imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder . <EOS>	61.97584360025917
<SOS> `` i was reflecting , in the first place , '' replied dantès , `` upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained . <EOS>	106.13558028358742
<SOS> what would you not have accomplished if you had been free ? '' <EOS>	64.20371513928929
<SOS> `` possibly nothing at all ; the overflow of my brain would probably , in a state of freedom , have evaporated in a thousand follies ; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect . <EOS>	98.94437749232404
<SOS> compression is needed to explode gunpowder . <EOS>	79.28488312340006
<SOS> captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus ; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity , lightning , from lightning , illumination . '' <EOS>	61.85491585590067
<SOS> `` no , '' replied dantès . <EOS>	64.46033505265113
<SOS> `` i know nothing . <EOS>	83.13018969928903
<SOS> some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning . <EOS>	57.36232683173553
<SOS> you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have . '' <EOS>	66.6332901745554
<SOS> the abbé smiled . <EOS>	85.50070233119912
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , `` but you had another subject for your thoughts ; did you not say so just now ? '' <EOS>	92.15551236208898
<SOS> `` i did ! '' <EOS>	43.9688257249918
<SOS> `` you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other . '' <EOS>	46.90228985241004
<SOS> `` it was this , that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life , you were perfectly unacquainted with mine . '' <EOS>	80.44259918186943
<SOS> `` your life , my young friend , has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events . '' <EOS>	72.38463784614564
<SOS> `` it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune . <EOS>	92.82091477365248
<SOS> i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven . '' <EOS>	97.69863807288338
<SOS> `` then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged ? '' <EOS>	50.99964670366024
<SOS> `` i do , indeed ; and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth , my father and mercédès . '' <EOS>	50.10148816978694
<SOS> `` come , '' said the abbé , closing his hiding place , and pushing the bed back to its original situation , `` let me hear your story . '' <EOS>	48.57649558799178
<SOS> dantès obeyed , and commenced what he called his history , but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india , and two or three voyages to the levant , until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise , with the death of captain leclere , and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal ; his interview with that personage , and his receiving , in place of the packet brought , a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles , and interview with his father his affection for mercédès , and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination , his temporary detention at the palais de justice , and his final imprisonment in the château d'if . <EOS>	51.33905531037615
<SOS> from this point everything was a blank to dantès he knew nothing more , not even the length of time he had been imprisoned . <EOS>	62.23368668368411
<SOS> his recital finished , the abbé reflected long and earnestly . <EOS>	110.75651497865124
<SOS> `` there is , '' said he , at the end of his meditations , `` a clever maxim , which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago , and that is , that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind , human nature , in a right and wholesome state , revolts at crime . <EOS>	98.24816897549685
<SOS> still , from an artificial civilization have originated wants , vices , and false tastes , which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings , and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness . <EOS>	74.17017605432831
<SOS> from this view of things , then , comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action , seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous . <EOS>	59.2374672665586
<SOS> now , to apply it in your case , to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable ? '' <EOS>	88.31612609752531
<SOS> `` to no one , by heaven ! <EOS>	64.91679463446587
<SOS> i was a very insignificant person . '' <EOS>	70.84984762908553
<SOS> `` do not speak thus , for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy ; everything is relative , my dear young friend , from the king who stands in the way of his successor , to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place . <EOS>	111.65962135543379
<SOS> now , in the event of the king 's death , his successor inherits a crown , when the employee dies , the supernumerary steps into his shoes , and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres . <EOS>	92.44588317303193
<SOS> well , these twelve thousand livres are his civil list , and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king . <EOS>	58.67619327635538
<SOS> everyone , from the highest to the lowest degree , has his place on the social ladder , and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests , as in descartes ' theory of pressure and impulsion . <EOS>	43.705570727438804
<SOS> but these forces increase as we go higher , so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base . <EOS>	90.09298638639737

<SOS> i had quarelled with him some time previously , and had even challenged him to fight me ; but he refused . '' <EOS>	83.394399501661
<SOS> `` now we are getting on . <EOS>	42.04433417935415
<SOS> and what was this man 's name ? '' <EOS>	55.24282632021044
<SOS> `` danglars . '' <EOS>	63.82298912279942
<SOS> `` what rank did he hold on board ? '' <EOS>	75.34013116902938
<SOS> `` he was supercargo . '' <EOS>	64.52483972052875
<SOS> `` and had you been captain , should you have retained him in his employment ? '' <EOS>	68.65167991054965
<SOS> `` not if the choice had remained with me , for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts . '' <EOS>	86.90657979413365
<SOS> `` good again ! <EOS>	92.24658938079615
<SOS> now then , tell me , was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere ? '' <EOS>	89.44372472489052
<SOS> `` no ; we were quite alone . '' <EOS>	70.18807478603797
<SOS> `` could your conversation have been overheard by anyone ? '' <EOS>	96.19395762448659
<SOS> `` it might , for the cabin door was open and stay ; now i recollect , danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal . '' <EOS>	96.1964032531102
<SOS> `` that 's better , '' cried the abbé ; `` now we are on the right scent . <EOS>	59.01701954475202

<SOS> `` nobody . '' <EOS>	57.416552790081134
<SOS> `` somebody there received your packet , and gave you a letter in place of it , i think ? '' <EOS>	56.897241752984755
<SOS> `` yes ; the grand marshal did . '' <EOS>	105.729419309425
<SOS> `` and what did you do with that letter ? '' <EOS>	93.56438992527241
<SOS> `` put it into my portfolio . '' <EOS>	83.17848801901914
<SOS> `` you had your portfolio with you , then ? <EOS>	93.32012091986458
<SOS> now , how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter ? '' <EOS>	79.98828986270284
<SOS> `` you are right ; it was left on board . '' <EOS>	91.27800568944079
<SOS> `` then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio ? '' <EOS>	48.86278823287027
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	53.83567683435112
<SOS> `` and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel ? '' <EOS>	65.32610278713854
<SOS> `` i carried it in my hand . '' <EOS>	106.62389203005716
<SOS> `` so that when you went on board the pharaon , everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand ? '' <EOS>	63.244592082003955
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	77.99053285480272
<SOS> `` danglars , as well as the rest ? '' <EOS>	103.85955461922245
<SOS> `` danglars , as well as others . '' <EOS>	53.752813954853764
<SOS> `` now , listen to me , and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest . <EOS>	55.66962667413669
<SOS> do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated ? '' <EOS>	69.34873486109936
<SOS> `` oh yes , i read it over three times , and the words sank deeply into my memory . '' <EOS>	77.12714784458423
<SOS> `` repeat it to me . '' <EOS>	74.16408353440764
<SOS> dantès paused a moment , then said , `` this is it , word for word : 'the king 's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion , that one edmond dantès , mate on board the pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper ; again , by the usurper , with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris . <EOS>	75.69624945565971
<SOS> this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest , as the letter will be found either about his person , at his father 's residence , or in his cabin on board the pharaon . ' '' <EOS>	78.79661998900309
<SOS> the abbé shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	65.0395209746299
<SOS> `` the thing is clear as day , '' said he ; `` and you must have had a very confiding nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair . '' <EOS>	102.08497006260393
<SOS> `` do you really think so ? <EOS>	55.437354873353165
<SOS> ah , that would indeed be infamous . '' <EOS>	66.03379929887255
<SOS> `` how did danglars usually write ? '' <EOS>	87.60919161598345
<SOS> `` in a handsome , running hand . '' <EOS>	106.96531470964585
<SOS> `` and how was the anonymous letter written ? '' <EOS>	114.2761997157405
<SOS> `` backhanded . '' <EOS>	85.45877565544909
<SOS> again the abbé smiled . <EOS>	73.02628930151712
<SOS> `` disguised . '' <EOS>	87.39292339513501
<SOS> `` it was very boldly written , if disguised . '' <EOS>	64.62920397332022
<SOS> `` stop a bit , '' said the abbé , taking up what he called his pen , and , after dipping it into the ink , he wrote on a piece of prepared linen , with his left hand , the first two or three words of the accusation . <EOS>	86.17476296801159
<SOS> dantès drew back , and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror . <EOS>	57.985097888060224
<SOS> `` how very astonishing ! '' <EOS>	97.14449064313342
<SOS> cried he at length . <EOS>	93.93384555388666
<SOS> `` why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation . '' <EOS>	77.5903269482889
<SOS> `` simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and i have noticed that `` `` what ? '' <EOS>	77.28444579668296
<SOS> `` that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform . '' <EOS>	53.58324962998402
<SOS> `` you have evidently seen and observed everything . '' <EOS>	80.33694725698398
<SOS> `` let us proceed . '' <EOS>	83.54802935869303
<SOS> `` oh , yes , yes ! '' <EOS>	71.12983600442851
<SOS> `` now as regards the second question . '' <EOS>	47.335489363524154
<SOS> `` i am listening . '' <EOS>	64.08728307386836
<SOS> `` was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès ? '' <EOS>	71.86401428974112
<SOS> `` yes ; a young man who loved her . '' <EOS>	52.368540327739595
<SOS> `` and his name was `` `` fernand . '' <EOS>	109.95040365820256

<SOS> `` he was a catalan . '' <EOS>	78.53336349730961
<SOS> `` you imagine him capable of writing the letter ? '' <EOS>	49.03831765044693
<SOS> `` oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me . '' <EOS>	70.00657639967666
<SOS> `` that is in strict accordance with the spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never . '' <EOS>	82.80252316520361
<SOS> `` besides , '' said dantès , `` the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him . '' <EOS>	71.12894932146068
<SOS> `` you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? '' <EOS>	61.011920173336165
<SOS> `` to no one . '' <EOS>	63.392455940022366
<SOS> `` not even to your mistress ? '' <EOS>	98.10374292183216
<SOS> `` no , not even to my betrothed . '' <EOS>	65.94034708530008
<SOS> `` then it is danglars . '' <EOS>	45.65757315542757
<SOS> `` i feel quite sure of it now . '' <EOS>	64.32984788401164
<SOS> `` wait a little . <EOS>	74.934077613311
<SOS> pray , was danglars acquainted with fernand ? '' <EOS>	77.35885202814445
<SOS> `` no yes , he was . <EOS>	66.08932060834198
<SOS> now i recollect `` `` what ? '' <EOS>	76.75805190803895
<SOS> `` to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile 's the evening before the day fixed for my wedding . <EOS>	67.04645522751387
<SOS> they were in earnest conversation . <EOS>	52.37747286933457
<SOS> danglars was joking in a friendly way , but fernand looked pale and agitated . '' <EOS>	71.8467473242386
<SOS> `` were they alone ? '' <EOS>	58.75941576374624
<SOS> `` there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well , and who had , in all probability made their acquaintance ; he was a tailor named caderousse , but he was very drunk . <EOS>	70.435552138785
<SOS> stay ! <EOS>	48.941183997839495
<SOS> stay ! <EOS>	57.56459221342344
<SOS> how strange that it should not have occurred to me before ! <EOS>	64.53155674660539
<SOS> now i remember quite well , that on the table round which they were sitting were pens , ink , and paper . <EOS>	75.19603012806337
<SOS> oh , the heartless , treacherous scoundrels ! '' <EOS>	87.49874456481666
<SOS> exclaimed dantès , pressing his hand to his throbbing brows . <EOS>	52.90486366305589
<SOS> `` is there anything else i can assist you in discovering , besides the villany of your friends ? '' <EOS>	50.410148682466144
<SOS> inquired the abbé with a laugh . <EOS>	63.56007055712403
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' replied dantès eagerly ; `` i would beg of you , who see so completely to the depths of things , and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle , to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination , was never brought to trial , and , above all , was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me ? '' <EOS>	91.86918164212871
<SOS> `` that is altogether a different and more serious matter , '' responded the abbé . <EOS>	96.51188906457529
<SOS> `` the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated . <EOS>	98.85145581676578
<SOS> all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child 's play . <EOS>	64.2939823041543
<SOS> if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business , you must assist me by the most minute information on every point . '' <EOS>	72.17365680798159
<SOS> `` pray ask me whatever questions you please ; for , in good truth , you see more clearly into my life than i do myself . '' <EOS>	63.9852745394328
<SOS> `` in the first place , then , who examined you , the king 's attorney , his deputy , or a magistrate ? '' <EOS>	85.03073839334574
<SOS> `` the deputy . '' <EOS>	96.92993687723755
<SOS> `` was he young or old ? '' <EOS>	109.24107122188938
<SOS> `` about six or seven and twenty years of age , i should say . '' <EOS>	90.66842275855258
<SOS> `` so , '' answered the abbé . <EOS>	95.52935758779714
<SOS> `` old enough to be ambitious , but too young to be corrupt . <EOS>	95.54107345396478
<SOS> and how did he treat you ? '' <EOS>	68.31779762668008
<SOS> `` with more of mildness than severity . '' <EOS>	61.59321710020478
<SOS> `` did you tell him your whole story ? '' <EOS>	58.293703631100975
<SOS> `` i did . '' <EOS>	41.368969840059265
<SOS> `` and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination ? '' <EOS>	73.38359316322345
<SOS> `` he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape . <EOS>	83.34519458024158
<SOS> he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune . '' <EOS>	92.6921481379998
<SOS> `` by your misfortune ? '' <EOS>	48.71620040990038
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	52.6366767554576
<SOS> `` then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored ? '' <EOS>	71.44013529650623
<SOS> `` he gave me one great proof of his sympathy , at any rate . '' <EOS>	73.22413447835234
<SOS> `` and that ? '' <EOS>	76.96076108004597
<SOS> `` he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me . '' <EOS>	51.90488418790303
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	100.89814004807283
<SOS> the accusation ? '' <EOS>	83.60098246878434
<SOS> `` no ; the letter . '' <EOS>	72.41332031230947
<SOS> `` are you sure ? '' <EOS>	48.55749462655156
<SOS> `` i saw it done . '' <EOS>	78.58285346093457
<SOS> `` that alters the case . <EOS>	102.90403098470154
<SOS> this man might , after all , be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible . '' <EOS>	68.88512989193985
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' said dantès , `` you make me shudder . <EOS>	42.196512669308056
<SOS> is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles ? '' <EOS>	117.5279940792066
<SOS> `` yes ; and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others . '' <EOS>	79.53891062918898
<SOS> `` never mind ; let us go on . '' <EOS>	86.09500426730834
<SOS> `` with all my heart ! <EOS>	89.25428046193231
<SOS> you tell me he burned the letter ? '' <EOS>	83.55892191993615
<SOS> `` he did ; saying at the same time , 'you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you . ' '' <EOS>	112.11353033067704
<SOS> `` this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural . '' <EOS>	76.18831970332518
<SOS> `` you think so ? '' <EOS>	70.7259303223714
<SOS> `` i am sure of it . <EOS>	43.93652362746629
<SOS> to whom was this letter addressed ? '' <EOS>	72.91832242751597
<SOS> `` to m. noirtier , rue coq héron , no . <EOS>	88.85567840693835
<SOS> < num > , paris . '' <EOS>	100.73361207436398
<SOS> `` now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter ? '' <EOS>	86.82809645470522
<SOS> `` why , it is not altogether impossible he might have had , for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone , assuring me he so advised me for my own interest ; and , more than this , he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address . '' <EOS>	96.681582257222
<SOS> `` noirtier ! '' <EOS>	69.02093181441418
<SOS> repeated the abbé ; `` noirtier ! <EOS>	51.205695249585624
<SOS> i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria , a noirtier , who had been a girondin during the revolution ! <EOS>	45.07226667131917
<SOS> what was your deputy called ? '' <EOS>	60.95210882178701
<SOS> `` de villefort ! '' <EOS>	74.74383281081933
<SOS> the abbé burst into a fit of laughter , while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment . <EOS>	82.2966333615767
<SOS> `` what ails you ? '' <EOS>	76.92056489834054
<SOS> said he at length . <EOS>	60.329603028345645
<SOS> `` do you see that ray of sunlight ? '' <EOS>	49.79363473366797
<SOS> `` i do . '' <EOS>	44.59816702074664
<SOS> `` well , the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you . <EOS>	54.297968201537444
<SOS> poor fellow ! <EOS>	73.2920021207431
<SOS> poor young man ! <EOS>	122.30590366257243
<SOS> and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you ? '' <EOS>	84.15322563260871
<SOS> `` he did . '' <EOS>	84.10216933944179
<SOS> `` and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter ? '' <EOS>	69.87032995554674
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	78.73388006370337
<SOS> `` and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier ? '' <EOS>	77.29232035170712
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	76.5811435270447
<SOS> `` why , you poor short sighted simpleton , can you not guess who this noirtier was , whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed ? <EOS>	71.34409687925096
<SOS> this noirtier was his father ! '' <EOS>	75.6205912412383
<SOS> had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès , or hell opened its yawning gulf before him , he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words . <EOS>	42.68175109645851
<SOS> starting up , he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting , and exclaimed , `` his father ! <EOS>	63.50259734452442
<SOS> his father ! '' <EOS>	104.3669799457082
<SOS> `` yes , his father , '' replied the abbé ; `` his right name was noirtier de villefort . '' <EOS>	106.48655222545223
<SOS> at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès , and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before . <EOS>	81.16569804543819
<SOS> the change that had come over villefort during the examination , the destruction of the letter , the exacted promise , the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate , who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment , all returned with a stunning force to his memory . <EOS>	57.08488360991279
<SOS> he cried out , and staggered against the wall like a drunken man , then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé 's cell to his own , and said , `` i must be alone , to think over all this . '' <EOS>	75.00887401349301
<SOS> when he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed , where the turnkey found him in the evening visit , sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , dumb and motionless as a statue . <EOS>	53.87628186000521
<SOS> during these hours of profound meditation , which to him had seemed only minutes , he had formed a fearful resolution , and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath . <EOS>	71.21694514294694
<SOS> dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria , who , having also been visited by his jailer , had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper . <EOS>	54.96897024448368
<SOS> the reputation of being out of his mind , though harmlessly and even amusingly so , had procured for the abbé unusual privileges . <EOS>	62.64086351784856
<SOS> he was supplied with bread of a finer , whiter quality than the usual prison fare , and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine . <EOS>	80.99132616904018
<SOS> now this was a sunday , and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him . <EOS>	67.799818674607
<SOS> dantès followed him ; his features were no longer contracted , and now wore their usual expression , but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve . <EOS>	102.5015805627674
<SOS> faria bent on him his penetrating eye . <EOS>	101.44268392814625
<SOS> `` i regret now , '' said he , `` having helped you in your late inquiries , or having given you the information i did . '' <EOS>	84.54271753997322
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	70.46815865007571
<SOS> inquired dantès . <EOS>	72.97807035991728
<SOS> `` because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance . '' <EOS>	76.43074713303594
<SOS> dantès smiled . <EOS>	83.42629545339645
<SOS> `` let us talk of something else , '' said he . <EOS>	97.11847556060845
<SOS> again the abbé looked at him , then mournfully shook his head ; but in accordance with dantès ' request , he began to speak of other matters . <EOS>	85.50535275998327
<SOS> the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation , like that of all who have experienced many trials , contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information ; but it was never egotistical , for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows . <EOS>	90.72446159797924
<SOS> dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said ; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew , or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire . <EOS>	74.30803060845625
<SOS> a part of the good abbé 's words , however , were wholly incomprehensible to him ; but , like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes , opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener , and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons , enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth , where he was so much at home . <EOS>	99.9940001123725
<SOS> `` you must teach me a small part of what you know , '' said dantès , `` if only to prevent your growing weary of me . <EOS>	55.06569405399008
<SOS> i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself . <EOS>	75.85784198875798
<SOS> if you will only agree to my request , i promise you never to mention another word about escaping . '' <EOS>	99.79365929320427
<SOS> the abbé smiled . <EOS>	41.60124751088007
<SOS> `` alas , my boy , '' said he , `` human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits ; and when i have taught you mathematics , physics , history , and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted , you will know as much as i do myself . <EOS>	91.75579549362794
<SOS> now , it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess . '' <EOS>	68.41005916182544
<SOS> `` two years ! '' <EOS>	91.30227036528476
<SOS> exclaimed dantès ; `` do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time ? '' <EOS>	74.04549472003596
<SOS> `` not their application , certainly , but their principles you may ; to learn is not to know ; there are the learners and the learned . <EOS>	71.16387496132683
<SOS> memory makes the one , philosophy the other . '' <EOS>	91.0763447528243
<SOS> `` but can not one learn philosophy ? '' <EOS>	67.58928667175931
<SOS> `` philosophy can not be taught ; it is the application of the sciences to truth ; it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven . '' <EOS>	88.50082514401636
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said dantès , `` what shall you teach me first ? <EOS>	98.31786541914605
<SOS> i am in a hurry to begin . <EOS>	74.87397099810195
<SOS> i want to learn . '' <EOS>	77.89204438151722
<SOS> `` everything , '' said the abbé . <EOS>	51.20983166313689
<SOS> and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education , to be entered upon the following day . <EOS>	101.97689377141337
<SOS> dantès possessed a prodigious memory , combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception ; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation , while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation , or the rigid severity of geometry . <EOS>	88.55604675984921
<SOS> he already knew italian , and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east ; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others , so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish , english , and german . <EOS>	58.2532916169607
<SOS> in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé , dantès spoke no more of escape . <EOS>	57.75924258898647
<SOS> perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts ; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word ( on which his sense of honor was keen ) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight . <EOS>	77.92781334494397
<SOS> days , even months , passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course . <EOS>	99.38702123563252
<SOS> at the end of a year dantès was a new man . <EOS>	65.70513424679099
<SOS> dantès observed , however , that faria , in spite of the relief his society afforded , daily grew sadder ; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind . <EOS>	84.55459727376154
<SOS> sometimes he would fall into long reveries , sigh heavily and involuntarily , then suddenly rise , and , with folded arms , begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon . <EOS>	61.07836196893068
<SOS> one day he stopped all at once , and exclaimed : `` ah , if there were no sentinel ! '' <EOS>	68.80059662903166
<SOS> `` there shall not be one a minute longer than you please , '' said dantès , who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations . <EOS>	115.76506729002216
<SOS> `` i have already told you , '' answered the abbé , `` that i loathe the idea of shedding blood . '' <EOS>	91.22203749257449
<SOS> `` and yet the murder , if you choose to call it so , would be simply a measure of self preservation . '' <EOS>	73.53786072822473
<SOS> `` no matter ! <EOS>	66.70462483532374
<SOS> i could never agree to it . '' <EOS>	58.77790882821122
<SOS> `` still , you have thought of it ? '' <EOS>	47.04854042549717
<SOS> `` incessantly , alas ! '' <EOS>	104.68909724929648
<SOS> cried the abbé . <EOS>	60.613948544547846
<SOS> `` and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom , have you not ? '' <EOS>	46.910393510374675
<SOS> asked dantès eagerly . <EOS>	81.13570226070644
<SOS> `` i have ; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us . '' <EOS>	85.4790364008722
<SOS> `` he shall be both blind and deaf , '' replied the young man , with an air of determination that made his companion shudder . <EOS>	55.8667636382227
<SOS> `` no , no , '' cried the abbé ; `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	67.62798085752065
<SOS> dantès endeavored to renew the subject ; the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval , and refused to make any further response . <EOS>	81.56824818338681
<SOS> three months passed away . <EOS>	58.724119463082516
<SOS> `` are you strong ? '' <EOS>	63.01779651008931
<SOS> the abbé asked one day of dantès . <EOS>	69.88245617641888
<SOS> the young man , in reply , took up the chisel , bent it into the form of a horseshoe , and then as readily straightened it . <EOS>	95.70799236351408
<SOS> `` and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry , except as a last resort ? '' <EOS>	46.9226305245559
<SOS> `` i promise on my honor . '' <EOS>	71.7353188504245
<SOS> `` then , '' said the abbé , `` we may hope to put our design into execution . '' <EOS>	94.38499617464055
<SOS> `` and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work ? '' <EOS>	62.94577863246795
<SOS> `` at least a year . '' <EOS>	76.77652232955532
<SOS> `` and shall we begin at once ? '' <EOS>	77.63825850052609
<SOS> `` at once . '' <EOS>	75.95761206177335
<SOS> `` we have lost a year to no purpose ! '' <EOS>	86.16686650759237
<SOS> cried dantès . <EOS>	85.80587609948832
<SOS> `` do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted ? '' <EOS>	70.34220909318633
<SOS> asked the abbé . <EOS>	75.62054649227493
<SOS> `` forgive me ! '' <EOS>	110.18177553684511
<SOS> cried edmond , blushing deeply . <EOS>	75.44364706855626
<SOS> `` tut , tut ! '' <EOS>	69.36392756322115
<SOS> answered the abbé , `` man is but man after all , and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known . <EOS>	58.46501948792345
<SOS> come , let me show you my plan . '' <EOS>	69.97595933408772
<SOS> the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape . <EOS>	42.926069711435076
<SOS> it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès , with the passage which united them . <EOS>	66.35282482064703
<SOS> in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines ; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch ; once there , a large excavation would be made , and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier , who , stunned by his fall , would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance . <EOS>	56.011060273687924
<SOS> the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows , and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé 's ladder of cords . <EOS>	101.59138025702681
<SOS> dantès ' eyes sparkled with joy , and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple , yet apparently so certain to succeed . <EOS>	78.96983340103647
<SOS> that very day the miners began their labors , with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success . <EOS>	88.24412553800272
<SOS> nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey 's visits . <EOS>	53.73771104481413
<SOS> they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons , and happily , never failed of being prepared for his coming . <EOS>	77.41499855153216
<SOS> the fresh earth excavated during their present work , and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage , was thrown , by degrees and with the utmost precaution , out of the window in either faria 's or dantès ' cell , the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain . <EOS>	77.93686033356376
<SOS> more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking , the only tools for which had been a chisel , a knife , and a wooden lever ; faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him , sometimes in one language , sometimes in another ; at others , relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory . <EOS>	64.70135596693021
<SOS> the abbé was a man of the world , and had , moreover , mixed in the first society of the day ; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès , thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature , easily acquired , as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in , and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding . <EOS>	44.639780538757954
<SOS> at the end of fifteen months the level was finished , and the excavation completed beneath the gallery , and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads . <EOS>	86.21229335277224
<SOS> compelled , as they were , to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight , they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive ; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time , and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way . <EOS>	77.53622762629392
<SOS> dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria , who had remained in edmond 's cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder , call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering . <EOS>	61.35869244894569
<SOS> dantès hastened to his dungeon , where he found him standing in the middle of the room , pale as death , his forehead streaming with perspiration , and his hands clenched tightly together . <EOS>	75.65543282336897
<SOS> `` gracious heavens ! '' <EOS>	59.504565964099775
<SOS> exclaimed dantès , `` what is the matter ? <EOS>	76.59560044384313
<SOS> what has happened ? '' <EOS>	72.56858234386003
<SOS> `` quick ! <EOS>	77.19664303630142
<SOS> quick ! '' <EOS>	76.63207005548416
<SOS> returned the abbé , `` listen to what i have to say . '' <EOS>	66.05662043063336
<SOS> dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria , whose eyes , already dull and sunken , were surrounded by purple circles , while his lips were white as those of a corpse , and his very hair seemed to stand on end . <EOS>	96.79645716860975
<SOS> `` tell me , i beseech you , what ails you ? '' <EOS>	51.915469587349556
<SOS> cried dantès , letting his chisel fall to the floor . <EOS>	46.76770461838159
<SOS> `` alas , '' faltered out the abbé , `` all is over with me . <EOS>	57.423171125094946
<SOS> i am seized with a terrible , perhaps mortal illness ; i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching . <EOS>	87.40260167493602
<SOS> i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment . <EOS>	66.91057728041001
<SOS> this malady admits but of one remedy ; i will tell you what that is . <EOS>	71.68436929002826
<SOS> go into my cell as quickly as you can ; draw out one of the feet that support the bed ; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid . <EOS>	86.72125466763856
<SOS> bring it to me or rather no , no ! <EOS>	76.79491083921525
<SOS> i may be found here , therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along . <EOS>	102.50286980280721
<SOS> who knows what may happen , or how long the attack may last ? '' <EOS>	63.30640238054467
<SOS> in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes , dantès did not lose his presence of mind , but descended into the passage , dragging his unfortunate companion with him ; then , half carrying , half supporting him , he managed to reach the abbé 's chamber , when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed . <EOS>	75.81346689740954
<SOS> `` thanks , '' said the poor abbé , shivering as though his veins were filled with ice . <EOS>	101.03297898337777
<SOS> `` i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy ; when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead , uttering neither sigh nor groan . <EOS>	49.717933986986
<SOS> on the other hand , the symptoms may be much more violent , and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions , foam at the mouth , and cry out loudly . <EOS>	65.64350900379829
<SOS> take care my cries are not heard , for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison , and we be separated forever . <EOS>	99.42981397731354
<SOS> when i become quite motionless , cold , and rigid as a corpse , then , and not before , be careful about this , force open my teeth with the knife , pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat , and i may perhaps revive . '' <EOS>	72.23984903093695
<SOS> `` perhaps ! '' <EOS>	53.408686190929245
<SOS> exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones . <EOS>	76.76993850823212
<SOS> `` help ! <EOS>	114.07106408265103
<SOS> help ! '' <EOS>	118.69421135641643
<SOS> cried the abbé , `` i i die i `` < num > m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence ; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame , his eyes started from their sockets , his mouth was drawn on one side , his cheeks became purple , he struggled , foamed , dashed himself about , and uttered the most dreadful cries , which , however , dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket . <EOS>	116.98735881844608
<SOS> the fit lasted two hours ; then , more helpless than an infant , and colder and paler than marble , more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot , he fell back , doubled up in one last convulsion , and became as rigid as a corpse . <EOS>	56.19705090789203
<SOS> edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend , then , taking up the knife , he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws , carefully administered the appointed number of drops , and anxiously awaited the result . <EOS>	111.52970173938684
<SOS> an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation . <EOS>	47.89595401220112
<SOS> dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy , and , thrusting his hands into his hair , continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend . <EOS>	90.85264032958501
<SOS> at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks , consciousness returned to the dull , open eyeballs , a faint sigh issued from the lips , and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move . <EOS>	75.22316734707059
<SOS> `` he is saved ! <EOS>	73.87130698780943
<SOS> he is saved ! '' <EOS>	95.8983864516897
<SOS> cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight . <EOS>	54.83464276647678
<SOS> the sick man was not yet able to speak , but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door . <EOS>	60.27981266918748
<SOS> dantès listened , and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer . <EOS>	92.92880308903037
<SOS> it was therefore near seven o'clock ; but edmond 's anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head . <EOS>	102.581493599421
<SOS> the young man sprang to the entrance , darted through it , carefully drawing the stone over the opening , and hurried to his cell . <EOS>	87.23078113180743
<SOS> he had scarcely done so before the door opened , and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed . <EOS>	69.15867440920789
<SOS> almost before the key had turned in the lock , and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse , dantès , whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him , hurried back to the abbé 's chamber , and raising the stone by pressing his head against it , was soon beside the sick man 's couch . <EOS>	52.658632452978175
<SOS> faria had now fully regained his consciousness , but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed . <EOS>	63.61440757042706
<SOS> `` i did not expect to see you again , '' said he feebly , to dantès . <EOS>	62.03528715192838
<SOS> `` and why not ? '' <EOS>	96.9638100373421
<SOS> asked the young man . <EOS>	71.55538738404877
<SOS> `` did you fancy yourself dying ? '' <EOS>	95.35272919870386
<SOS> `` no , i had no such idea ; but , knowing that all was ready for flight , i thought you might have made your escape . '' <EOS>	84.3611597630284
<SOS> the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès . <EOS>	44.01655580613497
<SOS> `` without you ? <EOS>	112.39632387719688
<SOS> did you really think me capable of that ? '' <EOS>	75.52660481320714
<SOS> `` at least , '' said the abbé , `` i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been . <EOS>	89.88990320480269
<SOS> alas , alas ! <EOS>	74.40594363166596
<SOS> i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack . '' <EOS>	71.80146660824197
<SOS> `` be of good cheer , '' replied dantès ; `` your strength will return . '' <EOS>	81.14789412127776
<SOS> and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria , and took his hands . <EOS>	44.82515315356975
<SOS> the abbé shook his head . <EOS>	65.4169789678896
<SOS> `` the last attack i had , '' said he , `` lasted but half an hour , and after it i was hungry , and got up without help ; now i can move neither my right arm nor leg , and my head seems uncomfortable , which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain . <EOS>	49.59895222791092
<SOS> the third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life . '' <EOS>	84.60512566407881
<SOS> `` no , no , '' cried dantès ; `` you are mistaken you will not die ! <EOS>	98.45892695906568
<SOS> and your third attack ( if , indeed , you should have another ) will find you at liberty . <EOS>	60.44281128518643
<SOS> we shall save you another time , as we have done this , only with a better chance of success , because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance . '' <EOS>	78.10427387223592
<SOS> `` my good edmond , '' answered the abbé , `` be not deceived . <EOS>	45.87240759471507
<SOS> the attack which has just passed away , condemns me forever to the walls of a prison . <EOS>	51.458960429472796
<SOS> none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk . '' <EOS>	57.7044333847684
<SOS> `` well , we will wait , a week , a month , two months , if need be , and meanwhile your strength will return . <EOS>	118.62343189213603
<SOS> everything is in readiness for our flight , and we can select any time we choose . <EOS>	69.79704931871727
<SOS> as soon as you feel able to swim we will go . '' <EOS>	67.36732055285223
<SOS> `` i shall never swim again , '' replied faria . <EOS>	76.33823577841845
<SOS> `` this arm is paralyzed ; not for a time , but forever . <EOS>	73.62987778461633
<SOS> lift it , and judge if i am mistaken . '' <EOS>	57.428843194161956
<SOS> the young man raised the arm , which fell back by its own weight , perfectly inanimate and helpless . <EOS>	116.73471081037965
<SOS> a sigh escaped him . <EOS>	84.25445997097978
<SOS> `` you are convinced now , edmond , are you not ? '' <EOS>	74.00776150584613
<SOS> asked the abbé . <EOS>	71.48041349641947
<SOS> `` depend upon it , i know what i say . <EOS>	89.03208899965324
<SOS> since the first attack i experienced of this malady , i have continually reflected on it . <EOS>	76.93868339471844
<SOS> indeed , i expected it , for it is a family inheritance ; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack . <EOS>	68.16847947831613
<SOS> the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me . '' <EOS>	78.54694030043832
<SOS> < num > m `` the physician may be mistaken ! '' <EOS>	54.471114545451464
<SOS> exclaimed dantès . <EOS>	79.9878098166259
<SOS> `` and as for your poor arm , what difference will that make ? <EOS>	102.74129292275515
<SOS> i can take you on my shoulders , and swim for both of us . '' <EOS>	73.67601031157794
<SOS> `` my son , '' said the abbé , `` you , who are a sailor and a swimmer , must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes . <EOS>	118.55326894500858
<SOS> cease , then , to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes , that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in . <EOS>	48.77544743158261
<SOS> here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives , and that , in all human probability , will be the hour of my death . <EOS>	85.94271693756802
<SOS> as for you , who are young and active , delay not on my account , but fly go i give you back your promise . '' <EOS>	76.68649395038744
<SOS> `` it is well , '' said dantès . <EOS>	51.95479850378519
<SOS> `` then i shall also remain . '' <EOS>	120.14588826596452
<SOS> then , rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man 's head , he slowly added , `` by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live . '' <EOS>	42.16679347757302
<SOS> faria gazed fondly on his noble minded , single hearted , high principled young friend , and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose . <EOS>	82.60215325621947
<SOS> `` thanks , '' murmured the invalid , extending one hand . <EOS>	83.08795763907773

<SOS> the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity , he found faria seated and looking composed . <EOS>	59.81616141136115
<SOS> in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell , he held open in his left hand , of which alone , it will be recollected , he retained the use , a sheet of paper , which , from being constantly rolled into a small compass , had the form of a cylinder , and was not easily kept open . <EOS>	69.97710547168828

<SOS> `` this paper , my friend , '' said faria , `` i may now avow to you , since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure , of which , from this day forth , one half belongs to you . '' <EOS>	78.32009121889614
<SOS> the sweat started forth on dantès ' brow . <EOS>	43.54632268603597
<SOS> until this day and for how long a time ! <EOS>	89.11842201480546
<SOS> he had refrained from talking of the treasure , which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness . <EOS>	60.787062945644344
<SOS> with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord , and faria had been equally silent . <EOS>	66.70582657746259
<SOS> he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason ; and now these few words uttered by faria , after so painful a crisis , seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation . <EOS>	70.2799608611393
<SOS> `` your treasure ? '' <EOS>	58.57317412135654
<SOS> stammered dantès . <EOS>	79.2963982924767
<SOS> faria smiled . <EOS>	80.46122614368997
<SOS> `` yes , '' said he . <EOS>	72.65602029532944
<SOS> `` you have , indeed , a noble nature , edmond , and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment . <EOS>	79.40096770023332

<SOS> `` alas , '' murmured edmond to himself , `` this is a terrible relapse ! <EOS>	75.33799591951204
<SOS> there was only this blow wanting . '' <EOS>	53.94512479772351

<SOS> `` on the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , edmond ! '' <EOS>	99.24211437668332

<SOS> yes , indeed , i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches , which would make the wealth of a dozen families , will be forever lost to those men who persecute me . <EOS>	76.907848295165
<SOS> this idea was one of vengeance to me , and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity . <EOS>	105.83872173874352
<SOS> but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you ; now that i see you , young and with a promising future , now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure , i shudder at any delay , and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth . '' <EOS>	66.97460492626412
<SOS> edmond turned away his head with a sigh . <EOS>	70.43054781277941
<SOS> `` you persist in your incredulity , edmond , '' continued faria . <EOS>	85.25874337101936
<SOS> `` my words have not convinced you . <EOS>	84.52602106547043
<SOS> i see you require proofs . <EOS>	72.00902121360876
<SOS> well , then , read this paper , which i have never shown to anyone . '' <EOS>	73.8186529506996
<SOS> `` tomorrow , my dear friend , '' said edmond , desirous of not yielding to the old man 's madness . <EOS>	93.20546831157569
<SOS> `` i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow . '' <EOS>	116.30356832456575
<SOS> `` then we will not talk of it until tomorrow ; but read this paper today . '' <EOS>	51.84291643149417
<SOS> `` i will not irritate him , '' thought edmond , and taking the paper , of which half was wanting , having been burnt , no doubt , by some accident , he read : `` this treasure , which may amount to two ... of roman crowns in the most distant a ... of the second opening wh ... declare to belong to him alo ... heir . <EOS>	102.07205493168946
<SOS> `` < num > th april , < num > ' '' `` well ! '' <EOS>	85.22558247397205
<SOS> said faria , when the young man had finished reading it . <EOS>	95.39235141162732
<SOS> `` why , '' replied dantès , `` i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words , which are rendered illegible by fire . '' <EOS>	66.83997398903875
<SOS> `` yes , to you , my friend , who read them for the first time ; but not for me , who have grown pale over them by many nights ' study , and have reconstructed every phrase , completed every thought . '' <EOS>	76.95325794901653
<SOS> `` and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning ? '' <EOS>	73.80845390441155
<SOS> `` i am sure i have , and you shall judge for yourself ; but first listen to the history of this paper . '' <EOS>	70.29460605554148
<SOS> `` silence ! '' <EOS>	83.19578041517899
<SOS> exclaimed dantès . <EOS>	74.39460931726987
<SOS> `` steps approach i go adieu ! '' <EOS>	65.54460574568255
<SOS> and dantès , happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend 's mental instability , glided like a snake along the narrow passage ; while faria , restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity , pushed the stone into place with his foot , and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery . <EOS>	55.1956738013836
<SOS> it was the governor , who , hearing of faria 's illness from the jailer , had come in person to see him . <EOS>	120.50505722851044
<SOS> faria sat up to receive him , avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death . <EOS>	69.49270818931785
<SOS> his fear was lest the governor , touched with pity , might order him to be removed to better quarters , and thus separate him from his young companion . <EOS>	42.30768605168007
<SOS> but fortunately this was not the case , and the governor left him , convinced that the poor madman , for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection , was only troubled with a slight indisposition . <EOS>	60.420525353087534
<SOS> during this time , edmond , seated on his bed with his head in his hands , tried to collect his scattered thoughts . <EOS>	46.198496737521005
<SOS> faria , since their first acquaintance , had been on all points so rational and logical , so wonderfully sagacious , in fact , that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness . <EOS>	47.453785847215485
<SOS> was faria deceived as to his treasure , or was all the world deceived as to faria ? <EOS>	54.22539520420614
<SOS> dantès remained in his cell all day , not daring to return to his friend , thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced , once for all , that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible ! <EOS>	77.8978766146989
<SOS> but , towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by , faria , not seeing the young man appear , tried to move and get over the distance which separated them . <EOS>	49.63853681052161
<SOS> edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along ; his leg was inert , and he could no longer make use of one arm . <EOS>	61.96574171429354
<SOS> edmond was obliged to assist him , for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès ' chamber . <EOS>	84.44120564394149
<SOS> `` here i am , pursuing you remorselessly , '' he said with a benignant smile . <EOS>	78.39015397170137
<SOS> `` you thought to escape my munificence , but it is in vain . <EOS>	75.04946460115642
<SOS> listen to me . '' <EOS>	92.61008785225543
<SOS> edmond saw there was no escape , and placing the old man on his bed , he seated himself on the stool beside him . <EOS>	85.10505230036716
<SOS> `` you know , '' said the abbé , `` that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada , the last of the princes of that name . <EOS>	53.152016797509624
<SOS> i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew . <EOS>	56.4737677232678
<SOS> he was not rich , although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb , and i heard the phrase very often , 'as rich as a spada . ' <EOS>	67.92434436991311
<SOS> but he , like public rumor , lived on this reputation for wealth ; his palace was my paradise . <EOS>	64.32194537587901
<SOS> i was tutor to his nephews , who are dead ; and when he was alone in the world , i tried by absolute devotion to his will , to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness . <EOS>	72.91187583834667
<SOS> the cardinal 's house had no secrets for me . <EOS>	51.323937175200314
<SOS> i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes , and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts . <EOS>	78.69446661938593
<SOS> one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches , and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them , he looked at me , and , smiling bitterly , opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome . <EOS>	67.31661266315041
<SOS> there , in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi. , were the following lines , which i can never forget : `` 'the great wars of romagna had ended ; cæsar borgia , who had completed his conquest , had need of money to purchase all italy . <EOS>	51.27394516713128
<SOS> the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii . <EOS>	112.14187471138224
<SOS> king of france , who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses ; and it was necessary , therefore , to have recourse to some profitable scheme , which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy . <EOS>	101.3205469901624
<SOS> his holiness had an idea . <EOS>	79.32111001606462
<SOS> he determined to make two cardinals . ' <EOS>	95.8046949495234
<SOS> `` by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome , especially rich men this was the return the holy father looked for . <EOS>	70.43641250812058
<SOS> in the first place , he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held ; and then he had the two hats to sell besides . <EOS>	61.98236807124428
<SOS> there was a third point in view , which will appear hereafter . <EOS>	80.70334057923259
<SOS> `` the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals ; they were giovanni rospigliosi , who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see , and cæsar spada , one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility ; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope . <EOS>	40.89130577866601
<SOS> they were ambitious , and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments . <EOS>	42.210134628613964
<SOS> the result was , that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals , and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation , and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators . <EOS>	49.514682620553764
<SOS> < num > m `` it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation . <EOS>	70.9350957210676
<SOS> the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada , conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate , and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome . <EOS>	73.23695880386981
<SOS> then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner . <EOS>	68.50576119189621
<SOS> this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son . <EOS>	91.21411452465264
<SOS> cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends , that is to say , in the first place , the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard . <EOS>	107.01866789576302
<SOS> this key was furnished with a small iron point , a negligence on the part of the locksmith . <EOS>	89.5423714367585
<SOS> when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard , of which the lock was difficult , the person was pricked by this small point , and died next day . <EOS>	75.64389353175791
<SOS> then there was the ring with the lion 's head , which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand . <EOS>	70.5467413643028
<SOS> the lion bit the hand thus favored , and at the end of twenty four hours , the bite was mortal . <EOS>	60.6124932564197
<SOS> `` cæsar proposed to his father , that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard , or shake hands with them ; but alexander vi . <EOS>	69.24737672435164
<SOS> replied : 'now as to the worthy cardinals , spada and rospigliosi , let us ask both of them to dinner , something tells me that we shall get that money back . <EOS>	99.49629000492027
<SOS> besides , you forget , cæsar , an indigestion declares itself immediately , while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two . ' <EOS>	81.25172528031719
<SOS> cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning , and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner . <EOS>	60.70442711106704
<SOS> `` the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope , near san pierdarena , a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report . <EOS>	63.910875568822505
<SOS> rospigliosi , quite set up with his new dignities , went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner . <EOS>	64.87878644601575
<SOS> spada , a prudent man , and greatly attached to his only nephew , a young captain of the highest promise , took paper and pen , and made his will . <EOS>	73.70763487223176
<SOS> he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard ; but it appeared the servant did not find him . <EOS>	80.30743032260389
<SOS> `` spada knew what these invitations meant ; since christianity , so eminently civilizing , had made progress in rome , it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message , 'cæsar wills that you die . ' <EOS>	70.94690483387267
<SOS> but it was a legate à latere , who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope , 'his holiness requests you to dine with him . ' <EOS>	49.63667445384613
<SOS> `` spada set out about two o'clock to san pierdarena . <EOS>	56.520269753420976
<SOS> the pope awaited him . <EOS>	108.26950471014189
<SOS> the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew , in full costume , and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions . <EOS>	90.15655042438082
<SOS> spada turned pale , as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air , which proved that he had anticipated all , and that the snare was well spread . <EOS>	54.20656588535102
<SOS> `` they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message . <EOS>	77.35365148575687
<SOS> the nephew replied no ; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question . <EOS>	42.350966098606634
<SOS> it was too late , for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine , placed for him expressly by the pope 's butler . <EOS>	53.54097585029497
<SOS> spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him , which he was pressed to taste . <EOS>	63.22915674550182
<SOS> an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms . <EOS>	58.975228266996055
<SOS> spada died on the threshold of the vineyard ; the nephew expired at his own door , making signs which his wife could not comprehend . <EOS>	72.94193537179784
<SOS> `` then cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage , under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man . <EOS>	74.87987716372736
<SOS> but the inheritance consisted in this only , a scrap of paper on which spada had written : ' i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers , my books , and , amongst others , my breviary with the gold corners , which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle . ' <EOS>	94.63928935190792
<SOS> `` the heirs sought everywhere , admired the breviary , laid hands on the furniture , and were greatly astonished that spada , the rich man , was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science , contained in the library and laboratories . <EOS>	70.47465457048186
<SOS> that was all . <EOS>	64.44917879808906
<SOS> cæsar and his father searched , examined , scrutinized , but found nothing , or at least very little ; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate , and about the same in ready money ; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired : 'look well among my uncle 's papers ; there is a will . ' <EOS>	60.157127346059774
<SOS> `` they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done , but it was fruitless . <EOS>	104.23051069281975
<SOS> there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill ; but in these days landed property had not much value , and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son . <EOS>	105.17238030003354
<SOS> months and years rolled on . <EOS>	77.7173019831448
<SOS> alexander vi . <EOS>	48.636922600174444
<SOS> died , poisoned , you know by what mistake . <EOS>	68.5362896438483
<SOS> cæsar , poisoned at the same time , escaped by shedding his skin like a snake ; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger 's . <EOS>	59.72093798402787
<SOS> then , compelled to quit rome , he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish , scarcely noticed in history . <EOS>	79.26933023132392
<SOS> `` after the pope 's death and his son 's exile , it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal 's time ; but this was not the case . <EOS>	73.52431560269874
<SOS> the spadas remained in doubtful ease , a mystery hung over this dark affair , and the public rumor was , that cæsar , a better politician than his father , had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals . <EOS>	109.38930037995938
<SOS> i say the two , because cardinal rospigliosi , who had not taken any precaution , was completely despoiled . <EOS>	60.4623864522842
<SOS> `` up to this point , '' said faria , interrupting the thread of his narrative , `` this seems to you very meaningless , no doubt , eh ? '' <EOS>	49.71908970432261
<SOS> `` oh , my friend , '' cried dantès , `` on the contrary , it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative ; go on , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	57.61710436366851
<SOS> `` i will . <EOS>	103.98136001919352
<SOS> the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity . <EOS>	90.64443104001045
<SOS> years rolled on , and amongst the descendants some were soldiers , others diplomatists ; some churchmen , some bankers ; some grew rich , and some were ruined . <EOS>	72.90824068983531
<SOS> i come now to the last of the family , whose secretary i was the count of spada . <EOS>	86.80946690513426
<SOS> i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune ; and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity . <EOS>	89.34070156866565
<SOS> he did so , and thus doubled his income . <EOS>	63.97140979847091
<SOS> the celebrated breviary remained in the family , and was in the count 's possession . <EOS>	72.50368497409875
<SOS> it had been handed down from father to son ; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found , had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic , preserved in the family with superstitious veneration . <EOS>	72.95302127604442
<SOS> it was an illuminated book , with beautiful gothic characters , and so weighty with gold , that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity . <EOS>	64.28545163008918
<SOS> `` at the sight of papers of all sorts , titles , contracts , parchments , which were kept in the archives of the family , all descending from the poisoned cardinal , i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents , like twenty servitors , stewards , secretaries before me ; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches , i found nothing . <EOS>	67.21464446477401
<SOS> yet i had read , i had even written a precise history of the borgia family , for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada ; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi , his companion in misfortune . <EOS>	49.884520296719344
<SOS> `` i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family , but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights , which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie . <EOS>	46.23972973226818
<SOS> i searched , ransacked , counted , calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years . <EOS>	43.55093522728197
<SOS> it was useless . <EOS>	58.81867396943061

<SOS> `` my patron died . <EOS>	79.2480277493823
<SOS> he had reserved from his annuity his family papers , his library , composed of five thousand volumes , and his famous breviary . <EOS>	69.04044265631002
<SOS> all these he bequeathed to me , with a thousand roman crowns , which he had in ready money , on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul , and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house . <EOS>	63.692509917698786
<SOS> all this i did scrupulously . <EOS>	86.95084359703924
<SOS> be easy , my dear edmond , we are near the conclusion . <EOS>	79.13535859521396
<SOS> `` in < num > , a month before i was arrested , and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada , on the < num > th of december ( you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory ) , i was reading , for the thousandth time , the papers i was arranging , for the palace was sold to a stranger , and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence , intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed , my library , and the famous breviary , when , tired with my constant labor at the same thing , and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten , my head dropped on my hands , and i fell asleep about three o'clock in the afternoon . <EOS>	70.62269258955706
<SOS> < num > m `` i awoke as the clock was striking six . <EOS>	68.75185919168007
<SOS> i raised my head ; i was in utter darkness . <EOS>	85.15713292650602
<SOS> i rang for a light , but , as no one came , i determined to find one for myself . <EOS>	59.265867968799554
<SOS> it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting . <EOS>	72.71205490841284
<SOS> i took a wax candle in one hand , and with the other groped about for a piece of paper ( my match box being empty ) , with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers . <EOS>	113.24993454304526
<SOS> fearing , however , to make use of any valuable piece of paper , i hesitated for a moment , then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary , which was on the table beside me , an old paper quite yellow with age , and which had served as a marker for centuries , kept there by the request of the heirs . <EOS>	58.93919925491953
<SOS> i felt for it , found it , twisted it up together , and putting it into the expiring flame , set light to it . <EOS>	63.255669370434106
<SOS> `` but beneath my fingers , as if by magic , in proportion as the fire ascended , i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper . <EOS>	98.06886683577227
<SOS> i grasped it in my hand , put out the flame as quickly as i could , lighted my taper in the fire itself , and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion , recognizing , when i had done so , that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink , only appearing when exposed to the fire ; nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame . <EOS>	75.53524548694182
<SOS> it was that paper you read this morning ; read it again , dantès , and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense . '' <EOS>	61.10825453508475
<SOS> faria , with an air of triumph , offered the paper to dantès , who this time read the following words , traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust : `` this < num > th day of april , < num > , be ... alexander vi. , and fearing that not ... he may desire to become my heir , and re ... and bentivoglio , who were poisoned , ... my sole heir , that i have bu ... and has visited with me , that is , in ... island of monte cristo , all i poss ... jewels , diamonds , gems ; that i alone ... may amount to nearly two mil ... will find on raising the twentieth ro ... creek to the east in a right line . <EOS>	99.15926070358641

<SOS> `` cæs ... `` and now , '' said the abbé , `` read this other paper ; '' and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it , which edmond read as follows : `` ... ing invited to dine by his holiness ... content with making me pay for my hat , ... serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara ... i declare to my nephew , guido spada ... ried in a place he knows ... the caves of the small ... essed of ingots , gold , money , ... know of the existence of this treasure , which ... lions of roman crowns , and which he ... ck from the small ... ings have been made ... ngle in the second ; ... tire to him ... ar † spada .

<SOS> faria followed him with an excited look . <EOS>	68.91997179917193
<SOS> `` and now , '' he said , when he saw that dantès had read the last line , `` put the two fragments together , and judge for yourself . '' <EOS>	102.69181862222972
<SOS> dantès obeyed , and the conjointed pieces gave the following : < num > m `` this < num > th day of april , < num > , be ... ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi. , and fearing that not ... content with making me pay for my hat , he may desire to become my heir , and re ... serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio , who were poisoned , ... i declare to my nephew , guido spada , my sole heir , that i have bu ... ried in a place he knows and has visited with me , that is , in ... the caves of the small island of monte cristo , all i poss ... essed of ingots , gold , money , jewels , diamonds , gems ; that i alone ... know of the existence of this treasure , which may amount to nearly two mil ... lions of roman crowns , and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro ... ck from the small creek to the east in a right line . <EOS>	99.40666823539856

<SOS> `` well , do you comprehend now ? '' <EOS>	88.88268041935663
<SOS> inquired faria . <EOS>	89.3427502411606
<SOS> `` it is the declaration of cardinal spada , and the will so long sought for , '' replied edmond , still incredulous . <EOS>	91.378149752473
<SOS> `` yes ; a thousand times , yes ! '' <EOS>	77.07067702851032
<SOS> `` and who completed it as it now is ? '' <EOS>	82.30828380375291
<SOS> `` i did . <EOS>	56.18680587558199
<SOS> aided by the remaining fragment , i guessed the rest ; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper , and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed , as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us . '' <EOS>	94.60092024861848
<SOS> `` and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion ? '' <EOS>	66.09749500621824
<SOS> `` i resolved to set out , and did set out at that very instant , carrying with me the beginning of my great work , the unity of the italian kingdom ; but for some time the imperial police ( who at this period , quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him , wished for a partition of provinces ) had their eyes on me ; and my hasty departure , the cause of which they were unable to guess , having aroused their suspicions , i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino . <EOS>	84.06322940357266
<SOS> `` now , '' continued faria , addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression , `` now , my dear fellow , you know as much as i do myself . <EOS>	70.30967736338324
<SOS> if we ever escape together , half this treasure is yours ; if i die here , and you escape alone , the whole belongs to you . '' <EOS>	66.4912994496481
<SOS> `` but , '' inquired dantès hesitating , `` has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves ? '' <EOS>	112.63989891612765
<SOS> `` no , no , be easy on that score ; the family is extinct . <EOS>	73.95809409400681
<SOS> the last count of spada , moreover , made me his heir , bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary , he bequeathed to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point . <EOS>	54.586555401166706
<SOS> if we lay hands on this fortune , we may enjoy it without remorse . '' <EOS>	64.72149051391465
<SOS> `` and you say this treasure amounts to `` `` two millions of roman crowns ; nearly thirteen millions of our money . <EOS>	93.82796547156892
<SOS> `` < num > `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	83.44660878034104
<SOS> said dantès , staggered at the enormous amount . <EOS>	97.87186439823235
<SOS> `` impossible ? <EOS>	84.18470050389806
<SOS> and why ? '' <EOS>	89.19930833019501
<SOS> asked the old man . <EOS>	69.94535373767012
<SOS> `` the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century ; and in those times , when other opportunities for investment were wanting , such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare ; there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger , though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels , handed down by entail , and which they can not touch . '' <EOS>	103.95818773255385
<SOS> edmond thought he was in a dream he wavered between incredulity and joy . <EOS>	70.93061085365676
<SOS> `` i have only kept this secret so long from you , '' continued faria , `` that i might test your character , and then surprise you . <EOS>	67.39840001435978
<SOS> had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy , i should have conducted you to monte cristo ; now , '' he added , with a sigh , `` it is you who will conduct me thither . <EOS>	49.50063056157208
<SOS> well , dantès , you do not thank me ? '' <EOS>	61.73740687331691
<SOS> `` this treasure belongs to you , my dear friend , '' replied dantès , `` and to you only . <EOS>	57.415070526412066
<SOS> i have no right to it . <EOS>	82.33908946171016
<SOS> i am no relation of yours . '' <EOS>	54.92044739387164
<SOS> `` you are my son , dantès , '' exclaimed the old man . <EOS>	44.30108051256649
<SOS> `` you are the child of my captivity . <EOS>	74.94432901087406
<SOS> my profession condemns me to celibacy . <EOS>	82.66384853093854
<SOS> god has sent you to me to console , at one and the same time , the man who could not be a father , and the prisoner who could not get free . '' <EOS>	94.11829741177154
<SOS> and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man , who threw himself upon his neck and wept . <EOS>	61.65556643221158
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	55.81294188401967
<SOS> the third attack now that this treasure , which had so long been the object of the abbé 's meditations , could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son , it had doubled its value in his eyes , and every day he expatiated on the amount , explaining to dantès all the good which , with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs , a man could do in these days to his friends ; and then dantès ' countenance became gloomy , for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory , and he reflected how much ill , in these times , a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies . <EOS>	57.29390172196933
<SOS> the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo ; but dantès knew it , and had often passed it , situated twenty five miles from pianosa , between corsica and the island of elba , and had once touched there . <EOS>	70.46562333509596
<SOS> this island was , always had been , and still is , completely deserted . <EOS>	77.34052275720367
<SOS> it is a rock of almost conical form , which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean . <EOS>	61.959447674209024
<SOS> dantès drew a plan of the island for faria , and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure . <EOS>	52.102765362208444
<SOS> but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man . <EOS>	48.71048217072986
<SOS> it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic , and the way in which he had achieved the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased edmond 's admiration of him ; but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit , supposing it had ever existed , still existed ; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical , he yet believed it was no longer there . <EOS>	58.581658795257276
<SOS> however , as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance , and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment , a new misfortune befell them ; the gallery on the sea side , which had long been in ruins , was rebuilt . <EOS>	55.54393581370579
<SOS> they had repaired it completely , and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in . <EOS>	82.4603897761187
<SOS> but for this precaution , which , it will be remembered , the abbé had made to edmond , the misfortune would have been still greater , for their attempt to escape would have been detected , and they would undoubtedly have been separated . <EOS>	70.634601611241
<SOS> thus a new , a stronger , and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes . <EOS>	103.63273338809721
<SOS> `` you see , '' said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to faria , `` that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you . <EOS>	59.070978989316934
<SOS> i have promised to remain forever with you , and now i could not break my promise if i would . <EOS>	56.727580485102166
<SOS> the treasure will be no more mine than yours , and neither of us will quit this prison . <EOS>	44.914859400871556
<SOS> but my real treasure is not that , my dear friend , which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo , it is your presence , our living together five or six hours a day , in spite of our jailers ; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain , the languages you have implanted in my memory , and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications . <EOS>	83.83466599814038
<SOS> these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them , and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure , my beloved friend , and with this you have made me rich and happy . <EOS>	92.17335614580492
<SOS> believe me , and take comfort , this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds , even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea , which we take for terra firma , and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them . <EOS>	75.07298810072407
<SOS> to have you as long as possible near me , to hear your eloquent speech , which embellishes my mind , strengthens my soul , and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things , if i should ever be free , so fills my whole existence , that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you , has no longer any hold over me ; and this this is my fortune not chimerical , but actual . <EOS>	80.36394376681461
<SOS> i owe you my real good , my present happiness ; and all the sovereigns of the earth , even cæsar borgia himself , could not deprive me of this . '' <EOS>	57.93209388868119
<SOS> thus , if not actually happy , yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly . <EOS>	90.24769133639401
<SOS> faria , who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure , now perpetually talked of it . <EOS>	83.77908291684743
<SOS> as he had prophesied would be the case , he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg , and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself . <EOS>	46.38678963271229
<SOS> but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion , and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy . <EOS>	70.66392310593685
<SOS> for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen , he compelled dantès to learn it by heart ; and dantès knew it from the first to the last word . <EOS>	79.13610929813062
<SOS> then he destroyed the second portion , assured that if the first were seized , no one would be able to discover its real meaning . <EOS>	48.49508624385819
<SOS> whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès , instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty . <EOS>	88.25730917890509
<SOS> then , once free , from the day and hour and moment when he was so , he could have but one only thought , which was , to gain monte cristo by some means , and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions ; and once there , to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns , and search in the appointed spot , the appointed spot , be it remembered , being the farthest angle in the second opening . <EOS>	64.78770005527288
<SOS> in the meanwhile the hours passed , if not rapidly , at least tolerably . <EOS>	73.05494138999296
<SOS> faria , as we have said , without having recovered the use of his hand and foot , had regained all the clearness of his understanding , and had gradually , besides the moral instructions we have detailed , taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner , who learns to make something from nothing . <EOS>	71.3233000543345
<SOS> they were thus perpetually employed , faria , that he might not see himself grow old ; dantès , for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night . <EOS>	72.89888122132649
<SOS> so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence . <EOS>	66.7688880241651
<SOS> but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man , and perhaps in that of the old man , many repressed desires , many stifled sighs , which found vent when faria was left alone , and when edmond returned to his cell . <EOS>	91.63866111232942
<SOS> one night edmond awoke suddenly , believing that he heard someone calling him . <EOS>	88.9818491123659
<SOS> he opened his eyes upon utter darkness . <EOS>	93.1795304328746
<SOS> his name , or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name , reached him . <EOS>	76.36671839571109
<SOS> he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow . <EOS>	54.389539546976735
<SOS> undoubtedly the call came from faria 's dungeon . <EOS>	93.04380310263248
<SOS> `` alas , '' murmured edmond ; `` can it be ? '' <EOS>	92.47883208269839
<SOS> he moved his bed , drew up the stone , rushed into the passage , and reached the opposite extremity ; the secret entrance was open . <EOS>	80.64820692030547
<SOS> by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp , of which we have spoken , dantès saw the old man , pale , but yet erect , clinging to the bedstead . <EOS>	51.192354564408674
<SOS> his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew , and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time . <EOS>	92.21710876323388
<SOS> `` alas , my dear friend , '' said faria in a resigned tone , `` you understand , do you not , and i need not attempt to explain to you ? '' <EOS>	83.67258055645041
<SOS> edmond uttered a cry of agony , and , quite out of his senses , rushed towards the door , exclaiming , `` help , help ! '' <EOS>	79.14115524669913
<SOS> faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him . <EOS>	60.803599024734446
<SOS> `` silence , '' he said , `` or you are lost . <EOS>	74.7694714401016
<SOS> we must now only think of you , my dear friend , and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible . <EOS>	58.60655950806085
<SOS> it would require years to do again what i have done here , and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other . <EOS>	45.6690542224978
<SOS> besides , be assured , my dear edmond , the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty ; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place , and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation . <EOS>	100.05452042160508
<SOS> perhaps he will be young , strong , and enduring , like yourself , and will aid you in your escape , while i have been but a hindrance . <EOS>	62.11376712782994
<SOS> you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements . <EOS>	93.7169671965034
<SOS> at length providence has done something for you ; he restores to you more than he takes away , and it was time i should die . '' <EOS>	76.90974962933359
<SOS> edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim , `` oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! '' <EOS>	75.36880532909721
<SOS> and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , `` oh , i have saved you once , and i will save you a second time ! '' <EOS>	69.6454696290337
<SOS> and raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor . <EOS>	81.09891237298898
<SOS> `` see , '' he exclaimed , `` there remains still some of the magic draught . <EOS>	78.6022419330795
<SOS> quick , quick ! <EOS>	94.05624691591602
<SOS> tell me what i must do this time ; are there any fresh instructions ? <EOS>	85.9024362505587
<SOS> speak , my friend ; i listen . '' <EOS>	83.60482909667309
<SOS> `` there is not a hope , '' replied faria , shaking his head , `` but no matter ; god wills it that man whom he has created , and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life , should do all in his power to preserve that existence , which , however painful it may be , is yet always so dear . '' <EOS>	70.40153767200121
<SOS> `` oh , yes , yes ! '' <EOS>	113.98574901920668
<SOS> exclaimed dantès ; `` and i tell you that i will save you yet . '' <EOS>	61.34987125064586
<SOS> `` well , then , try . <EOS>	59.199080794601635
<SOS> the cold gains upon me . <EOS>	111.54614774341997
<SOS> i feel the blood flowing towards my brain . <EOS>	60.03941585127421
<SOS> these horrible chills , which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones , begin to pervade my whole frame ; in five minutes the malady will reach its height , and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse . '' <EOS>	52.728969179332985
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	56.01167211938527
<SOS> exclaimed dantès , his heart wrung with anguish . <EOS>	91.64923648070977
<SOS> `` do as you did before , only do not wait so long , all the springs of life are now exhausted in me , and death , '' he continued , looking at his paralyzed arm and leg , `` has but half its work to do . <EOS>	79.83184236936101
<SOS> if , after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten , you see that i do not recover , then pour the rest down my throat . <EOS>	58.33574917406155
<SOS> now lift me on my bed , for i can no longer support myself . '' <EOS>	63.136408056698926
<SOS> edmond took the old man in his arms , and laid him on the bed . <EOS>	87.97417047205437
<SOS> `` and now , my dear friend , '' said faria , `` sole consolation of my wretched existence , you whom heaven gave me somewhat late , but still gave me , a priceless gift , and for which i am most grateful , at the moment of separating from you forever , i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve . <EOS>	94.83251436822616
<SOS> my son , i bless thee ! '' <EOS>	61.09833199900077

<SOS> my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth , and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches . <EOS>	74.22784424274371
<SOS> if you do escape , remember that the poor abbé , whom all the world called mad , was not so . <EOS>	85.64501896873004
<SOS> hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough . '' <EOS>	95.94912022549028
<SOS> a violent convulsion attacked the old man . <EOS>	74.14522884102377
<SOS> dantès raised his head and saw faria 's eyes injected with blood . <EOS>	83.13002109028533
<SOS> it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head . <EOS>	75.92227207246843
<SOS> `` adieu , adieu ! '' <EOS>	71.26382905525661
<SOS> murmured the old man , clasping edmond 's hand convulsively `` adieu ! '' <EOS>	86.97725150726868
<SOS> `` oh , no , no , not yet , '' he cried ; `` do not forsake me ! <EOS>	69.9763080244032

<SOS> `` hush ! <EOS>	101.45167093284067

<SOS> `` you are right . <EOS>	84.26540170590027

<SOS> `` do not mistake ! <EOS>	106.24484874340291

<SOS> at your age we have faith in life ; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope , but old men see death more clearly . <EOS>	114.26545271731551

<SOS> adieu ! <EOS>	62.16892061077518
<SOS> adieu ! '' <EOS>	60.18501478054154
<SOS> and raising himself by a final effort , in which he summoned all his faculties , he said , `` monte cristo , forget not monte cristo ! '' <EOS>	101.1521831897912
<SOS> and he fell back on the bed . <EOS>	80.9713413172352
<SOS> the crisis was terrible , and a rigid form with twisted limbs , swollen eyelids , and lips flecked with bloody foam , lay on the bed of torture , in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there . <EOS>	99.15867018746273
<SOS> dantès took the lamp , placed it on a projecting stone above the bed , whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless , stiffened body . <EOS>	114.13955160645064
<SOS> with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative . <EOS>	50.853880148970255
<SOS> when he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , pried open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the phial contained , perhaps , twice as much more . <EOS>	67.4322065408939
<SOS> he waited ten minutes , a quarter of an hour , half an hour , no change took place . <EOS>	81.4968776012091
<SOS> trembling , his hair erect , his brow bathed with perspiration , he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart . <EOS>	46.84817599718722
<SOS> then he thought it was time to make the last trial , and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria , and without having occasion to force open his jaws , which had remained extended , he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat . <EOS>	86.54798387827913
<SOS> < num > m the draught produced a galvanic effect , a violent trembling pervaded the old man 's limbs , his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them , he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek , and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility , the eyes remaining open . <EOS>	93.7769791197204
<SOS> half an hour , an hour , an hour and a half elapsed , and during this period of anguish , edmond leaned over his friend , his hand applied to his heart , and felt the body gradually grow cold , and the heart 's pulsation become more and more deep and dull , until at length it stopped ; the last movement of the heart ceased , the face became livid , the eyes remained open , but the eyeballs were glazed . <EOS>	82.22864353386154
<SOS> it was six o'clock in the morning , the dawn was just breaking , and its feeble ray came into the dungeon , and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp . <EOS>	44.07997070843624
<SOS> strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man , and at times gave it the appearance of life . <EOS>	95.32074848793879
<SOS> while the struggle between day and night lasted , dantès still doubted ; but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence , he saw that he was alone with a corpse . <EOS>	78.281903482853
<SOS> then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him , and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed , he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes , which he tried many times to close , but in vain they opened again as soon as shut . <EOS>	71.62116450627396
<SOS> he extinguished the lamp , carefully concealed it , and then went away , closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended . <EOS>	85.49104742879783
<SOS> it was time , for the jailer was coming . <EOS>	64.25482325489241
<SOS> on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès ' cell , and on leaving him he went on to faria 's dungeon , taking thither breakfast and some linen . <EOS>	96.47158900258843
<SOS> nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred . <EOS>	58.95906493696034
<SOS> he went on his way . <EOS>	64.59619232643283
<SOS> dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend . <EOS>	99.70517824330943
<SOS> he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery , and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey , who called out for help . <EOS>	97.09750512132541
<SOS> other turnkeys came , and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers . <EOS>	64.20222563104896
<SOS> last of all came the governor . <EOS>	75.94854192994723
<SOS> edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse , heard the voice of the governor , who asked them to throw water on the dead man 's face ; and seeing that , in spite of this application , the prisoner did not recover , they sent for the doctor . <EOS>	50.332545285386104
<SOS> the governor then went out , and words of pity fell on dantès ' listening ears , mingled with brutal laughter . <EOS>	66.65991105726391
<SOS> `` well , well , '' said one , `` the madman has gone to look after his treasure . <EOS>	93.43678994338066
<SOS> good journey to him ! '' <EOS>	93.99442656120237
<SOS> `` with all his millions , he will not have enough to pay for his shroud ! '' <EOS>	91.72813470285618
<SOS> said another . <EOS>	83.5582861354804
<SOS> `` oh , '' added a third voice , `` the shrouds of the château d'if are not dear ! '' <EOS>	56.38622971226467
<SOS> < num > m `` perhaps , '' said one of the previous speakers , `` as he was a churchman , they may go to some expense in his behalf . '' <EOS>	45.50237610603524
<SOS> `` they may give him the honors of the sack . '' <EOS>	76.54269427588484
<SOS> edmond did not lose a word , but comprehended very little of what was said . <EOS>	68.79446990914776
<SOS> the voices soon ceased , and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell . <EOS>	88.83241530184738
<SOS> still he dared not to enter , as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead . <EOS>	48.243519317798885
<SOS> he remained , therefore , mute and motionless , hardly venturing to breathe . <EOS>	88.93215416294078
<SOS> at the end of an hour , he heard a faint noise , which increased . <EOS>	89.19270008786364
<SOS> it was the governor who returned , followed by the doctor and other attendants . <EOS>	76.74088401178905
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence , it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body . <EOS>	91.80218232425105
<SOS> the inquiries soon commenced . <EOS>	74.56890980103141
<SOS> the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed , and declared that he was dead . <EOS>	55.828883958953156
<SOS> questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant , for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own . <EOS>	55.07169114119907
<SOS> `` i am very sorry for what you tell me , '' said the governor , replying to the assurance of the doctor , `` that the old man is really dead ; for he was a quiet , inoffensive prisoner , happy in his folly , and required no watching . '' <EOS>	82.86602252757801
<SOS> `` ah , '' added the turnkey , `` there was no occasion for watching him ; he would have stayed here fifty years , i 'll answer for it , without any attempt to escape . '' <EOS>	74.60418184611005
<SOS> `` still , '' said the governor , `` i believe it will be requisite , notwithstanding your certainty , and not that i doubt your science , but in discharge of my official duty , that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead . '' <EOS>	71.80168940480985
<SOS> there was a moment of complete silence , during which dantès , still listening , knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time . <EOS>	56.71417171003811
<SOS> `` you may make your mind easy , '' said the doctor ; `` he is dead . <EOS>	67.99866831107767
<SOS> i will answer for that . '' <EOS>	57.57365601857422
<SOS> `` you know , sir , '' said the governor , persisting , `` that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination . <EOS>	67.50726010817824
<SOS> in spite of all appearances , be so kind , therefore , as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law . '' <EOS>	72.82502169022915
<SOS> `` let the irons be heated , '' said the doctor ; `` but really it is a useless precaution . '' <EOS>	81.3364907027602
<SOS> this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder . <EOS>	88.83426139155101
<SOS> he heard hasty steps , the creaking of a door , people going and coming , and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered , saying : `` here is the brazier , lighted . '' <EOS>	69.88678697055
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence , and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh , of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror . <EOS>	71.43843193735425
<SOS> the perspiration poured forth upon the young man 's brow , and he felt as if he should faint . <EOS>	68.2035341754519
<SOS> `` you see , sir , he is really dead , '' said the doctor ; `` this burn in the heel is decisive . <EOS>	75.96960754541277
<SOS> the poor fool is cured of his folly , and delivered from his captivity . '' <EOS>	60.64508759256795
<SOS> `` was n't his name faria ? '' <EOS>	80.2164910003886
<SOS> inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor . <EOS>	97.02061050001949
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , sir ; and , as he said , it was an ancient name . <EOS>	73.02017235718843
<SOS> he was , too , very learned , and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure ; but on that , indeed , he was intractable . '' <EOS>	97.8879557268487
<SOS> `` it is the sort of malady which we call monomania , '' said the doctor . <EOS>	44.69168173809646
<SOS> `` you had never anything to complain of ? '' <EOS>	98.6793521006185
<SOS> said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé . <EOS>	46.40121034864789
<SOS> `` never , sir , '' replied the jailer , `` never ; on the contrary , he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories . <EOS>	107.62753891958822
<SOS> one day , too , when my wife was ill , he gave me a prescription which cured her . '' <EOS>	53.077754454020855
<SOS> `` ah , ah ! '' <EOS>	69.38346845557328
<SOS> said the doctor , `` i did not know that i had a rival ; but i hope , governor , that you will show him all proper respect in consequence . '' <EOS>	69.29775272996505
<SOS> `` yes , yes , make your mind easy , he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find . <EOS>	121.7928722755434
<SOS> will that satisfy you ? '' <EOS>	54.448673216862545
<SOS> `` must this last formality take place in your presence , sir ? '' <EOS>	67.47829458898238
<SOS> inquired a turnkey . <EOS>	55.0425329041439
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	51.54191829156242
<SOS> but make haste i can not stay here all day . '' <EOS>	83.97774175325253
<SOS> other footsteps , going and coming , were now heard , and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ' ears , the bed creaked , and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor ; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it . <EOS>	59.92412306264499
<SOS> `` this evening , '' said the governor . <EOS>	91.66263884650684
<SOS> `` will there be any mass ? '' <EOS>	108.5169626127415
<SOS> asked one of the attendants . <EOS>	70.9014534533322
<SOS> `` that is impossible , '' replied the governor . <EOS>	98.27795017840928
<SOS> `` the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence , in order to take a trip to hyères for a week . <EOS>	83.12277665355269
<SOS> i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence . <EOS>	65.27416626472197
<SOS> if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry , he might have had his requiem . '' <EOS>	80.1024652085204
<SOS> `` pooh , pooh ; '' said the doctor , with the impiety usual in persons of his profession ; `` he is a churchman . <EOS>	73.45935388067964
<SOS> god will respect his profession , and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest . '' <EOS>	56.372864530473976
<SOS> a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest . <EOS>	101.65159484701414
<SOS> meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on . <EOS>	61.53810635474983
<SOS> `` this evening , '' said the governor , when the task was ended . <EOS>	114.57115304692618
<SOS> `` at what hour ? '' <EOS>	83.62191193122361
<SOS> inquired a turnkey . <EOS>	75.28834919790958
<SOS> `` why , about ten or eleven o'clock . '' <EOS>	105.52970167469744
<SOS> `` shall we watch by the corpse ? '' <EOS>	79.21702631293728
<SOS> `` of what use would it be ? <EOS>	85.32714278097177
<SOS> shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all . '' <EOS>	101.05542319512377
<SOS> then the steps retreated , and the voices died away in the distance ; the noise of the door , with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased , and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued , the silence of death , which was all pervasive , and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès . <EOS>	76.35825488922633
<SOS> then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head , and looked carefully around the chamber . <EOS>	58.08227063344223
<SOS> it was empty , and dantès emerged from the tunnel . <EOS>	66.91221697266705
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	76.93974379358228
<SOS> the cemetery of the château d'if on the bed , at full length , and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window , lay a sack of canvas , and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form ; it was faria 's last winding sheet , a winding sheet which , as the turnkey said , cost so little . <EOS>	88.93574366152707
<SOS> everything was in readiness . <EOS>	86.3048978975493
<SOS> a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend . <EOS>	93.1560007809094
<SOS> no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death ; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed . <EOS>	74.44249553541101
<SOS> faria , the beneficent and cheerful companion , with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately , no longer breathed . <EOS>	67.77400314014773
<SOS> he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed , and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie . <EOS>	93.67355223563172
<SOS> alone ! <EOS>	45.5413545108336
<SOS> he was alone again ! <EOS>	61.04234191062052
<SOS> again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness ! <EOS>	92.31780508675904
<SOS> alone ! <EOS>	53.166270019474354
<SOS> never again to see the face , never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth ! <EOS>	103.9180103615991
<SOS> was not faria 's fate the better , after all to solve the problem of life at its source , even at the risk of horrible suffering ? <EOS>	63.12828999738933
<SOS> the idea of suicide , which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence , now hovered like a phantom over the abbé 's dead body . <EOS>	80.57500349110177
<SOS> `` if i could die , '' he said , `` i should go where he goes , and should assuredly find him again . <EOS>	42.57472242120422
<SOS> but how to die ? <EOS>	51.40523395724709
<SOS> it is very easy , '' he went on with a smile ; `` i will remain here , rush on the first person that opens the door , strangle him , and then they will guillotine me . '' <EOS>	109.12214701191951
<SOS> but excessive grief is like a storm at sea , where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave . <EOS>	66.38597056244468
<SOS> dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death , and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty . <EOS>	61.754428257181225
<SOS> `` die ? <EOS>	82.58763725565429
<SOS> oh , no , '' he exclaimed `` not die now , after having lived and suffered so long and so much ! <EOS>	78.95783467066894
<SOS> die ? <EOS>	100.70389363377033
<SOS> yes , had i died years ago ; but now to die would be , indeed , to give way to the sarcasm of destiny . <EOS>	76.37357897462081
<SOS> no , i want to live ; i shall struggle to the very last ; i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived . <EOS>	70.20276538117041
<SOS> before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish , and perhaps , too , who knows , some friends to reward . <EOS>	77.89267715215179
<SOS> yet they will forget me here , and i shall die in my dungeon like faria . '' <EOS>	92.04360081091221
<SOS> as he said this , he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought . <EOS>	58.40881707283858
<SOS> suddenly he arose , lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy , paced twice or thrice round the dungeon , and then paused abruptly by the bed . <EOS>	52.67154112452224
<SOS> `` just god ! '' <EOS>	79.89357922076458
<SOS> he muttered , `` whence comes this thought ? <EOS>	70.53600249758922
<SOS> is it from thee ? <EOS>	75.48420779267177
<SOS> since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon , let me take the place of the dead ! '' <EOS>	78.56029990087583
<SOS> without giving himself time to reconsider his decision , and , indeed , that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution , he bent over the appalling shroud , opened it with the knife which faria had made , drew the corpse from the sack , and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber , laid it on his couch , tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own , covered it with his counterpane , once again kissed the ice cold brow , and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes , which glared horribly , turned the head towards the wall , so that the jailer might , when he brought the evening meal , believe that he was asleep , as was his frequent custom ; entered the tunnel again , drew the bed against the wall , returned to the other cell , took from the hiding place the needle and thread , flung off his rags , that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas , and getting inside the sack , placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid , and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside . <EOS>	90.80981806524665
<SOS> he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart , if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment . <EOS>	48.10182177607928
<SOS> dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over , but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind , and order the dead body to be removed earlier . <EOS>	68.68079111210866
<SOS> in that case his last hope would have been destroyed . <EOS>	82.0812088631207
<SOS> now his plans were fully made , and this is what he intended to do . <EOS>	55.61090981809207
<SOS> if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body , dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him , but with a sudden cut of the knife , he meant to open the sack from top to bottom , and , profiting by their alarm , escape ; if they tried to catch him , he would use his knife to better purpose . <EOS>	67.70418505414945
<SOS> < num > m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave , he would allow himself to be covered with earth , and then , as it was night , the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped . <EOS>	62.955505420805274
<SOS> he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it . <EOS>	107.42086011040466
<SOS> if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy , he would be stifled , and then so much the better , all would be over . <EOS>	97.58833511251058
<SOS> dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening , but he had not thought of hunger , nor did he think of it now . <EOS>	104.29360511268061
<SOS> his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one . <EOS>	95.22566235636809
<SOS> the first risk that dantès ran was , that the jailer , when he brought him his supper at seven o'clock , might perceive the change that had been made ; fortunately , twenty times at least , from misanthropy or fatigue , dantès had received his jailer in bed , and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table , and went away without saying a word . <EOS>	45.67844931780258
<SOS> this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual , but speak to dantès , and seeing that he received no reply , go to the bed , and thus discover all . <EOS>	76.15639597498468
<SOS> when seven o'clock came , dantès ' agony really began . <EOS>	42.38140891068075
<SOS> his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings , while , with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples . <EOS>	83.02911441308348
<SOS> from time to time chills ran through his whole body , and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice . <EOS>	74.99423586115256
<SOS> then he thought he was going to die . <EOS>	101.28320555415709
<SOS> yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance , and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril . <EOS>	113.71315289454192
<SOS> it was a good augury . <EOS>	87.29153265048068
<SOS> at length , about the hour the governor had appointed , footsteps were heard on the stairs . <EOS>	46.423511744985504
<SOS> edmond felt that the moment had arrived , summoned up all his courage , held his breath , and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins . <EOS>	72.88173267890349
<SOS> the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty , when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier . <EOS>	74.83930650613868
<SOS> the door opened , and a dim light reached dantès ' eyes through the coarse sack that covered him ; he saw two shadows approach his bed , a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand . <EOS>	95.79107954595244
<SOS> the two men , approaching the ends of the bed , took the sack by its extremities . <EOS>	101.00242249268533
<SOS> `` he 's heavy , though , for an old and thin man , '' said one , as he raised the head . <EOS>	118.16113423560726
<SOS> `` they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones , '' said another , lifting the feet . <EOS>	76.78140500387431
<SOS> `` have you tied the knot ? '' <EOS>	84.48493851839542
<SOS> inquired the first speaker . <EOS>	102.29861777936534
<SOS> `` what would be the use of carrying so much more weight ? '' <EOS>	72.22342297754818
<SOS> was the reply , `` i can do that when we get there . '' <EOS>	97.5375997744722
<SOS> `` yes , you 're right , '' replied the companion . <EOS>	80.14100914529749
<SOS> `` what 's the knot for ? '' <EOS>	65.52007719748181
<SOS> thought dantès . <EOS>	50.376083570225056
<SOS> they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier . <EOS>	75.1983824480817
<SOS> edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man , and then the party , lighted by the man with the torch , who went first , ascended the stairs . <EOS>	95.37973288236398
<SOS> suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air , and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing . <EOS>	59.656729220433526
<SOS> it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled . <EOS>	102.40174283432705
<SOS> the bearers went on for twenty paces , then stopped , putting the bier down on the ground . <EOS>	81.19703645615003
<SOS> one of them went away , and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement . <EOS>	108.37324547633095
<SOS> `` where am i ? '' <EOS>	68.31794442473142
<SOS> he asked himself . <EOS>	97.30947508105614
<SOS> `` really , he is by no means a light load ! '' <EOS>	103.90400459259313
<SOS> said the other bearer , sitting on the edge of the hand barrow . <EOS>	91.17380325565064
<SOS> dantès ' first impulse was to escape , but fortunately he did not attempt it . <EOS>	99.26555200725659
<SOS> `` give us a light , '' said the other bearer , `` or i shall never find what i am looking for . '' <EOS>	69.3702710054543
<SOS> the man with the torch complied , although not asked in the most polite terms . <EOS>	64.53717197319176
<SOS> `` what can he be looking for ? '' <EOS>	85.13890562125465
<SOS> thought edmond . <EOS>	64.14345720945148
<SOS> `` the spade , perhaps . '' <EOS>	73.16818548467596
<SOS> an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search . <EOS>	94.58926657047891
<SOS> `` here it is at last , '' he said , `` not without some trouble , though . '' <EOS>	89.00182474515366
<SOS> `` yes , '' was the answer , `` but it has lost nothing by waiting . '' <EOS>	71.88997545484506
<SOS> as he said this , the man came towards edmond , who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him , and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence . <EOS>	65.33666453985333
<SOS> `` well , have you tied the knot ? '' <EOS>	89.03345592455153
<SOS> inquired the grave digger , who was looking on . <EOS>	72.70263248836977
<SOS> `` yes , and pretty tight too , i can tell you , '' was the answer . <EOS>	91.06767405564206
<SOS> `` move on , then . '' <EOS>	72.43402118583546
<SOS> and the bier was lifted once more , and they proceeded . <EOS>	65.99567655453305
<SOS> they advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again . <EOS>	77.17936355584179
<SOS> the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built , reached dantès ' ear distinctly as they went forward . <EOS>	87.79937574959958
<SOS> `` bad weather ! '' <EOS>	72.30619478554101
<SOS> observed one of the bearers ; `` not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea . '' <EOS>	51.373495440292515
<SOS> `` why , yes , the abbé runs a chance of being wet , '' said the other ; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter . <EOS>	69.00487785323709
<SOS> dantès did not comprehend the jest , but his hair stood erect on his head . <EOS>	60.66254744315197
<SOS> `` well , here we are at last , '' said one of them . <EOS>	117.37873834390807
<SOS> `` a little farther a little farther , '' said the other . <EOS>	89.90072931150517
<SOS> `` you know very well that the last was stopped on his way , dashed on the rocks , and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows . '' <EOS>	66.25534875151997
<SOS> they ascended five or six more steps , and then dantès felt that they took him , one by the head and the other by the heels , and swung him to and fro . <EOS>	79.36851570822951
<SOS> `` one ! '' <EOS>	83.97011328822035
<SOS> said the grave diggers , `` two ! <EOS>	74.38875856135628
<SOS> three ! '' <EOS>	71.8369996447636
<SOS> and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird , falling , falling , with a rapidity that made his blood curdle . <EOS>	72.66102117874976
<SOS> although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent , it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century . <EOS>	69.3336618814443
<SOS> at last , with a horrible splash , he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water , and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry , stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves . <EOS>	84.81563668510317
<SOS> dantès had been flung into the sea , and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet . <EOS>	53.084662596411796
<SOS> the sea is the cemetery of the château d'if . <EOS>	102.17216559140807
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	87.99395694792646
<SOS> the island of tiboulen dantès , although stunned and almost suffocated , had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath , and as his right hand ( prepared as he was for every chance ) held his knife open , he rapidly ripped up the sack , extricated his arm , and then his body ; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot , he felt it dragging him down still lower . <EOS>	55.31038911310422
<SOS> he then bent his body , and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs , at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled . <EOS>	101.65369057390583
<SOS> with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea , while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud . <EOS>	66.67838557686854
<SOS> dantès waited only to get breath , and then dived , in order to avoid being seen . <EOS>	70.15549194012283
<SOS> when he arose a second time , he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk . <EOS>	100.69477086574199
<SOS> he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky , across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear ; before him was the vast expanse of waters , sombre and terrible , whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm . <EOS>	63.61252190867476
<SOS> behind him , blacker than the sea , blacker than the sky , rose phantom like the vast stone structure , whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey , and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures . <EOS>	98.81422814524247
<SOS> he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea ; doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry . <EOS>	84.92887095666968
<SOS> dantès dived again , and remained a long time beneath the water . <EOS>	69.47121192450194
<SOS> this was an easy feat to him , for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there , and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port . <EOS>	54.052400294937954
<SOS> when he came up again the light had disappeared . <EOS>	77.20797236939045
<SOS> he must now get his bearings . <EOS>	56.30735260413254
<SOS> ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château d'if , but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited , as is also the islet of daume . <EOS>	81.53736330950568
<SOS> tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès ' venture . <EOS>	64.09279077926374
<SOS> the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d'if ; dantès , nevertheless , determined to make for them . <EOS>	76.8467435506787
<SOS> but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night ? <EOS>	55.49902509350555
<SOS> at this moment he saw the light of planier , gleaming in front of him like a star . <EOS>	78.49770188240325
<SOS> by leaving this light on the right , he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left ; by turning to the left , therefore , he would find it . <EOS>	58.36249717753313
<SOS> but , as we have said , it was at least a league from the château d'if to this island . <EOS>	54.09096672025027
<SOS> often in prison faria had said to him , when he saw him idle and inactive : `` dantès , you must not give way to this listlessness ; you will be drowned if you seek to escape , and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion . '' <EOS>	61.97371944504663
<SOS> these words rang in dantès ' ears , even beneath the waves ; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength . <EOS>	97.64183078687607
<SOS> he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power , and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy . <EOS>	50.13527498715958
<SOS> fear , that relentless pursuer , clogged dantès ' efforts . <EOS>	92.50419731967071
<SOS> he listened for any sound that might be audible , and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon , and strove to penetrate the darkness . <EOS>	69.75515434427207
<SOS> he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat , and he redoubled his exertions , increasing rapidly his distance from the château , but exhausting his strength . <EOS>	61.70554511305009
<SOS> he swam on still , and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness . <EOS>	62.24197242491131
<SOS> he could not see it , but he felt its presence . <EOS>	113.61607868003482
<SOS> an hour passed , during which dantès , excited by the feeling of freedom , continued to cleave the waves . <EOS>	60.063868666568936
<SOS> `` let us see , '' said he , `` i have swum above an hour , but as the wind is against me , that has retarded my speed ; however , if i am not mistaken , i must be close to tiboulen . <EOS>	69.58162365216457
<SOS> but what if i were mistaken ? '' <EOS>	66.79924859317977
<SOS> a shudder passed over him . <EOS>	83.49980057458187
<SOS> he sought to tread water , in order to rest himself ; but the sea was too violent , and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation . <EOS>	69.9116499348981
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , `` i will swim on until i am worn out , or the cramp seizes me , and then i shall sink ; '' and he struck out with the energy of despair . <EOS>	52.96296176783931
<SOS> suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense , and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him ; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee . <EOS>	71.23945761379633
<SOS> he fancied for a moment that he had been shot , and listened for the report ; but he heard nothing . <EOS>	64.69353422762747
<SOS> then he put out his hand , and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore . <EOS>	61.261781005277726
<SOS> before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks , that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion . <EOS>	90.23898522472577
<SOS> it was the island of tiboulen . <EOS>	80.43856250867782
<SOS> dantès rose , advanced a few steps , and , with a fervent prayer of gratitude , stretched himself on the granite , which seemed to him softer than down . <EOS>	59.096622088821825
<SOS> then , in spite of the wind and rain , he fell into the deep , sweet sleep of utter exhaustion . <EOS>	48.21312358873966
<SOS> at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder . <EOS>	84.90341523488966
<SOS> the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings ; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent , lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves . <EOS>	89.52356590614589
<SOS> dantès had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands , which was , in fact , tiboulen . <EOS>	65.6670135289627
<SOS> he knew that it was barren and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to plunge into its waves again , and swim to lemaire , equally arid , but larger , and consequently better adapted for concealment . <EOS>	79.85358003605633
<SOS> an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter , and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury . <EOS>	95.06193031597942
<SOS> edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay ; the waves , dashing themselves against it , wetted him with their spray . <EOS>	49.77881397394444
<SOS> he was safely sheltered , and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning . <EOS>	49.1842154634498
<SOS> it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base , and that it would , like a vessel at anchor , break moorings , and bear him off into the centre of the storm . <EOS>	111.86409996376563
<SOS> he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours . <EOS>	70.27267459739654
<SOS> he extended his hands , and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock . <EOS>	102.45005238868332
<SOS> as he rose , a flash of lightning , that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven , illumined the darkness . <EOS>	49.66036428705488
<SOS> by its light , between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle , a quarter of a league distant , dantès saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves . <EOS>	81.74359588807361
<SOS> a second after , he saw it again , approaching with frightful rapidity . <EOS>	108.36053369308326
<SOS> dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger , but they saw it themselves . <EOS>	115.71675958645552
<SOS> another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging , while a fifth clung to the broken rudder . <EOS>	66.52525696910872
<SOS> the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly , for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind . <EOS>	98.86001479899151
<SOS> above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving ; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way , and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird . <EOS>	108.28766361667361
<SOS> at the same moment a violent crash was heard , and cries of distress . <EOS>	107.3806106923815
<SOS> dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel , and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors . <EOS>	85.54997534595356
<SOS> then all was dark again . <EOS>	104.63237583006737
<SOS> dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces ; he listened , he groped about , but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased , and the tempest continued to rage . <EOS>	106.03391531550848
<SOS> by degrees the wind abated , vast gray clouds rolled towards the west , and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars . <EOS>	57.67900661486744
<SOS> soon a red streak became visible in the horizon , the waves whitened , a light played over them , and gilded their foaming crests with gold . <EOS>	62.463571724350345
<SOS> it was day . <EOS>	89.09718739933648
<SOS> dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle , as if he now beheld it for the first time ; and indeed since his captivity in the château d'if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed . <EOS>	101.83031279798674
<SOS> he turned towards the fortress , and looked at both sea and land . <EOS>	56.94327132376233
<SOS> the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene . <EOS>	87.72268146125415
<SOS> it was about five o'clock . <EOS>	65.79245491092618
<SOS> the sea continued to get calmer . <EOS>	100.39852466485087
<SOS> `` in two or three hours , '' thought dantès , `` the turnkey will enter my chamber , find the body of my poor friend , recognize it , seek for me in vain , and give the alarm . <EOS>	65.05620758049005
<SOS> then the tunnel will be discovered ; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered , will be questioned . <EOS>	84.28425926187973
<SOS> then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive . <EOS>	87.48766047180648
<SOS> the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished . <EOS>	72.57014266546149
<SOS> the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land , whilst the governor pursues me by sea . <EOS>	62.215355817447204
<SOS> i am cold , i am hungry . <EOS>	63.644633988329396
<SOS> i have lost even the knife that saved me . <EOS>	90.27686275979822
<SOS> oh , my god , i have suffered enough surely ! <EOS>	57.530734517277104
<SOS> have pity on me , and do for me what i am unable to do for myself . '' <EOS>	61.672638991822346
<SOS> as dantès ( his eyes turned in the direction of the château d'if ) uttered this prayer , he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey ; and with his sailor 's eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan . <EOS>	106.36603945226624
<SOS> she was coming out of marseilles harbor , and was standing out to sea rapidly , her sharp prow cleaving through the waves . <EOS>	51.57674637965397
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried edmond , `` to think that in half an hour i could join her , did i not fear being questioned , detected , and conveyed back to marseilles ! <EOS>	59.4590687642403
<SOS> what can i do ? <EOS>	55.62691218670366
<SOS> what story can i invent ? <EOS>	118.78696541374902
<SOS> under pretext of trading along the coast , these men , who are in reality smugglers , will prefer selling me to doing a good action . <EOS>	86.75819464648464
<SOS> i must wait . <EOS>	60.21250520962615
<SOS> but i can not i am starving . <EOS>	53.649351956694176
<SOS> in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted ; besides , perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress . <EOS>	99.77876090493453
<SOS> i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night . <EOS>	48.75868064216621
<SOS> my story will be accepted , for there is no one left to contradict me . '' <EOS>	87.80094058839343
<SOS> as he spoke , dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked , and started . <EOS>	75.2321236656131
<SOS> the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel 's keel , floated at the foot of the crag . <EOS>	96.61924653641793
<SOS> in an instant dantès ' plan was formed . <EOS>	74.61543173461152
<SOS> he swam to the cap , placed it on his head , seized one of the timbers , and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking . <EOS>	119.18534359700598
<SOS> `` i am saved ! '' <EOS>	115.36008266416361
<SOS> murmured he . <EOS>	63.98474564722856
<SOS> and this conviction restored his strength . <EOS>	57.80820572783579
<SOS> he soon saw that the vessel , with the wind dead ahead , was tacking between the château d'if and the tower of planier . <EOS>	76.74736016258547
<SOS> for an instant he feared lest , instead of keeping in shore , she should stand out to sea ; but he soon saw that she would pass , like most vessels bound for italy , between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne . <EOS>	90.71524413862836
<SOS> however , the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another , and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him . <EOS>	61.0457495017632
<SOS> he rose on the waves , making signs of distress ; but no one on board saw him , and the vessel stood on another tack . <EOS>	71.53828302019254
<SOS> dantès would have shouted , but he knew that the wind would drown his voice . <EOS>	65.33621291247835
<SOS> it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber , for without it he would have been unable , perhaps , to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore , should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention . <EOS>	104.02356242651253
<SOS> dantès , though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take , had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him . <EOS>	84.13934506430775
<SOS> then he advanced ; but before they could meet , the vessel again changed her course . <EOS>	61.78844110602963
<SOS> by a violent effort he rose half out of the water , waving his cap , and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors . <EOS>	70.24978855628657
<SOS> this time he was both seen and heard , and the tartan instantly steered towards him . <EOS>	45.06790558170219
<SOS> at the same time , he saw they were about to lower the boat . <EOS>	76.25028471999845
<SOS> an instant after , the boat , rowed by two men , advanced rapidly towards him . <EOS>	84.70440844117248
<SOS> dantès let go of the timber , which he now thought to be useless , and swam vigorously to meet them . <EOS>	84.83288965516759
<SOS> but he had reckoned too much upon his strength , and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him . <EOS>	77.25955041605553
<SOS> his arms became stiff , his legs lost their flexibility , and he was almost breathless . <EOS>	76.61265260251369
<SOS> he shouted again . <EOS>	43.819612063806154
<SOS> the two sailors redoubled their efforts , and one of them cried in italian , `` courage ! '' <EOS>	61.615881056341635
<SOS> the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head . <EOS>	76.14954932228518
<SOS> he rose again to the surface , struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man , uttered a third cry , and felt himself sinking , as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet . <EOS>	41.299483968005454
<SOS> the water passed over his head , and the sky turned gray . <EOS>	92.39080608230195
<SOS> a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface . <EOS>	78.95961011544077
<SOS> he felt himself seized by the hair , then he saw and heard nothing . <EOS>	65.45273383283539
<SOS> he had fainted . <EOS>	69.37589832049403
<SOS> when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan . <EOS>	59.2368725895394
<SOS> his first care was to see what course they were taking . <EOS>	74.39184709010176
<SOS> they were rapidly leaving the château d'if behind . <EOS>	91.92487041683776
<SOS> dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh . <EOS>	85.62158094345672
<SOS> as we have said , he was lying on the deck . <EOS>	72.35324714101606
<SOS> a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth ; another , whom he recognized as the one who had cried out `` courage ! '' <EOS>	66.70142249343246
<SOS> held a gourd full of rum to his mouth ; while the third , an old sailor , at once the pilot and captain , looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday , and which may overtake them tomorrow . <EOS>	95.43791894835906
<SOS> a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation , while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity . <EOS>	102.37862953314166
<SOS> `` who are you ? '' <EOS>	93.3810263573075
<SOS> said the pilot in bad french . <EOS>	91.97312117689856
<SOS> `` i am , '' replied dantès , in bad italian , `` a maltese sailor . <EOS>	70.30837245705635
<SOS> we were coming from syracuse laden with grain . <EOS>	60.65678833365164
<SOS> the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou , and we were wrecked on these rocks . '' <EOS>	66.3154215727692
<SOS> `` where do you come from ? '' <EOS>	69.06254717289906
<SOS> `` from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost . <EOS>	42.871230534478514
<SOS> i saw your vessel , and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island , i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course . <EOS>	50.95939764018768
<SOS> you have saved my life , and i thank you , '' continued dantès . <EOS>	91.65617054775878
<SOS> `` i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair . '' <EOS>	56.284686446684496
<SOS> `` it was i , '' said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance ; `` and it was time , for you were sinking . '' <EOS>	82.556469647832
<SOS> `` yes , '' returned dantès , holding out his hand , `` i thank you again . '' <EOS>	81.0137752842281
<SOS> `` i almost hesitated , though , '' replied the sailor ; `` you looked more like a brigand than an honest man , with your beard six inches , and your hair a foot long . '' <EOS>	49.47393431938374
<SOS> dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the château d'if . <EOS>	107.6543095257334
<SOS> `` yes , '' said he , `` i made a vow , to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger ; but today the vow expires . '' <EOS>	52.3514368580833
<SOS> `` now what are we to do with you ? '' <EOS>	82.80596628591357
<SOS> said the captain . <EOS>	85.6430120136457
<SOS> `` alas , anything you please . <EOS>	60.091349837687126
<SOS> my captain is dead ; i have barely escaped ; but i am a good sailor . <EOS>	76.84637476365306
<SOS> leave me at the first port you make ; i shall be sure to find employment . '' <EOS>	117.68129914228025
<SOS> `` do you know the mediterranean ? '' <EOS>	77.84107797733131
<SOS> `` i have sailed over it since my childhood . '' <EOS>	67.33112295259359
<SOS> `` you know the best harbors ? '' <EOS>	68.45727569727937
<SOS> `` there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes . '' <EOS>	95.92766606571283
<SOS> `` i say , captain , '' said the sailor who had cried `` courage ! '' <EOS>	57.485673814680204
<SOS> to dantès , `` if what he says is true , what hinders his staying with us ? '' <EOS>	53.79626183744344
<SOS> `` if he says true , '' said the captain doubtingly . <EOS>	92.7446612240131
<SOS> `` but in his present condition he will promise anything , and take his chance of keeping it afterwards . '' <EOS>	75.07990010240069
<SOS> `` i will do more than i promise , '' said dantès . <EOS>	82.45122303661046
<SOS> `` we shall see , '' returned the other , smiling . <EOS>	56.71488694497584
<SOS> `` where are you going ? '' <EOS>	98.47892966485419
<SOS> asked dantès . <EOS>	56.13224429798893
<SOS> `` to leghorn . '' <EOS>	79.07159898469797
<SOS> `` then why , instead of tacking so frequently , do you not sail nearer the wind ? '' <EOS>	88.45202694298239
<SOS> `` because we should run straight on to the island of rion . '' <EOS>	83.25933463026797
<SOS> `` you shall pass it by twenty fathoms . '' <EOS>	88.21302085439473
<SOS> `` take the helm , and let us see what you know . '' <EOS>	59.21132147509326
<SOS> the young man took the helm , felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that , without being a first rate sailor , she yet was tolerably obedient . <EOS>	85.6035862791525
<SOS> `` to the sheets , '' said he . <EOS>	54.398819417692216
<SOS> the four seamen , who composed the crew , obeyed , while the pilot looked on . <EOS>	50.76508173371958
<SOS> `` haul taut . '' <EOS>	64.69351248983854
<SOS> they obeyed . <EOS>	69.65024985847232
<SOS> `` belay . '' <EOS>	68.55164107210095
<SOS> this order was also executed ; and the vessel passed , as dantès had predicted , twenty fathoms to windward . <EOS>	61.815481802701946
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	58.268680285881366
<SOS> said the captain . <EOS>	52.745328293820336
<SOS> `` bravo ! '' <EOS>	78.6315127243861
<SOS> repeated the sailors . <EOS>	79.62760386933941
<SOS> and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing . <EOS>	68.37454220783192
<SOS> `` you see , '' said dantès , quitting the helm , `` i shall be of some use to you , at least during the voyage . <EOS>	93.53203604946854
<SOS> if you do not want me at leghorn , you can leave me there , and i will pay you out of the first wages i get , for my food and the clothes you lend me . '' <EOS>	48.00086572971182
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the captain , `` we can agree very well , if you are reasonable . '' <EOS>	74.05330371298926
<SOS> `` give me what you give the others , and it will be all right , '' returned dantès . <EOS>	57.88910481010222
<SOS> `` that 's not fair , '' said the seaman who had saved dantès ; `` for you know more than we do . '' <EOS>	55.43654381526043
<SOS> `` what is that to you , jacopo ? '' <EOS>	74.9624679713011
<SOS> returned the captain . <EOS>	56.593448678614365
<SOS> `` everyone is free to ask what he pleases . '' <EOS>	102.35758294350288
<SOS> `` that 's true , '' replied jacopo ; `` i only make a remark . '' <EOS>	67.25441633392849
<SOS> `` well , you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers , if you have them . '' <EOS>	85.74399778523508
<SOS> `` no , '' said jacopo ; `` but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers . '' <EOS>	79.54134141923502
<SOS> `` that is all i want , '' interrupted dantès . <EOS>	77.01681949546284
<SOS> jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted . <EOS>	81.4431311217201
<SOS> `` now , then , do you wish for anything else ? '' <EOS>	84.08122429030368
<SOS> said the patron . <EOS>	46.03476817800932
<SOS> `` a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted , for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time . '' <EOS>	51.249596800749416
<SOS> he had not tasted food for forty hours . <EOS>	73.47283547906724
<SOS> a piece of bread was brought , and jacopo offered him the gourd . <EOS>	65.19841346179378
<SOS> `` larboard your helm , '' cried the captain to the steersman . <EOS>	62.18151952011346
<SOS> dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth ; then paused with hand in mid air . <EOS>	68.32450349321842
<SOS> `` hollo ! <EOS>	70.08664026434855
<SOS> what 's the matter at the château d'if ? '' <EOS>	107.62935652808144
<SOS> said the captain . <EOS>	75.21823787812677
<SOS> a small white cloud , which had attracted dantès ' attention , crowned the summit of the bastion of the château d'if . <EOS>	84.03409361672897
<SOS> at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard . <EOS>	74.63381356793671
<SOS> the sailors looked at one another . <EOS>	107.7207497304362
<SOS> `` what is this ? '' <EOS>	58.32807538867267
<SOS> asked the captain . <EOS>	53.699165318854824
<SOS> `` a prisoner has escaped from the château d'if , and they are firing the alarm gun , '' replied dantès . <EOS>	70.05993946578751
<SOS> the captain glanced at him , but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure , that suspicions , if the captain had any , died away . <EOS>	103.951302793186
<SOS> < num > m `` pretty strong rum ! '' <EOS>	60.70562440431439
<SOS> said dantès , wiping his brow with his sleeve . <EOS>	88.42897085968161
<SOS> `` at any rate , '' murmured he , `` if it be , so much the better , for i have made a rare acquisition . '' <EOS>	63.13380047281518
<SOS> < num > m under pretence of being fatigued , dantès asked to take the helm ; the steersman , glad to be relieved , looked at the captain , and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade . <EOS>	61.805107520616154
<SOS> dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles . <EOS>	72.28611582308012
<SOS> `` what is the day of the month ? '' <EOS>	98.11660326783161
<SOS> asked he of jacopo , who sat down beside him . <EOS>	64.38045681711105
<SOS> `` the < num > th of february . '' <EOS>	65.76664843031924
<SOS> `` in what year ? '' <EOS>	55.837079676467766
<SOS> `` in what year you ask me in what year ? '' <EOS>	56.00510402107742
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the young man , `` i ask you in what year ! '' <EOS>	74.4346868633054
<SOS> `` you have forgotten then ? '' <EOS>	76.75293058600218
<SOS> `` i got such a fright last night , '' replied dantès , smiling , `` that i have almost lost my memory . <EOS>	82.87673649792335
<SOS> i ask you what year is it ? '' <EOS>	86.53644694449629
<SOS> `` the year < num > , '' returned jacopo . <EOS>	64.75453363181664
<SOS> it was fourteen years , day for day , since dantès ' arrest . <EOS>	66.80453745156755
<SOS> he was nineteen when he entered the château d'if ; he was thirty three when he escaped . <EOS>	67.3208727227991
<SOS> a sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of mercédès , who must believe him dead . <EOS>	52.76539405576604
<SOS> then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity . <EOS>	51.094319035236545
<SOS> he renewed against danglars , fernand , and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon . <EOS>	62.980087029812736
<SOS> this oath was no longer a vain menace ; for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan , that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn . <EOS>	55.98010785617198
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	97.7948829844672
<SOS> the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast . <EOS>	108.93264056234487
<SOS> without having been in the school of the abbé faria , the worthy master of la jeune amélie ( the name of the genoese tartan ) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean , from the arabic to the provençal , and this , while it spared him interpreters , persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet , gave him great facilities of communication , either with the vessels he met at sea , with the small boats sailing along the coast , or with the people without name , country , or occupation , who are always seen on the quays of seaports , and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence , as they have no visible means of support . <EOS>	78.16594112828545
<SOS> it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler . <EOS>	56.977988297834536
<SOS> at first the captain had received dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust . <EOS>	73.95745801977841
<SOS> he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast ; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits , he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties , who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade . <EOS>	70.24172977903834
<SOS> but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him ; and then , when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d'if , and heard the distant report , he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going , like that of kings , was accompanied with salutes of artillery . <EOS>	107.74115111562544
<SOS> this made him less uneasy , it must be owned , than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer ; but this supposition also disappeared like the first , when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit . <EOS>	88.87816371925207
<SOS> edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was , without the owner knowing who he was ; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to `` pump '' him , they extracted nothing more from him ; he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta , which he knew as well as marseilles , and held stoutly to his first story . <EOS>	76.65995699153007
<SOS> thus the genoese , subtle as he was , was duped by edmond , in whose favor his mild demeanor , his nautical skill , and his admirable dissimulation , pleaded . <EOS>	71.18626087366545
<SOS> moreover , it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know , and believe nothing but what they should believe . <EOS>	83.0165317408827
<SOS> in this state of mutual understanding , they reached leghorn . <EOS>	43.19434544106623
<SOS> here edmond was to undergo another trial ; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself , as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years . <EOS>	84.01559161778692
<SOS> he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been , and was now to find out what the man had become . <EOS>	70.16027451461736
<SOS> his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled . <EOS>	92.28218888106656
<SOS> as he had twenty times touched at leghorn , he remembered a barber in st. ferdinand street ; he went there to have his beard and hair cut . <EOS>	95.22670511165875
<SOS> the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long , thick and black hair and beard , which gave his head the appearance of one of titian 's portraits . <EOS>	46.773696966181575
<SOS> at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long ; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them . <EOS>	49.98908572002145
<SOS> the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work . <EOS>	86.58456709593457
<SOS> when the operation was concluded , and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth , and his hair reduced to its usual length , he asked for a looking glass . <EOS>	77.25150846269479
<SOS> he was now , as we have said , three and thirty years of age , and his fourteen years ' imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance . <EOS>	74.43360784777519
<SOS> dantès had entered the château d'if with the round , open , smiling face of a young and happy man , with whom the early paths of life have been smooth , and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past . <EOS>	101.966067768242
<SOS> this was now all changed . <EOS>	80.51941309347343
<SOS> the oval face was lengthened , his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution ; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought ; his eyes were full of melancholy , and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred ; his complexion , so long kept from the sun , had now that pale color which produces , when the features are encircled with black hair , the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north ; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression ; and he had also acquired , being naturally of a goodly stature , that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself . <EOS>	82.78004814774684
<SOS> < num > m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure . <EOS>	62.82649889261417
<SOS> as to his voice , prayers , sobs , and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness , and at others rough and almost hoarse . <EOS>	55.24117507821186
<SOS> moreover , from being so long in twilight or darkness , his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night , common to the hyena and the wolf . <EOS>	54.15048438325077
<SOS> edmond smiled when he beheld himself ; it was impossible that his best friend if , indeed , he had any friend left could recognize him ; he could not recognize himself . <EOS>	65.95404966632988
<SOS> the master of la jeune amélie , who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond 's value , had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits , which edmond had accepted . <EOS>	76.74753421869316
<SOS> his next care on leaving the barber 's who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor 's suit a garb , as we all know , very simple , and consisting of white trousers , a striped shirt , and a cap . <EOS>	54.56016920697592
<SOS> it was in this costume , and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him , that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger , who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him , or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard , hair tangled with seaweed , and body soaking in seabrine , whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned . <EOS>	55.343618465743084
<SOS> attracted by his prepossessing appearance , he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès ; but dantès , who had his own projects , would not agree for a longer time than three months . <EOS>	45.0289654295257
<SOS> la jeune amélie had a very active crew , very obedient to their captain , who lost as little time as possible . <EOS>	97.15812914028808
<SOS> he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins , contraband cottons , english powder , and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark . <EOS>	85.5361567652271
<SOS> the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties , and land it on the shores of corsica , where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france . <EOS>	84.53993185857863
<SOS> they sailed ; edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth , and which he had so often dreamed of in prison . <EOS>	64.33825946684206
<SOS> he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left , and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon . <EOS>	49.237529074798836
<SOS> the next morning going on deck , as he always did at an early hour , the patron found dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks , which the rising sun tinged with rosy light . <EOS>	87.50184862792824
<SOS> it was the island of monte cristo . <EOS>	81.00104277255113
<SOS> la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica . <EOS>	60.96439649847996
<SOS> dantès thought , as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him , that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land . <EOS>	49.17860675213486
<SOS> but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure , without arms to defend himself ? <EOS>	58.82902493712931
<SOS> besides , what would the sailors say ? <EOS>	82.36260962645585
<SOS> what would the patron think ? <EOS>	54.49668208959864
<SOS> he must wait . <EOS>	64.3978063171562
<SOS> fortunately , dantès had learned how to wait ; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty , and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth . <EOS>	68.27807958287164
<SOS> would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him ? <EOS>	90.98300199071053
<SOS> besides , were not those riches chimerical ? <EOS>	80.6794600027441
<SOS> offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria , had they not died with him ? <EOS>	115.79666328657787
<SOS> it is true , the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial , and dantès repeated it to himself , from one end to the other , for he had not forgotten a word . <EOS>	117.24849982113156
<SOS> < num > m evening came , and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight , and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own , for he , with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison , continued to behold it last of all , for he remained alone upon deck . <EOS>	67.194047863745
<SOS> the next morn broke off the coast of aleria ; all day they coasted , and in the evening saw fires lighted on land ; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing , for a ship 's lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer , and they came to within a gunshot of the shore . <EOS>	76.63314398680883
<SOS> dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had , as he neared the land , mounted two small culverins , which , without making much noise , can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so . <EOS>	78.28433498761392
<SOS> but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous , and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness . <EOS>	61.754876035560045
<SOS> four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger , which , no doubt , in acknowledgement of the compliment , lowered her own shallop into the sea , and the five boats worked so well that by two o'clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amélie and on terra firma . <EOS>	95.0442270602531
<SOS> the same night , such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie , the profits were divided , and each man had a hundred tuscan livres , or about eighty francs . <EOS>	111.3563979272508
<SOS> but the voyage was not ended . <EOS>	83.40985660451383
<SOS> they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia , where they intended to take in a cargo , which was to replace what had been discharged . <EOS>	92.42369230851344
<SOS> the second operation was as successful as the first , la jeune amélie was in luck . <EOS>	79.09091897744756
<SOS> this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca , and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars , sherry , and malaga wines . <EOS>	67.32755212121168
<SOS> there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties ; the excise was , in truth , the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amélie . <EOS>	63.736151217689304
<SOS> a customs officer was laid low , and two sailors wounded ; dantès was one of the latter , a ball having touched him in the left shoulder . <EOS>	82.30109640165796
<SOS> dantès was almost glad of this affray , and almost pleased at being wounded , for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger , and with what endurance he could bear suffering . <EOS>	101.92347086979458
<SOS> he had contemplated danger with a smile , and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher , `` pain , thou art not an evil . '' <EOS>	73.50021252266126
<SOS> he had , moreover , looked upon the customs officer wounded to death , and , whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter , or the chill of human sentiment , this sight had made but slight impression upon him . <EOS>	94.21786837478413
<SOS> dantès was on the way he desired to follow , and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve ; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom . <EOS>	56.10058306352191
<SOS> jacopo , seeing him fall , had believed him killed , and rushing towards him raised him up , and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade . <EOS>	66.62735512458731
<SOS> this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it , neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it , since this man , who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money , manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall . <EOS>	90.77678542955651
<SOS> fortunately , as we have said , edmond was only wounded , and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons , and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women , the wound soon closed . <EOS>	72.3496001952568
<SOS> edmond then resolved to try jacopo , and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money , but jacopo refused it indignantly . <EOS>	70.168798316905
<SOS> as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond , the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection . <EOS>	42.510503705983034
<SOS> but this sufficed for jacopo , who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others . <EOS>	76.4986748999885
<SOS> and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman . <EOS>	62.04210137382443
<SOS> then in the long days on board ship , when the vessel , gliding on with security over the azure sea , required no care but the hand of the helmsman , thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails , edmond , with a chart in his hand , became the instructor of jacopo , as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor . <EOS>	87.04265292942124
<SOS> he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast , explained to him the variations of the compass , and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven , and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds . <EOS>	87.83555859432676
<SOS> and when jacopo inquired of him , `` what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me ? '' <EOS>	80.51127534427009
<SOS> edmond replied , `` who knows ? <EOS>	75.0549266102705
<SOS> you may one day be the captain of a vessel . <EOS>	67.89943478392856
<SOS> your fellow countryman , bonaparte , became emperor . '' <EOS>	62.46140931210894
<SOS> we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican . <EOS>	83.33924784973931
<SOS> two months and a half elapsed in these trips , and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman ; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast , and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other . <EOS>	111.73148427747213
<SOS> he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times , but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there . <EOS>	87.65554484476375
<SOS> he then formed a resolution . <EOS>	105.16744417369448
<SOS> as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amélie ended , he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo . <EOS>	121.06926821397323
<SOS> then he would be free to make his researches , not perhaps entirely at liberty , for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him . <EOS>	74.84067143563902
<SOS> but in this world we must risk something . <EOS>	87.45305957403305
<SOS> prison had made edmond prudent , and he was desirous of running no risk whatever . <EOS>	66.7684048975186
<SOS> but in vain did he rack his imagination ; fertile as it was , he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship . <EOS>	78.53449056747237
<SOS> dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes , when the patron , who had great confidence in him , and was very desirous of retaining him in his service , took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del ' oglio , where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade . <EOS>	96.80709429316296
<SOS> already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times , and seeing all these hardy free traders , who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent , he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds . <EOS>	55.82188412048211
<SOS> this time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets , stuffs of the levant , and cashmeres . <EOS>	51.94415509463131
<SOS> it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made , and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france . <EOS>	55.70610346512993
<SOS> if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous , there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew . <EOS>	92.86386813079724
<SOS> the patron of la jeune amélie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo , which being completely deserted , and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers , seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury , the god of merchants and robbers , classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct , but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category . <EOS>	53.89167254136437
<SOS> at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy ; he rose to conceal his emotion , and took a turn around the smoky tavern , where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca . <EOS>	69.07354535470186
<SOS> when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter , it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night . <EOS>	57.907416892776254
<SOS> edmond , being consulted , was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security , and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly . <EOS>	58.939540160771955
<SOS> nothing then was altered in the plan , and orders were given to get under weigh next night , and , wind and weather permitting , to make the neutral island by the following day . <EOS>	89.59586643616541
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	92.23187227231658
<SOS> the island of monte cristo thus , at length , by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny , dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for , by simple and natural means , and land on the island without incurring any suspicion . <EOS>	71.63958611653028
<SOS> one night more and he would be on his way . <EOS>	64.30931013632956
<SOS> the night was one of feverish distraction , and in its progress visions , good and evil , passed through dantès ' mind . <EOS>	82.22610588469271
<SOS> if he closed his eyes , he saw cardinal spada 's letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain . <EOS>	92.35328872902406
<SOS> he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds , with panels of rubies , and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites . <EOS>	79.68014044838321
<SOS> pearls fell drop by drop , as subterranean waters filter in their caves . <EOS>	88.64477940592097
<SOS> edmond , amazed , wonderstruck , filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight , when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles . <EOS>	76.02050340683104
<SOS> he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos , but they had suddenly receded , and now the path became a labyrinth , and then the entrance vanished , and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman . <EOS>	52.10713421606779
<SOS> all was useless , the treasure disappeared , and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off . <EOS>	98.70550370537528
<SOS> the day came at length , and was almost as feverish as the night had been , but it brought reason to the aid of imagination , and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain . <EOS>	72.22054540101189
<SOS> night came , and with it the preparation for departure , and these preparations served to conceal dantès ' agitation . <EOS>	80.6378420801167
<SOS> he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board ; and as his orders were always clear , distinct , and easy of execution , his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure . <EOS>	55.42641944753192
<SOS> the old patron did not interfere , for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself . <EOS>	75.4030686563964
<SOS> he saw in the young man his natural successor , and regretted that he had not a daughter , that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance . <EOS>	70.16343944195776
<SOS> at seven o'clock in the evening all was ready , and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled . <EOS>	49.658694785383
<SOS> the sea was calm , and , with a fresh breeze from the south east , they sailed beneath a bright blue sky , in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights , each of which is a world . <EOS>	46.12411343747434
<SOS> dantès told them that all hands might turn in , and he would take the helm . <EOS>	85.65009815587936
<SOS> when the maltese ( for so they called dantès ) had said this , it was sufficient , and all went to their bunks contentedly . <EOS>	55.22503381260367
<SOS> this frequently happened . <EOS>	107.21069195001346
<SOS> dantès , cast from solitude into the world , frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude ; and what solitude is more complete , or more poetical , than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night , in the silence of immensity , and under the eye of heaven ? <EOS>	81.1073898242895
<SOS> now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts , the night lighted up by his illusions , and the silence animated by his anticipations . <EOS>	75.6638819687767
<SOS> when the patron awoke , the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set , and every sail full with the breeze . <EOS>	52.26944575814222
<SOS> they were making nearly ten knots an hour . <EOS>	83.68392733893965
<SOS> the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon . <EOS>	48.26797288551722
<SOS> edmond resigned the lugger to the master 's care , and went and lay down in his hammock ; but , in spite of a sleepless night , he could not close his eyes for a moment . <EOS>	51.889956456968385
<SOS> two hours afterwards he came on deck , as the boat was about to double the island of elba . <EOS>	68.85570099011532
<SOS> they were just abreast of mareciana , and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa . <EOS>	42.38149970453771
<SOS> the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun , was seen against the azure sky . <EOS>	72.53231213427635
<SOS> dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm , in order to leave la pianosa to starboard , as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots . <EOS>	98.48449741756832
<SOS> about five o'clock in the evening the island was distinct , and everything on it was plainly perceptible , owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting . <EOS>	59.8145775302213
<SOS> edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors , from the brightest pink to the deepest blue ; and from time to time his cheeks flushed , his brow darkened , and a mist passed over his eyes . <EOS>	104.98791966429862
<SOS> never did a gamester , whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die , experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope . <EOS>	73.54867474953572
<SOS> night came , and at ten o'clock they anchored . <EOS>	48.01382688291323
<SOS> la jeune amélie was first at the rendezvous . <EOS>	67.29612098038236
<SOS> in spite of his usual command over himself , dantès could not restrain his impetuosity . <EOS>	80.96553646820706
<SOS> he was the first to jump on shore ; and had he dared , he would , like lucius brutus , have `` kissed his mother earth . '' <EOS>	77.42058351998041
<SOS> it was dark , but at eleven o'clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean , whose every wave she silvered , and then , `` ascending high , '' played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion . <EOS>	77.40596630825256
<SOS> the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amélie , it was one of her regular haunts . <EOS>	90.32200022729893
<SOS> as to dantès , he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant , but never touched at it . <EOS>	66.98536754639134
<SOS> he questioned jacopo . <EOS>	108.77434800108834
<SOS> `` where shall we pass the night ? '' <EOS>	97.90108480467758
<SOS> he inquired . <EOS>	69.71905193278393
<SOS> `` why , on board the tartan , '' replied the sailor . <EOS>	91.82351713504232
<SOS> `` should we not do better in the grottos ? '' <EOS>	77.59133325398501
<SOS> `` what grottos ? '' <EOS>	110.18278979952984
<SOS> `` why , the grottos caves of the island . '' <EOS>	46.74058028644886
<SOS> `` i do not know of any grottos , '' replied jacopo . <EOS>	52.789442543911555
<SOS> the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès ' brow . <EOS>	65.75909483461615
<SOS> `` what , are there no grottos at monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	53.64046590314033
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	49.46045527805066
<SOS> `` none . '' <EOS>	101.66482862333852
<SOS> for a moment dantès was speechless ; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident , or even stopped up , for the sake of greater security , by cardinal spada . <EOS>	72.36384995076558
<SOS> the point was , then , to discover the hidden entrance . <EOS>	71.35950219406017
<SOS> it was useless to search at night , and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning . <EOS>	55.88936581516326
<SOS> besides , a signal made half a league out at sea , and to which la jeune amélie replied by a similar signal , indicated that the moment for business had come . <EOS>	84.45971743668515
<SOS> the boat that now arrived , assured by the answering signal that all was well , soon came in sight , white and silent as a phantom , and cast anchor within a cable 's length of shore . <EOS>	67.86368303839002
<SOS> then the landing began . <EOS>	46.754801404014714
<SOS> dantès reflected , as he worked , on the shout of joy which , with a single word , he could evoke from all these men , if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart ; but , far from disclosing this precious secret , he almost feared that he had already said too much , and by his restlessness and continual questions , his minute observations and evident preoccupation , aroused suspicions . <EOS>	71.61258301394625
<SOS> fortunately , as regarded this circumstance at least , his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness , and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory . <EOS>	97.77303927948795
<SOS> no one had the slightest suspicion ; and when next day , taking a fowling piece , powder , and shot , dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock , his wish was construed into a love of sport , or a desire for solitude . <EOS>	102.5568087878827
<SOS> however , jacopo insisted on following him , and dantès did not oppose this , fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust . <EOS>	68.97271229373885
<SOS> scarcely , however , had they gone a quarter of a league when , having killed a kid , he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades , and request them to cook it , and when ready to let him know by firing a gun . <EOS>	74.5039816508435
<SOS> this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano , was the bill of fare . <EOS>	53.880106152177426
<SOS> dantès went on , looking from time to time behind and around about him . <EOS>	66.19288743122068
<SOS> having reached the summit of a rock , he saw , a thousand feet beneath him , his companions , whom jacopo had rejoined , and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond 's skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish . <EOS>	53.83147627468958
<SOS> edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows . <EOS>	49.50865765497055
<SOS> `` in two hours ' time , '' said he , `` these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each , to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more ; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs , and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs . <EOS>	80.26684650227092
<SOS> at this moment hope makes me despise their riches , which seem to me contemptible . <EOS>	65.76731600511015
<SOS> yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me , that i shall , on compulsion , consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness . <EOS>	85.9363624172635
<SOS> oh , no ! '' <EOS>	65.27467716492431
<SOS> exclaimed edmond , `` that will not be . <EOS>	75.02589826806856
<SOS> the wise , unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing . <EOS>	77.10520486292691
<SOS> besides , it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life . '' <EOS>	59.890374586685894
<SOS> thus dantès , who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough , and panted for wealth . <EOS>	89.7515347879413
<SOS> the cause was not in dantès , but in providence , who , while limiting the power of man , has filled him with boundless desires . <EOS>	80.45471293050316
<SOS> meanwhile , by a cleft between two walls of rock , following a path worn by a torrent , and which , in all human probability , human foot had never before trod , dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed . <EOS>	64.20041292679032
<SOS> keeping along the shore , and examining the smallest object with serious attention , he thought he could trace , on certain rocks , marks made by the hand of man . <EOS>	86.17915133493578
<SOS> time , which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle , as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness , seemed to have respected these signs , which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity , and probably with a definite purpose . <EOS>	69.8836416369674
<SOS> occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle , which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms , or beneath parasitical lichen . <EOS>	80.20683287882862
<SOS> so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were . <EOS>	88.32707199947599
<SOS> the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes . <EOS>	62.63451263920067
<SOS> might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them , in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe , which he could not foresee would have been so complete . <EOS>	68.5178308784554
<SOS> this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure . <EOS>	64.64879528305362
<SOS> only , might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made ? <EOS>	65.85277552506328
<SOS> and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret ? <EOS>	55.454635566687
<SOS> < num > m it seemed , however , to edmond , who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground , that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased ; nor did they terminate at any grotto . <EOS>	77.7344970067074
<SOS> a large round rock , placed solidly on its base , was the only spot to which they seemed to lead . <EOS>	77.7386012858628
<SOS> edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning , and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps . <EOS>	59.63084437835012
<SOS> meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast , had got some water from a spring , spread out the fruit and bread , and cooked the kid . <EOS>	62.837792441652546
<SOS> just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit , they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock , and they fired the signal agreed upon . <EOS>	63.75569951247066
<SOS> the sportsman instantly changed his direction , and ran quickly towards them . <EOS>	77.07482344521034
<SOS> but even while they watched his daring progress , edmond 's foot slipped , and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear . <EOS>	86.63979551685215
<SOS> they all rushed towards him , for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority ; yet jacopo reached him first . <EOS>	96.1609820442901
<SOS> he found edmond lying prone , bleeding , and almost senseless . <EOS>	89.62785576124358
<SOS> he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet . <EOS>	57.18534760235651
<SOS> they poured a little rum down his throat , and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him , produced the same effect as formerly . <EOS>	58.32078045504136
<SOS> edmond opened his eyes , complained of great pain in his knee , a feeling of heaviness in his head , and severe pains in his loins . <EOS>	84.15249558181237
<SOS> they wished to carry him to the shore ; but when they touched him , although under jacopo 's directions , he declared , with heavy groans , that he could not bear to be moved . <EOS>	73.2980766970887
<SOS> it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner , but he insisted that his comrades , who had not his reasons for fasting , should have their meal . <EOS>	60.56360569200213
<SOS> as for himself , he declared that he had only need of a little rest , and that when they returned he should be easier . <EOS>	102.1957324263247
<SOS> the sailors did not require much urging . <EOS>	79.2221014988383
<SOS> they were hungry , and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory , and your tars are not very ceremonious . <EOS>	90.93337297026545
<SOS> an hour afterwards they returned . <EOS>	76.64913961941743
<SOS> all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock . <EOS>	87.23949310364924
<SOS> but , instead of growing easier , dantès ' pains appeared to increase in violence . <EOS>	97.00298161984595
<SOS> the old patron , who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france , between nice and fréjus , urged dantès to try and rise . <EOS>	75.55155468483169
<SOS> edmond made great exertions in order to comply ; but at each effort he fell back , moaning and turning pale . <EOS>	86.02297674146884
<SOS> `` he has broken his ribs , '' said the commander , in a low voice . <EOS>	44.295516923064
<SOS> `` no matter ; he is an excellent fellow , and we must not leave him . <EOS>	82.50066157899595
<SOS> we will try and carry him on board the tartan . '' <EOS>	86.5554656430068
<SOS> dantès declared , however , that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him . <EOS>	69.62014892455811
<SOS> `` well , '' said the patron , `` let what may happen , it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you . <EOS>	45.26185511762174
<SOS> we will not go till evening . '' <EOS>	76.95892992944437
<SOS> this very much astonished the sailors , although , not one opposed it . <EOS>	91.08734340258569
<SOS> the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution . <EOS>	77.17714033273947
<SOS> dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor . <EOS>	90.14256597268346
<SOS> `` no , no , '' he said to the patron , `` i was awkward , and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness . <EOS>	72.23455422420658
<SOS> leave me a small supply of biscuit , a gun , powder , and balls , to kill the kids or defend myself at need , and a pickaxe , that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me . '' <EOS>	85.78793988942822
<SOS> `` but you 'll die of hunger , '' said the patron . <EOS>	110.3102972989208
<SOS> `` i would rather do so , '' was edmond 's reply , `` than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me . '' <EOS>	62.12940136463852
<SOS> the patron turned towards his vessel , which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor , and , with sails partly set , would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed . <EOS>	58.818503903055934
<SOS> `` what are we to do , maltese ? '' <EOS>	102.02280984472667
<SOS> asked the captain . <EOS>	92.24704633884065
<SOS> `` we can not leave you here so , and yet we can not stay . '' <EOS>	93.8463205089691
<SOS> `` go , go ! '' <EOS>	73.31872968975487
<SOS> exclaimed dantès . <EOS>	67.02224937931543
<SOS> `` we shall be absent at least a week , '' said the patron , `` and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again . '' <EOS>	52.73601820684732
<SOS> `` why , '' said dantès , `` if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat , desire them to come here to me . <EOS>	53.94600079291593
<SOS> i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn . <EOS>	58.97066530578563
<SOS> if you do not come across one , return for me . '' <EOS>	81.69061472415078
<SOS> the patron shook his head . <EOS>	104.02872168333293
<SOS> `` listen , captain baldi ; there 's one way of settling this , '' said jacopo . <EOS>	100.4497574107088
<SOS> `` do you go , and i will stay and take care of the wounded man . '' <EOS>	77.44090043311266
<SOS> `` and give up your share of the venture , '' said edmond , `` to remain with me ? '' <EOS>	97.6357100904163
<SOS> `` yes , '' said jacopo , `` and without any hesitation . '' <EOS>	40.67026905882299
<SOS> `` you are a good fellow and a kind hearted messmate , '' replied edmond , `` and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions ; but i do not wish anyone to stay with me . <EOS>	93.98322521554606
<SOS> a day or two of rest will set me up , and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises . '' <EOS>	97.20024416050926
<SOS> a peculiar smile passed over dantès ' lips ; he squeezed jacopo 's hand warmly , but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone . <EOS>	94.43988722876712
<SOS> the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail , but not without turning about several times , and each time making signs of a cordial farewell , to which edmond replied with his hand only , as if he could not move the rest of his body . <EOS>	44.532746931982956
<SOS> then , when they had disappeared , he said with a smile , `` 't is strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion . '' <EOS>	91.7436765086497
<SOS> then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock , from which he had a full view of the sea , and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing , weigh anchor , and , balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing , set sail . <EOS>	73.26897589140184
<SOS> at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight ; at least , it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was . <EOS>	42.97013958342915
<SOS> then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks , took his gun in one hand , his pickaxe in the other , and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated . <EOS>	93.97435089545704
<SOS> `` and now , '' he exclaimed , remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman , which faria had related to him , `` now , open sesame ! '' <EOS>	67.75878278808533
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	83.09051458971165
<SOS> the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian , and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks , which seemed themselves sensible of the heat . <EOS>	60.49147535733273
<SOS> thousands of grasshoppers , hidden in the bushes , chirped with a monotonous and dull note ; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind . <EOS>	98.98266632023699
<SOS> at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald ; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag . <EOS>	75.80282786516679
<SOS> in a word , the island was inhabited , yet edmond felt himself alone , guided by the hand of god . <EOS>	67.51717737625886
<SOS> he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed . <EOS>	73.8352524277991
<SOS> this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor , he stopped , laid down his pickaxe , seized his gun , mounted to the summit of the highest rock , and from thence gazed round in every direction . <EOS>	97.12724210642885
<SOS> but it was not upon corsica , the very houses of which he could distinguish ; or on sardinia ; or on the island of elba , with its historical associations ; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud , and leghorn the commercial , that he gazed . <EOS>	68.03456127817522
<SOS> it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning , and the tartan that had just set sail , that edmond fixed his eyes . <EOS>	65.20797220285858
<SOS> the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio ; the other , following an opposite direction , was about to round the island of corsica . <EOS>	43.172111097024654
<SOS> this sight reassured him . <EOS>	107.12551651168674
<SOS> he then looked at the objects near him . <EOS>	72.22963896970178
<SOS> he saw that he was on the highest point of the island , a statue on this vast pedestal of granite , nothing human appearing in sight , while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island , and covered it with a fringe of foam . <EOS>	99.6650733602625
<SOS> then he descended with cautious and slow step , for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality . <EOS>	73.0780994930057
<SOS> dantès , as we have said , had traced the marks along the rocks , and he had noticed that they led to a small creek , which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph . <EOS>	82.5760732527707
<SOS> this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth , and deep in the centre , to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class , which would be perfectly concealed from observation . <EOS>	59.42771433753203
<SOS> then following the clew that , in the hands of the abbé faria , had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities , he thought that the cardinal spada , anxious not to be watched , had entered the creek , concealed his little barque , followed the line marked by the notches in the rock , and at the end of it had buried his treasure . <EOS>	82.42896100865639
<SOS> it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock . <EOS>	103.27692802876882
<SOS> one thing only perplexed edmond , and destroyed his theory . <EOS>	63.564657512484054
<SOS> how could this rock , which weighed several tons , have been lifted to this spot , without the aid of many men ? <EOS>	104.33153341889613
<SOS> suddenly an idea flashed across his mind . <EOS>	87.75321483890353
<SOS> instead of raising it , thought he , they have lowered it . <EOS>	57.206245758709585
<SOS> and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood . <EOS>	74.77750683136524
<SOS> he soon perceived that a slope had been formed , and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied . <EOS>	89.53762275458652
<SOS> a large stone had served as a wedge ; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it , so as to conceal the orifice ; this species of masonry had been covered with earth , and grass and weeds had grown there , moss had clung to the stones , myrtle bushes had taken root , and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth . <EOS>	81.585118043969
<SOS> < num > m dantès dug away the earth carefully , and detected , or fancied he detected , the ingenious artifice . <EOS>	58.45900572207904
<SOS> he attacked this wall , cemented by the hand of time , with his pickaxe . <EOS>	108.59885189562232
<SOS> after ten minutes ' labor the wall gave way , and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened . <EOS>	53.049008655163874
<SOS> dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find , stripped off its branches , inserted it in the hole , and used it as a lever . <EOS>	97.53637736803688
<SOS> but the rock was too heavy , and too firmly wedged , to be moved by anyone man , were he hercules himself . <EOS>	50.98457535852595
<SOS> dantès saw that he must attack the wedge . <EOS>	63.800790399249244
<SOS> but how ? <EOS>	104.24575567658493
<SOS> he cast his eyes around , and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him . <EOS>	99.70622870981325
<SOS> he smiled ; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose . <EOS>	72.358474189786
<SOS> with the aid of his pickaxe , dantès , after the manner of a labor saving pioneer , dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it , filled it with powder , then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre . <EOS>	63.551160754466615
<SOS> he lighted it and retired . <EOS>	43.30861038628406
<SOS> the explosion soon followed ; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder ; the lower one flew into pieces ; thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed , and a huge snake , like the guardian demon of the treasure , rolled himself along in darkening coils , and disappeared . <EOS>	100.6246323997099
<SOS> dantès approached the upper rock , which now , without any support , leaned towards the sea . <EOS>	42.228990944219596
<SOS> the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it , and , selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack , placed his lever in one of the crevices , and strained every nerve to move the mass . <EOS>	81.57766227795427
<SOS> the rock , already shaken by the explosion , tottered on its base . <EOS>	54.671491621405444
<SOS> dantès redoubled his efforts ; he seemed like one of the ancient titans , who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods . <EOS>	88.2015466679259
<SOS> the rock yielded , rolled over , bounded from point to point , and finally disappeared in the ocean . <EOS>	90.2975793858952
<SOS> on the spot it had occupied was a circular space , exposing an iron ring let into a square flag stone . <EOS>	85.87114201596877
<SOS> dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise ; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success . <EOS>	81.58229549771444
<SOS> he would fain have continued , but his knees trembled , and his heart beat so violently , and his sight became so dim , that he was forced to pause . <EOS>	95.61671665935191
<SOS> this feeling lasted but for a moment . <EOS>	40.85365539238701
<SOS> edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength ; the flag stone yielded , and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto . <EOS>	75.8775183511504
<SOS> anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy . <EOS>	94.11317682382023
<SOS> dantès turned pale , hesitated , and reflected . <EOS>	58.11762387525085
<SOS> `` come , '' said he to himself , `` be a man . <EOS>	92.55116268909052
<SOS> i am accustomed to adversity . <EOS>	115.01461382028742
<SOS> i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived . <EOS>	96.3723163046932
<SOS> what , then , would be the use of all i have suffered ? <EOS>	75.21250358519823
<SOS> the heart breaks when , after having been elated by flattering hopes , it sees all its illusions destroyed . <EOS>	104.9314896971161
<SOS> faria has dreamed this ; the cardinal spada buried no treasure here ; perhaps he never came here , or if he did , cæsar borgia , the intrepid adventurer , the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer , has followed him , discovered his traces , pursued them as i have done , raised the stone , and descending before me , has left me nothing . '' <EOS>	107.37519042835838
<SOS> he remained motionless and pensive , his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet . <EOS>	68.61393542171044
<SOS> `` now that i expect nothing , now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes , the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity . '' <EOS>	75.67986205798265
<SOS> and he remained again motionless and thoughtful . <EOS>	106.95814396004512
<SOS> `` yes , yes ; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit . <EOS>	51.59410591743096
<SOS> this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels . <EOS>	46.78652350786322
<SOS> yes , borgia has been here , a torch in one hand , a sword in the other , and within twenty paces , at the foot of this rock , perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea , while their master descended , as i am about to descend , dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress . '' <EOS>	87.37640517804076
<SOS> < num > m `` but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret ? '' <EOS>	103.89721951897916
<SOS> asked dantès of himself . <EOS>	89.36988333752419
<SOS> `` the fate , '' replied he , smiling , `` of those who buried alaric , and were interred with the corpse . '' <EOS>	74.064276090102
<SOS> `` yet , had he come , '' thought dantès , `` he would have found the treasure , and borgia , he who compared italy to an artichoke , which he could devour leaf by leaf , knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock . <EOS>	62.082921446671016
<SOS> i will go down . '' <EOS>	96.64526462525357
<SOS> then he descended , a smile on his lips , and murmuring that last word of human philosophy , `` perhaps ! '' <EOS>	43.64734295687256
<SOS> but instead of the darkness , and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find , dantès saw a dim and bluish light , which , as well as the air , entered , not merely by the aperture he had just formed , but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without , and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks , and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks . <EOS>	38.88947554972335
<SOS> after having stood a few minutes in the cavern , the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp , dantès ' eye , habituated as it was to darkness , could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern , which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds . <EOS>	85.505474823319
<SOS> `` alas , '' said edmond , smiling , `` these are the treasures the cardinal has left ; and the good abbé , seeing in a dream these glittering walls , has indulged in fallacious hopes . '' <EOS>	73.78517941845077
<SOS> but he called to mind the words of the will , which he knew by heart . <EOS>	54.506528793580664
<SOS> `` in the farthest angle of the second opening , '' said the cardinal 's will . <EOS>	64.48003682138679
<SOS> he had only found the first grotto ; he had now to seek the second . <EOS>	71.47230996660205
<SOS> dantès continued his search . <EOS>	95.2943877766538
<SOS> he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island ; he examined the stones , and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed , masked for precaution 's sake . <EOS>	52.18563292808097
<SOS> the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès ' forehead large drops of perspiration . <EOS>	71.98623415196086
<SOS> at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo ; he eagerly advanced , and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses , saw that there , in all probability , the opening must be . <EOS>	106.93169271823753
<SOS> however , he , like cæsar borgia , knew the value of time ; and , in order to avoid fruitless toil , he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe , struck the earth with the butt of his gun , and finding nothing that appeared suspicious , returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard . <EOS>	80.46046086186834
<SOS> he again struck it , and with greater force . <EOS>	118.01243669490891
<SOS> then a singular thing occurred . <EOS>	94.97526135950166
<SOS> as he struck the wall , pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off , and fell to the ground in flakes , exposing a large white stone . <EOS>	78.46413205209238
<SOS> the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones , then this stucco had been applied , and painted to imitate granite . <EOS>	95.55645837825257
<SOS> dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe , which entered someway between the interstices . <EOS>	104.15893595047432
<SOS> it was there he must dig . <EOS>	49.449428271559945
<SOS> but by some strange play of emotion , in proportion as the proofs that faria , had not been deceived became stronger , so did his heart give way , and a feeling of discouragement stole over him . <EOS>	110.46071912271763
<SOS> this last proof , instead of giving him fresh strength , deprived him of it ; the pickaxe descended , or rather fell ; he placed it on the ground , passed his hand over his brow , and remounted the stairs , alleging to himself , as an excuse , a desire to be assured that no one was watching him , but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint . <EOS>	72.74242043106342
<SOS> the island was deserted , and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance ; afar off , a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean . <EOS>	77.20218898308273
<SOS> dantès had tasted nothing , but he thought not of hunger at such a moment ; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum , and again entered the cavern . <EOS>	77.51028256712053
<SOS> the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy , was now like a feather in his grasp ; he seized it , and attacked the wall . <EOS>	58.405314474042854
<SOS> after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented , but had been merely placed one upon the other , and covered with stucco ; he inserted the point of his pickaxe , and using the handle as a lever , with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges , and fall at his feet . <EOS>	79.42219168526536
<SOS> he had nothing more to do now , but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one . <EOS>	43.971451879344635
<SOS> the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter , but by waiting , he could still cling to hope , and retard the certainty of deception . <EOS>	83.67543277613221
<SOS> at last , after renewed hesitation , dantès entered the second grotto . <EOS>	76.36369450062493
<SOS> the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first ; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern . <EOS>	104.91578796363505
<SOS> he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere , and then went on . <EOS>	71.90273156077704
<SOS> at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle . <EOS>	81.42109120961258
<SOS> but to dantès ' eye there was no darkness . <EOS>	115.90415664254334
<SOS> he glanced around this second grotto ; it was , like the first , empty . <EOS>	93.21122549469058
<SOS> the treasure , if it existed , was buried in this corner . <EOS>	70.92575395869045
<SOS> the time had at length arrived ; two feet of earth removed , and dantès ' fate would be decided . <EOS>	52.38431653615193
<SOS> he advanced towards the angle , and summoning all his resolution , attacked the ground with the pickaxe . <EOS>	79.84031528206893
<SOS> at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance . <EOS>	91.45148448794754
<SOS> never did funeral knell , never did alarm bell , produce a greater effect on the hearer . <EOS>	41.939753176439126
<SOS> had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale . <EOS>	77.66184947409246
<SOS> he again struck his pickaxe into the earth , and encountered the same resistance , but not the same sound . <EOS>	43.89734243561295
<SOS> `` it is a casket of wood bound with iron , '' thought he . <EOS>	70.51213918073253
<SOS> at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening ; dantès seized his gun , sprang through the opening , and mounted the stair . <EOS>	60.17493274979577
<SOS> a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave , and was feeding at a little distance . <EOS>	93.56068038607361
<SOS> this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner ; but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention . <EOS>	58.59816364365241
<SOS> he thought a moment , cut a branch of a resinous tree , lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast , and descended with this torch . <EOS>	102.46402112718994
<SOS> he wished to see everything . <EOS>	75.03365363770988
<SOS> he approached the hole he had dug , and now , with the aid of the torch , saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood . <EOS>	66.34944547903768
<SOS> he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor . <EOS>	83.36204433186113
<SOS> in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared , and dantès could see an oaken coffer , bound with cut steel ; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate , which was still untarnished , the arms of the spada family viz. , a sword , en pale , on an oval shield , like all the italian armorial bearings , and surmounted by a cardinal 's hat . <EOS>	47.208567711916494
<SOS> dantès easily recognized them , faria had so often drawn them for him . <EOS>	47.62263703257526
<SOS> there was no longer any doubt : the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket . <EOS>	46.29166564850987
<SOS> in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away , and he saw successively the lock , placed between two padlocks , and the two handles at each end , all carved as things were carved at that epoch , when art rendered the commonest metals precious . <EOS>	66.40324751924572
<SOS> dantès seized the handles , and strove to lift the coffer ; it was impossible . <EOS>	112.2678039404463
<SOS> he sought to open it ; lock and padlock were fastened ; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust . <EOS>	50.168419644633246
<SOS> dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid , and pressing with all his force on the handle , burst open the fastenings . <EOS>	74.79396032671539
<SOS> the hinges yielded in their turn and fell , still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood , and the chest was open . <EOS>	57.516320968561786
<SOS> < num > m edmond was seized with vertigo ; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him . <EOS>	77.69547308263509
<SOS> he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament ; then he re opened them , and stood motionless with amazement . <EOS>	102.51258753265337
<SOS> three compartments divided the coffer . <EOS>	83.17338691052741
<SOS> in the first , blazed piles of golden coin ; in the second , were ranged bars of unpolished gold , which possessed nothing attractive save their value ; in the third , edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds , pearls , and rubies , which , as they fell on one another , sounded like hail against glass . <EOS>	104.07276428166212
<SOS> after having touched , felt , examined these treasures , edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy ; he leaped on a rock , from whence he could behold the sea . <EOS>	77.31892896609205
<SOS> he was alone alone with these countless , these unheard of treasures ! <EOS>	52.86713116787697
<SOS> was he awake , or was it but a dream ? <EOS>	61.61044018207023
<SOS> was it a transient vision , or was he face to face with reality ? <EOS>	42.881052130320946
<SOS> he would fain have gazed upon his gold , and yet he had not strength enough ; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him , and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo , terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures ; then he returned , and , still unable to believe the evidence of his senses , rushed into the grotto , and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels . <EOS>	59.63569526860972
<SOS> this time he fell on his knees , and , clasping his hands convulsively , uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone . <EOS>	100.78335766590988
<SOS> he soon became calmer and more happy , for only now did he begin to realize his felicity . <EOS>	75.39876525279288
<SOS> he then set himself to work to count his fortune . <EOS>	87.12289010074586
<SOS> there were a thousand ingots of gold , each weighing from two to three pounds ; then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns , each worth about eighty francs of our money , and bearing the effigies of alexander vi . <EOS>	104.31228272109804
<SOS> and his predecessors ; and he saw that the complement was not half empty . <EOS>	68.92357617721026
<SOS> and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls , diamonds , and other gems , many of which , mounted by the most famous workmen , were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth . <EOS>	79.8032897537756
<SOS> dantès saw the light gradually disappear , and fearing to be surprised in the cavern , left it , his gun in his hand . <EOS>	71.62953385062949
<SOS> a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper , and he snatched a few hours ' sleep , lying over the mouth of the cave . <EOS>	101.97775137325458
<SOS> it was a night of joy and terror , such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime . <EOS>	77.59641113328875
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	72.363349873198
<SOS> the unknown day , for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes , again dawned . <EOS>	70.91469751326234
<SOS> with the first light dantès resumed his search . <EOS>	85.72690485935307
<SOS> again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening , and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape ; but it wore the same wild , barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve . <EOS>	83.6842093176827
<SOS> descending into the grotto , he lifted the stone , filled his pockets with gems , put the box together as well and securely as he could , sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken , and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance ; then , quitting the grotto , he replaced the stone , heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite , filling the interstices with earth , into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants , such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn , then carefully watering these new plantations , he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps , leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it . <EOS>	68.26059509482333
<SOS> this done , he impatiently awaited the return of his companions . <EOS>	84.76699166763484
<SOS> to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart , which yearned to return to dwell among mankind , and to assume the rank , power , and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man . <EOS>	73.94858330665744
<SOS> on the sixth day , the smugglers returned . <EOS>	55.62979662275655
<SOS> from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of la jeune amélie , and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place , he met his companions with an assurance that , although considerably better than when they quitted him , he still suffered acutely from his late accident . <EOS>	48.6112444259585
<SOS> he then inquired how they had fared in their trip . <EOS>	76.39576435085094
<SOS> to this question the smugglers replied that , although successful in landing their cargo in safety , they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them . <EOS>	107.17349835843719
<SOS> this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy , when they could but lament the absence of dantès , whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially . <EOS>	61.17644950329852
<SOS> in fact , the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when , fortunately , night came on , and enabled them to double the cape of corsica , and so elude all further pursuit . <EOS>	79.74312608814463
<SOS> upon the whole , however , the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned ; while the crew , and particularly jacopo , expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits , which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each . <EOS>	106.44325932843567
<SOS> < num > m edmond preserved the most admirable self command , not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island ; but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away , he embarked that same evening , and proceeded with the captain to leghorn . <EOS>	75.77644751514863
<SOS> arrived at leghorn , he repaired to the house of a jew , a dealer in precious stones , to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each . <EOS>	68.82089383115824
<SOS> dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion ; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent . <EOS>	91.13490238289647
<SOS> the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel , accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres , that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit , upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès , residing in the allées de meilhan , and also a young woman called mercédès , an inhabitant of the catalan village . <EOS>	79.5693917748345
<SOS> jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present , which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family , who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend ; but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune , left him by an uncle , whose sole heir he was . <EOS>	94.89275921624017
<SOS> the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy . <EOS>	65.76685468058673
<SOS> the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amélie having expired , dantès took leave of the captain , who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew , but having been told the history of the legacy , he ceased to importune him further . <EOS>	116.19292590625938
<SOS> the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles , with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo . <EOS>	86.55055734367244
<SOS> having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor , dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amélie , distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all , and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him . <EOS>	59.449386171942095
<SOS> to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans . <EOS>	60.26725794649983
<SOS> then dantès departed for genoa . <EOS>	97.05211166170801
<SOS> at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay ; this yacht had been built by order of an englishman , who , having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels , was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill ; the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs . <EOS>	51.815958872693194
<SOS> dantès , struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel , applied to its owner to transfer it to him , offering sixty thousand francs , upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession . <EOS>	88.01729184257607
<SOS> the proposal was too advantageous to be refused , the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland , and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month , by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another . <EOS>	60.554307857787464
<SOS> a bargain was therefore struck . <EOS>	91.31574694623822
<SOS> dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew ; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor , and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces . <EOS>	96.9066338026292
<SOS> the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel , but this dantès declined with many thanks , saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone , and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself ; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed 's head , the closet to contain three divisions , so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself . <EOS>	52.01608404087295
<SOS> the builder cheerfully undertook the commission , and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day , dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed . <EOS>	48.51085970428331
<SOS> < num > m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa , under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht . <EOS>	43.030179105456334
<SOS> but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm . <EOS>	107.21794990104127
<SOS> the boat , indeed , seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence , so promptly did it obey the slightest touch ; and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding . <EOS>	81.7921081140622
<SOS> the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible ; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination . <EOS>	92.48493813590964
<SOS> some insisted she was making for corsica , others the island of elba ; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain ; while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course ; but no one thought of monte cristo . <EOS>	70.47093433343156
<SOS> yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel , and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day ; his boat had proved herself a first class sailor , and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours . <EOS>	75.42351015546866
<SOS> dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore , and , instead of landing at the usual place , he dropped anchor in the little creek . <EOS>	101.64219992227028
<SOS> the island was utterly deserted , and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away ; his treasure was just as he had left it . <EOS>	62.751227473668486
<SOS> early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches , and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker . <EOS>	51.38371799802038
<SOS> a week passed by . <EOS>	49.08636669806488
<SOS> dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island , studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service , till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities . <EOS>	54.94943429722032
<SOS> the former dantès proposed to augment , the latter to remedy . <EOS>	74.59743623265054
<SOS> upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo . <EOS>	52.80547929099576
<SOS> as it drew near , he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo . <EOS>	75.81686099280715
<SOS> he immediately signalled it . <EOS>	81.28948633302956
<SOS> his signal was returned , and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht . <EOS>	92.17779577992208
<SOS> a mournful answer awaited each of edmond 's eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained . <EOS>	107.24888001340693
<SOS> old dantès was dead , and mercédès had disappeared . <EOS>	66.30863709608896
<SOS> dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness ; but , leaping lightly ashore , he signified his desire to be quite alone . <EOS>	89.64027998098668
<SOS> in a couple of hours he returned . <EOS>	90.69760785482215
<SOS> two of the men from jacopo 's boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it , and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles . <EOS>	79.47318437239281
<SOS> for his father 's death he was in some manner prepared ; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès . <EOS>	85.86268554253009
<SOS> without divulging his secret , dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent . <EOS>	76.28888907447075
<SOS> there were , besides , other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining , and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself . <EOS>	60.93673489176822
<SOS> his looking glass had assured him , during his stay at leghorn , that he ran no risk of recognition ; moreover , he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper . <EOS>	87.06959270599253
<SOS> one fine morning , then , his yacht , followed by the little fishing boat , boldly entered the port of marseilles , and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence , on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d'if , he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither . <EOS>	47.02274345221543
<SOS> < num > m still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore ; but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria , dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn , and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded , he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation . <EOS>	49.33031888967139
<SOS> the first person to attract the attention of dantès , as he landed on the canebière , was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon . <EOS>	76.54052079869018
<SOS> edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance . <EOS>	76.7571703000131
<SOS> going straight towards him , he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects , carefully watching the man 's countenance as he did so ; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing . <EOS>	60.41776022906243
<SOS> giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility , dantès proceeded onwards ; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop . <EOS>	66.97237078091953
<SOS> dantès instantly turned to meet him . <EOS>	62.772393394598424
<SOS> `` i beg your pardon , sir , '' said the honest fellow , in almost breathless haste , `` but i believe you made a mistake ; you intended to give me a two franc piece , and see , you gave me a double napoleon . '' <EOS>	61.00477164800381
<SOS> `` thank you , my good friend . <EOS>	66.8479435509788
<SOS> i see that i have made a trifling mistake , as you say ; but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon , that you may drink to my health , and be able to ask your messmates to join you . '' <EOS>	85.65461993446955
<SOS> so extreme was the surprise of the sailor , that he was unable even to thank edmond , whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment . <EOS>	63.596317890740984
<SOS> `` some nabob from india , '' was his comment . <EOS>	50.55012224177841
<SOS> dantès , meanwhile , went on his way . <EOS>	66.88033353152537
<SOS> each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion ; his first and most indelible recollections were there ; not a tree , not a street , that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories . <EOS>	72.9499542908991
<SOS> and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles , from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained . <EOS>	88.10554836839789
<SOS> at this spot , so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances , his heart beat almost to bursting , his knees tottered under him , a mist floated over his sight , and had he not clung for support to one of the trees , he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there . <EOS>	68.3407143813978
<SOS> recovering himself , however , he wiped the perspiration from his brows , and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived . <EOS>	93.37235219546129
<SOS> the nasturtiums and other plants , which his father had delighted to train before his window , had all disappeared from the upper part of the house . <EOS>	58.77933930696057
<SOS> leaning against the tree , he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house . <EOS>	84.90043079198976
<SOS> then he advanced to the door , and asked whether there were any rooms to be let . <EOS>	70.28423888239622
<SOS> though answered in the negative , he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor , that , in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied , dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants , and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them . <EOS>	46.01318115453595
<SOS> the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week ; and seeing them , dantès sighed heavily . <EOS>	80.14850774087986
<SOS> nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès ; the very paper was different , while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond 's time had all disappeared ; the four walls alone remained as he had left them . <EOS>	84.53110363532049
<SOS> the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his ; and , in spite of his efforts to prevent it , the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last , vainly calling for his son . <EOS>	84.5506792439045
<SOS> the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor 's emotion , and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features ; but they felt the sacredness of his grief , and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause , while , with instinctive delicacy , they left him to indulge his sorrow alone . <EOS>	67.34169294734261
<SOS> < num > m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections , they both accompanied him downstairs , reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased , and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him . <EOS>	53.821495993607584
<SOS> as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor , he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there ; but he received for reply , that the person in question had got into difficulties , and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire . <EOS>	56.174603490782495
<SOS> having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged , dantès next proceeded thither , and , under the name of lord wilmore ( the name and title inscribed on his passport ) , purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs , at least ten thousand more than it was worth ; but had its owner asked half a million , it would unhesitatingly have been given . <EOS>	68.04892535629037
<SOS> the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house , now become the property of dantès , were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds , etc. , that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house , without the least augmentation of rent , upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited . <EOS>	66.13393429016911
<SOS> this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan , and a multitude of theories were afloat , none of which was anywhere near the truth . <EOS>	92.64801656248939
<SOS> but what raised public astonishment to a climax , and set all conjecture at defiance , was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans , and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman 's hut , and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years . <EOS>	82.1695671831422
<SOS> but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present , consisting of an entirely new fishing boat , with two seines and a tender . <EOS>	58.46873948062431
<SOS> the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor , but they had seen him , upon quitting the hut , merely give some orders to a sailor , and then springing lightly on horseback , leave marseilles by the porte d'aix . <EOS>	87.44982704963763
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	56.88272527090249
<SOS> the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed , about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde , a little nearer to the former than to the latter , a small roadside inn , from the front of which hung , creaking and flapping in the wind , a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard . <EOS>	73.50824389102449
<SOS> this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road , and backed upon the rhône . <EOS>	49.03698651133147
<SOS> it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden , consisting of a small plot of ground , on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests . <EOS>	96.08338457032815
<SOS> a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence , but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict . <EOS>	78.7715760004633
<SOS> between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic , tomatoes , and eschalots ; while , lone and solitary , like a forgotten sentinel , a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot , and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun . <EOS>	63.89832639652543
<SOS> all these trees , great or small , were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows , one of the three curses of provence , the others being the durance and the parliament . <EOS>	60.36029372147088
<SOS> in the surrounding plain , which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground , were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat , the effect , no doubt , of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable . <EOS>	81.20672596057358
<SOS> each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper , which regaled the passers by through this egyptian scene with its strident , monotonous note . <EOS>	91.9735292262455
<SOS> for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife , with two servants , a chambermaid named trinette , and a hostler called pecaud . <EOS>	53.772525652603434
<SOS> this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements , for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach . <EOS>	108.10959227045709
<SOS> and , as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper , whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing , it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted , not a hundred steps from the inn , of which we have given a brief but faithful description . <EOS>	60.51421785542317
<SOS> the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age , tall , strong , and bony , a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes ; he had dark , sparkling , and deep set eyes , hooked nose , and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal ; his hair , like his beard , which he wore under his chin , was thick and curly , and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads . <EOS>	97.51078498400673
<SOS> his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door , on the lookout for guests who seldom came , yet there he stood , day after day , exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun , with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it , after the manner of the spanish muleteers . <EOS>	95.35830509900269
<SOS> this man was our old acquaintance , gaspard caderousse . <EOS>	58.36478431187486
<SOS> his wife , on the contrary , whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle , was pale , meagre , and sickly looking . <EOS>	83.02543133225409
<SOS> born in the neighborhood of arles , she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial ; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue . <EOS>	72.45099259631009
<SOS> she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber , shivering in her chair , or stretched languid and feeble on her bed , while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness , as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate , who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate ; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply , in these philosophic words : `` hush , la carconte . <EOS>	72.76928863333252
<SOS> it is god 's pleasure that things should be so . '' <EOS>	63.48559202630614
<SOS> the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village , so called , situated between salon and lambesc ; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation , her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine , which , in all probability , his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce . <EOS>	95.50281468611148
<SOS> still , let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence , the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits , and the daily infliction of his peevish partner 's murmurs and lamentations . <EOS>	78.32486967995068
<SOS> < num > m like other dwellers in the south , he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires , but fond of external show , vain , and addicted to display . <EOS>	71.36963610822299
<SOS> during the days of his prosperity , not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators . <EOS>	64.09453675356386
<SOS> he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france , bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians ; while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles , a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia . <EOS>	53.62257430183763
<SOS> but , by degrees , watch chains , necklaces , parti colored scarves , embroidered bodices , velvet vests , elegantly worked stockings , striped gaiters , and silver buckles for the shoes , all disappeared ; and gaspard caderousse , unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor , had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities , both for himself and wife , although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung , more for the shelter than the profit it afforded . <EOS>	105.36766017723178
<SOS> caderousse , then , was , as usual , at his place of observation before the door , his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously , though fruitlessly , endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road , which led away to the north and south , when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife , and grumbling to himself as he went , he mounted to her chamber , first taking care , however , to set the entrance door wide open , as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing . <EOS>	71.57979712746679
<SOS> at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door , the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday . <EOS>	55.110160689538446
<SOS> there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand , with its sides bordered by tall , meagre trees , altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance , that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller , at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying , would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara . <EOS>	60.39586838087952
<SOS> nevertheless , had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer , he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde ; as the moving object drew nearer , he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse , between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist . <EOS>	109.25669090570938
<SOS> the horse was of hungarian breed , and ambled along at an easy pace . <EOS>	75.12667804808206
<SOS> his rider was a priest , dressed in black , and wearing a three cornered hat ; and , spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun , the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity . <EOS>	80.9525644486969
<SOS> having arrived before the pont du gard , the horse stopped , but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say . <EOS>	42.54357764424897
<SOS> however that might have been , the priest , dismounting , led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him . <EOS>	67.4187604751609
<SOS> availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door , he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief , from his pocket , wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow , then , advancing to the door , struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick . <EOS>	83.26225905453609
<SOS> at this unusual sound , a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode , snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society . <EOS>	76.30719832169038
<SOS> at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor , and , with many bows and courteous smiles , the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter . <EOS>	75.79560529936332
<SOS> < num > m `` you are welcome , sir , most welcome ! '' <EOS>	96.91750417262203
<SOS> repeated the astonished caderousse . <EOS>	49.79711393533936
<SOS> `` now , then , margotin , '' cried he , speaking to the dog , `` will you be quiet ? <EOS>	107.05405030333176
<SOS> pray do n't heed him , sir ! <EOS>	68.20758632775483
<SOS> he only barks , he never bites . <EOS>	97.21419146260796
<SOS> i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day . '' <EOS>	77.1515735291347
<SOS> then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain , caderousse hastily exclaimed : `` a thousand pardons ! <EOS>	86.66026891303913
<SOS> i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof . <EOS>	84.99958072270711
<SOS> what would the abbé please to have ? <EOS>	75.15941281415432
<SOS> what refreshment can i offer ? <EOS>	55.79001140955043
<SOS> all i have is at his service . '' <EOS>	92.8313909225621
<SOS> the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper ; then , observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded , he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show , and therefore said , speaking with a strong italian accent , `` you are , i presume , m . <EOS>	68.62339998798814
<SOS> caderousse ? '' <EOS>	73.93708999964385
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' answered the host , even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it ; `` i am gaspard caderousse , at your service . '' <EOS>	87.2837971667309
<SOS> `` gaspard caderousse , '' rejoined the priest . <EOS>	90.17168570218915
<SOS> `` yes , christian and surname are the same . <EOS>	62.427358313620225
<SOS> you formerly lived , i believe in the allées de meilhan , on the fourth floor ? '' <EOS>	65.92844765884314
<SOS> < num > m `` i did . '' <EOS>	77.99873072258849
<SOS> `` and you followed the business of a tailor ? '' <EOS>	44.80759790272329
<SOS> `` true , i was a tailor , till the trade fell off . <EOS>	87.38944929049458
<SOS> it is so hot at marseilles , that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever . <EOS>	44.21083358416239
<SOS> but talking of heat , is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment ? '' <EOS>	64.44222758949395
<SOS> `` yes ; let me have a bottle of your best wine , and then , with your permission , we will resume our conversation from where we left off . '' <EOS>	86.09326280179519
<SOS> `` as you please , sir , '' said caderousse , who , anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession , hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in , which served both as parlor and kitchen . <EOS>	113.65244231178335
<SOS> upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes , he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool , leaning his elbow on a table , while margotin , whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments , had crept up to him , and had established himself very comfortably between his knees , his long , skinny neck resting on his lap , while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller 's face . <EOS>	91.43049449781984
<SOS> `` are you quite alone ? '' <EOS>	64.06748055451055
<SOS> inquired the guest , as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass . <EOS>	78.81957358576562
<SOS> `` quite , quite alone , '' replied the man `` or , at least , practically so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing ! '' <EOS>	73.07304665559366
<SOS> `` you are married , then ? '' <EOS>	74.20158573007494
<SOS> said the priest , with a show of interest , glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	114.23308194758349
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' said caderousse with a sigh , `` it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man ; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest . '' <EOS>	90.73451058175961
<SOS> the abbé fixed on him a searching , penetrating glance . <EOS>	104.15834807941769
<SOS> `` yes , honest i can certainly say that much for myself , '' continued the innkeeper , fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé 's gaze ; `` i can boast with truth of being an honest man ; and , '' continued he significantly , with a hand on his breast and shaking his head , `` that is more than everyone can say nowadays . '' <EOS>	100.45758775676337
<SOS> < num > m `` so much the better for you , if what you assert be true , '' said the abbé ; `` for i am firmly persuaded that , sooner or later , the good will be rewarded , and the wicked punished . '' <EOS>	52.69833562913722
<SOS> `` such words as those belong to your profession , '' answered caderousse , `` and you do well to repeat them ; but , '' added he , with a bitter expression of countenance , `` one is free to believe them or not , as one pleases . '' <EOS>	56.3060534679112
<SOS> `` you are wrong to speak thus , '' said the abbé ; `` and perhaps i may , in my own person , be able to prove to you how completely you are in error . '' <EOS>	69.85650540147145
<SOS> `` what mean you ? '' <EOS>	110.35398707572357
<SOS> inquired caderousse with a look of surprise . <EOS>	45.1507369609535
<SOS> `` in the first place , i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of . '' <EOS>	73.21291103637171
<SOS> `` what proofs do you require ? '' <EOS>	49.83034048630156
<SOS> `` did you , in the year < num > or < num > , know anything of a young sailor named dantès ? '' <EOS>	68.24803743222786
<SOS> `` dantès ? <EOS>	90.9870745403762
<SOS> did i know poor dear edmond ? <EOS>	70.46517142281017
<SOS> why , edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends ! '' <EOS>	48.11032934994032
<SOS> exclaimed caderousse , whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him , while the clear , calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny . <EOS>	82.80594302144382
<SOS> `` you remind me , '' said the priest , `` that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond . '' <EOS>	94.68986593039126
<SOS> `` said to bear the name ! '' <EOS>	65.76935652635035
<SOS> repeated caderousse , becoming excited and eager . <EOS>	59.88429276678243
<SOS> `` why , he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse ; but tell me , i pray , what has become of poor edmond ? <EOS>	82.10471565547208
<SOS> did you know him ? <EOS>	71.13594545472276
<SOS> is he alive and at liberty ? <EOS>	61.06900141795955
<SOS> is he prosperous and happy ? '' <EOS>	59.28091047833381
<SOS> `` he died a more wretched , hopeless , heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon . '' <EOS>	96.94293498146796
<SOS> a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse , who turned away , and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head . <EOS>	94.45148386713721
<SOS> `` poor fellow , poor fellow ! '' <EOS>	89.4242826880237
<SOS> murmured caderousse . <EOS>	97.26102400803099
<SOS> `` well , there , sir , is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth , and that none but the wicked prosper . <EOS>	85.62919849278137
<SOS> ah , '' continued caderousse , speaking in the highly colored language of the south , `` the world grows worse and worse . <EOS>	64.25446509462468
<SOS> why does not god , if he really hates the wicked , as he is said to do , send down brimstone and fire , and consume them altogether ? '' <EOS>	91.63588661805956
<SOS> `` you speak as though you had loved this young dantès , '' observed the abbé , without taking any notice of his companion 's vehemence . <EOS>	45.95122969693349
<SOS> `` and so i did , '' replied caderousse ; `` though once , i confess , i envied him his good fortune . <EOS>	45.799311790749144
<SOS> but i swear to you , sir , i swear to you , by everything a man holds dear , i have , since then , deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate . '' <EOS>	91.5155284548674
<SOS> there was a brief silence , during which the fixed , searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper . <EOS>	84.67741797019895
<SOS> `` you knew the poor lad , then ? '' <EOS>	55.24072932599309
<SOS> continued caderousse . <EOS>	98.31884328174148
<SOS> `` i was called to see him on his dying bed , that i might administer to him the consolations of religion . '' <EOS>	53.109171244857045
<SOS> `` and of what did he die ? '' <EOS>	69.65758214080948
<SOS> asked caderousse in a choking voice . <EOS>	65.19018514370161
<SOS> `` of what , think you , do young and strong men die in prison , when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year , unless it be of imprisonment ? '' <EOS>	66.41896210829839
<SOS> caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow . <EOS>	71.80634155955792
<SOS> < num > m `` but the strangest part of the story is , '' resumed the abbé , `` that dantès , even in his dying moments , swore by his crucified redeemer , that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention . '' <EOS>	58.78762476994053
<SOS> `` and so he was , '' murmured caderousse . <EOS>	73.53266834190522
<SOS> `` how should he have been otherwise ? <EOS>	91.19972266905556
<SOS> ah , sir , the poor fellow told you the truth . '' <EOS>	53.46914883824702
<SOS> `` and for that reason , he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate , and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it . '' <EOS>	68.74687762350241
<SOS> and here the look of the abbé , becoming more and more fixed , seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse . <EOS>	83.44133477015421
<SOS> `` a rich englishman , '' continued the abbé , `` who had been his companion in misfortune , but had been released from prison during the second restoration , was possessed of a diamond of immense value ; this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison , as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement . <EOS>	99.46200311415694
<SOS> instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers , who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor , dantès carefully preserved it , that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live , for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune . '' <EOS>	44.090402115835175
<SOS> `` then , i suppose , '' asked caderousse , with eager , glowing looks , `` that it was a stone of immense value ? '' <EOS>	73.76559031829427
<SOS> `` why , everything is relative , '' answered the abbé . <EOS>	65.0480226784018
<SOS> `` to one in edmond 's position the diamond certainly was of great value . <EOS>	60.94460240697395
<SOS> it was estimated at fifty thousand francs . '' <EOS>	79.22965032575402
<SOS> `` bless me ! '' <EOS>	70.23312110577777
<SOS> exclaimed caderousse , `` fifty thousand francs ! <EOS>	69.52342394853252
<SOS> surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that . '' <EOS>	64.49010948844665
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the abbé , `` it was not of such a size as that ; but you shall judge for yourself . <EOS>	108.6800235616068
<SOS> i have it with me . '' <EOS>	87.48678953340244
<SOS> the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest 's garments , as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure . <EOS>	85.51115887268669
<SOS> calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen , the abbé opened it , and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained , set in a ring of admirable workmanship . <EOS>	82.04341244473636
<SOS> `` and that diamond , '' cried caderousse , almost breathless with eager admiration , `` you say , is worth fifty thousand francs ? '' <EOS>	82.2482726543535
<SOS> `` it is , without the setting , which is also valuable , '' replied the abbé , as he closed the box , and returned it to his pocket , while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper . <EOS>	59.95021876102649
<SOS> `` but how comes the diamond in your possession , sir ? <EOS>	91.38725825806381
<SOS> did edmond make you his heir ? '' <EOS>	63.1345305815073
<SOS> `` no , merely his testamentary executor . <EOS>	85.12460137043264
<SOS> ' i once possessed four dear and faithful friends , besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed ' he said ; 'and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss . <EOS>	104.28732539617215
<SOS> the name of one of the four friends is caderousse . ' '' <EOS>	60.19027777348908
<SOS> the innkeeper shivered . <EOS>	98.60627720276466
<SOS> `` 'another of the number , ' '' continued the abbé , without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse , `` 'is called danglars ; and the third , in spite of being my rival , entertained a very sincere affection for me . ' '' <EOS>	60.349117391774406
<SOS> a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse , who was about to break in upon the abbé 's speech , when the latter , waving his hand , said , `` allow me to finish first , and then if you have any observations to make , you can do so afterwards . <EOS>	48.52558742244172
<SOS> 'the third of my friends , although my rival , was much attached to me , his name was fernand ; that of my betrothed was ' stay , stay , '' continued the abbé , `` i have forgotten what he called her . '' <EOS>	45.839283811083114
<SOS> `` mercédès , '' said caderousse eagerly . <EOS>	91.85397574448841
<SOS> `` true , '' said the abbé , with a stifled sigh , `` mercédès it was . '' <EOS>	66.5197543553784
<SOS> `` go on , '' urged caderousse . <EOS>	99.2665772539643
<SOS> `` bring me a carafe of water , '' said the abbé . <EOS>	81.36380863234395
<SOS> caderousse quickly performed the stranger 's bidding ; and after pouring some into a glass , and slowly swallowing its contents , the abbé , resuming his usual placidity of manner , said , as he placed his empty glass on the table : `` where did we leave off ? '' <EOS>	85.24615034897406
<SOS> `` the name of edmond 's betrothed was mercédès . '' <EOS>	103.43152510361114
<SOS> `` to be sure . <EOS>	50.764784924247785
<SOS> 'you will go to marseilles , ' said dantès , for you understand , i repeat his words just as he uttered them . <EOS>	83.58069157868292
<SOS> do you understand ? '' <EOS>	69.84267254518433
<SOS> `` perfectly . '' <EOS>	71.32535896668341
<SOS> `` 'you will sell this diamond ; you will divide the money into five equal parts , and give an equal portion to these good friends , the only persons who have loved me upon earth . ' '' <EOS>	83.43387837951607
<SOS> `` but why into five parts ? '' <EOS>	53.456664521787715
<SOS> asked caderousse ; `` you only mentioned four persons . '' <EOS>	111.20878988987776
<SOS> `` because the fifth is dead , as i hear . <EOS>	63.6742084434559
<SOS> the fifth sharer in edmond 's bequest , was his own father . '' <EOS>	69.55940242313002
<SOS> `` too true , too true ! '' <EOS>	65.7223573121022
<SOS> ejaculated caderousse , almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him , `` the poor old man did die . '' <EOS>	66.62112171337347
<SOS> `` i learned so much at marseilles , '' replied the abbé , making a strong effort to appear indifferent ; `` but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès , i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end . <EOS>	58.976191538487505
<SOS> can you enlighten me on that point ? '' <EOS>	78.54433969541428
<SOS> `` i do not know who could if i could not , '' said caderousse . <EOS>	78.2262154003246
<SOS> `` why , i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man . <EOS>	90.52570256100066
<SOS> ah , yes , about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died . '' <EOS>	62.77147358920501
<SOS> `` of what did he die ? '' <EOS>	79.27902636730192
<SOS> `` why , the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis , i believe ; his acquaintances say he died of grief ; but i , who saw him in his dying moments , i say he died of `` caderousse paused . <EOS>	60.49492224968274
<SOS> `` of what ? '' <EOS>	50.38084121284233
<SOS> asked the priest , anxiously and eagerly . <EOS>	80.92946718036366
<SOS> `` why , of downright starvation . '' <EOS>	57.460870545208635
<SOS> `` starvation ! '' <EOS>	62.66942694373969
<SOS> exclaimed the abbé , springing from his seat . <EOS>	52.71211263114179
<SOS> `` why , the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that . <EOS>	82.44491238316024
<SOS> the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread ; and that a man , a christian , should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians , is too horrible for belief . <EOS>	81.98567219306695
<SOS> oh , it is impossible ! <EOS>	44.90537551654495
<SOS> utterly impossible ! '' <EOS>	63.96242803895396
<SOS> `` what i have said , i have said , '' answered caderousse . <EOS>	90.99851585241959
<SOS> `` and you are a fool for having said anything about it , '' said a voice from the top of the stairs . <EOS>	49.66402350140448
<SOS> `` why should you meddle with what does not concern you ? '' <EOS>	83.19661181034841
<SOS> the two men turned quickly , and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails ; attracted by the sound of voices , she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs , and , seated on the lower step , head on knees , she had listened to the foregoing conversation . <EOS>	64.8379588562625
<SOS> `` mind your own business , wife , '' replied caderousse sharply . <EOS>	74.52955141226187
<SOS> `` this gentleman asks me for information , which common politeness will not permit me to refuse . '' <EOS>	54.34015045906677
<SOS> `` politeness , you simpleton ! '' <EOS>	85.68107538027057
<SOS> retorted la carconte . <EOS>	80.36425093173239
<SOS> `` what have you to do with politeness , i should like to know ? <EOS>	74.46927371084452
<SOS> better study a little common prudence . <EOS>	78.26655438022715
<SOS> how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you ? '' <EOS>	111.66697734452015
<SOS> `` i pledge you my word , madam , '' said the abbé , `` that my intentions are good ; and that your husband can incur no risk , provided he answers me candidly . '' <EOS>	66.97705106292604
<SOS> `` ah , that 's all very fine , '' retorted the woman . <EOS>	63.417996671405525
<SOS> `` nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear ; but when poor , silly folks , like my husband there , have been persuaded to tell all they know , the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten ; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it , behold trouble and misery , and all sorts of persecutions , are heaped on the unfortunate wretches , who can not even see whence all their afflictions come . '' <EOS>	90.20508049473229
<SOS> `` nay , nay , my good woman , make yourself perfectly easy , i beg of you . <EOS>	77.25155129023337
<SOS> whatever evils may befall you , they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality , that i solemnly promise you . '' <EOS>	61.65518022808975
<SOS> la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words , then let her head again drop upon her knees , and went into a fit of ague , leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation , but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered . <EOS>	70.17505611736316
<SOS> again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him . <EOS>	88.23103349587855
<SOS> when he had sufficiently recovered himself , he said , `` it appears , then , that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone . <EOS>	72.93169050900224
<SOS> surely , had not such been the case , he would not have perished by so dreadful a death . '' <EOS>	89.10726392598849
<SOS> `` why , he was not altogether forsaken , '' continued caderousse , `` for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him ; but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person , '' added caderousse with a bitter smile , `` that you named just now as being one of dantès ' faithful and attached friends . '' <EOS>	65.98449057133713
<SOS> `` and was he not so ? '' <EOS>	80.66669066790439
<SOS> asked the abbé . <EOS>	75.95337454942998
<SOS> `` gaspard , gaspard ! '' <EOS>	42.612428858232
<SOS> murmured the woman , from her seat on the stairs , `` mind what you are saying ! '' <EOS>	54.0004570083982
<SOS> caderousse made no reply to these words , though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption , but , addressing the abbé , said , `` can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself ? <EOS>	57.41992337129003
<SOS> but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature , that he believed everybody 's professions of friendship . <EOS>	102.69205751815
<SOS> poor edmond , he was cruelly deceived ; but it was fortunate that he never knew , or he might have found it more difficult , when on his deathbed , to pardon his enemies . <EOS>	65.45963425679683
<SOS> and , whatever people may say , '' continued caderousse , in his native language , which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry , `` i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living . '' <EOS>	73.81554601205394
<SOS> `` imbecile ! '' <EOS>	77.05961578575445
<SOS> exclaimed la carconte . <EOS>	99.57398894489988
<SOS> `` do you , then , know in what manner fernand injured dantès ? '' <EOS>	75.69938866249065
<SOS> inquired the abbé of caderousse . <EOS>	58.49237776991699
<SOS> `` do i ? <EOS>	108.25486278796245
<SOS> no one better . '' <EOS>	66.39165603370094

<SOS> `` gaspard ! '' <EOS>	64.69525611100353
<SOS> cried la carconte , `` do as you will ; you are master but if you take my advice you 'll hold your tongue . '' <EOS>	96.32091230136828
<SOS> `` well , wife , '' replied caderousse , `` i do n't know but what you 're right ! '' <EOS>	86.91316300477342
<SOS> `` so you will say nothing ? '' <EOS>	71.24989010813616
<SOS> asked the abbé . <EOS>	65.02402592963578
<SOS> `` why , what good would it do ? '' <EOS>	73.88896709048447
<SOS> asked caderousse . <EOS>	39.73434781255587
<SOS> `` if the poor lad were living , and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends , why , perhaps , i should not hesitate . <EOS>	81.22563407996499
<SOS> but you tell me he is no more , and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge , so let all such feeling be buried with him . '' <EOS>	45.82129606736947
<SOS> `` you prefer , then , '' said the abbé , `` that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous , the reward intended for faithful friendship ? '' <EOS>	90.89367659553918
<SOS> `` that is true enough , '' returned caderousse . <EOS>	48.7670642409424
<SOS> `` you say truly , the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars ; besides , what would it be to them ? <EOS>	95.30962967731341
<SOS> no more than a drop of water in the ocean . '' <EOS>	70.16084806568145
<SOS> `` remember , '' chimed in la carconte , `` those two could crush you at a single blow ! '' <EOS>	75.81778358778409
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	90.17702158355428
<SOS> inquired the abbé . <EOS>	46.03692942689902
<SOS> `` are these persons , then , so rich and powerful ? '' <EOS>	116.39106674076247
<SOS> `` do you not know their history ? '' <EOS>	87.63744970737359
<SOS> `` i do not . <EOS>	84.77675744777923
<SOS> pray relate it to me ! '' <EOS>	89.17983609079394
<SOS> caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments , then said , `` no , truly , it would take up too much time . '' <EOS>	75.01047040361574
<SOS> `` well , my good friend , '' returned the abbé , in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part , `` you are at liberty , either to speak or be silent , just as you please ; for my own part , i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments ; so let the matter end . <EOS>	77.24959549399972
<SOS> i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can , and fulfil my promise to the dying man . <EOS>	49.1494355553305
<SOS> my first business will be to dispose of this diamond . '' <EOS>	74.20033530878321
<SOS> so saying , the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket , opened it , and contrived to hold it in such a light , that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse . <EOS>	81.73384680687752
<SOS> `` wife , wife ! '' <EOS>	84.055612870171
<SOS> cried he in a hoarse voice , `` come here ! '' <EOS>	56.163104294715545
<SOS> `` diamond ! '' <EOS>	49.442981926139595
<SOS> exclaimed la carconte , rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step ; `` what diamond are you talking about ? '' <EOS>	81.39587051202672
<SOS> `` why , did you not hear all we said ? '' <EOS>	113.16810717275611
<SOS> inquired caderousse . <EOS>	109.4282735889897
<SOS> `` it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantès , to be sold , and the money divided between his father , mercédès , his betrothed bride , fernand , danglars , and myself . <EOS>	75.93712056881853
<SOS> the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs . '' <EOS>	75.4721266564307
<SOS> `` oh , what a magnificent jewel ! '' <EOS>	70.84962055445482
<SOS> cried the astonished woman . <EOS>	75.67891877457566
<SOS> `` the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then , does it not ? '' <EOS>	83.92143303941548
<SOS> asked caderousse . <EOS>	75.04016204527109
<SOS> `` it does , '' replied the abbé ; `` with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès , which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors . '' <EOS>	67.31699400386724
<SOS> `` and why among us four ? '' <EOS>	74.18238278748326
<SOS> inquired caderousse . <EOS>	97.85862475410525
<SOS> `` as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him . '' <EOS>	91.70473501399023
<SOS> `` i do n't call those friends who betray and ruin you , '' murmured the wife in her turn , in a low , muttering voice . <EOS>	87.24024122338264
<SOS> `` of course not ! '' <EOS>	94.33470421883061
<SOS> rejoined caderousse quickly ; `` no more do i , and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now . <EOS>	58.51858841799289
<SOS> i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime . '' <EOS>	61.25991788600523
<SOS> `` remember , '' answered the abbé calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , `` it is your fault , not mine , that i do so . <EOS>	66.9680349196315
<SOS> you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars , in order that i may execute edmond 's last wishes . '' <EOS>	63.71151814452052
<SOS> the agitation of caderousse became extreme , and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow . <EOS>	75.14269991196785
<SOS> as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door , as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey , caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning . <EOS>	52.798439375955525
<SOS> < num > m `` there , you see , wife , '' said the former , `` this splendid diamond might all be ours , if we chose ! '' <EOS>	63.34797783315419
<SOS> `` do you believe it ? '' <EOS>	76.63520335553645
<SOS> `` why , surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us ! '' <EOS>	61.97378009073762
<SOS> `` well , '' replied la carconte , `` do as you like . <EOS>	46.44971670621079
<SOS> for my part , i wash my hands of the affair . '' <EOS>	90.72140658761063
<SOS> so saying , she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber , her body convulsed with chills , and her teeth rattling in her head , in spite of the intense heat of the weather . <EOS>	100.78093736881557
<SOS> arrived at the top stair , she turned round , and called out , in a warning tone , to her husband , `` gaspard , consider well what you are about to do ! '' <EOS>	102.50223883329886
<SOS> `` i have both reflected and decided , '' answered he . <EOS>	64.09005570175013
<SOS> la carconte then entered her chamber , the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy , uncertain tread , as she proceeded towards her armchair , into which she fell as though exhausted . <EOS>	93.4203766736881
<SOS> `` well , '' asked the abbé , as he returned to the apartment below , `` what have you made up your mind to do ? '' <EOS>	78.42983147138368
<SOS> `` to tell you all i know , '' was the reply . <EOS>	89.15351832021926
<SOS> `` i certainly think you act wisely in so doing , '' said the priest . <EOS>	111.73980186544851
<SOS> `` not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me , but simply that if , through your assistance , i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator , why , so much the better , that is all . '' <EOS>	63.61337941147708
<SOS> `` i hope it may be so , '' replied caderousse , his face flushed with cupidity . <EOS>	62.84933276104253
<SOS> `` i am all attention , '' said the abbé . <EOS>	62.17996970361628
<SOS> `` stop a minute , '' answered caderousse ; `` we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story , which would be a pity ; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves . '' <EOS>	72.55935248863675
<SOS> with these words he went stealthily to the door , which he closed , and , by way of still greater precaution , bolted and barred it , as he was accustomed to do at night . <EOS>	102.79102326920939
<SOS> during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease . <EOS>	63.98115398302563
<SOS> he removed his seat into a corner of the room , where he himself would be in deep shadow , while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator ; then , with head bent down and hands clasped , or rather clenched together , he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse , who seated himself on the little stool , exactly opposite to him . <EOS>	54.92005581401014
<SOS> `` remember , this is no affair of mine , '' said the trembling voice of la carconte , as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below . <EOS>	75.43264653378988
<SOS> `` enough , enough ! '' <EOS>	55.6992736131243
<SOS> replied caderousse ; `` say no more about it ; i will take all the consequences upon myself . '' <EOS>	75.99029204485271
<SOS> and he began his story . <EOS>	63.87094076262588
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	57.34142841918838
<SOS> the story first , sir , '' said caderousse , `` you must make me a promise . '' <EOS>	49.861602310661794
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	74.65649920454162
<SOS> inquired the abbé . <EOS>	68.53521058970077
<SOS> `` why , if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you , that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them ; for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful , and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me , i should break to pieces like glass . '' <EOS>	55.64405063179534
<SOS> `` make yourself easy , my friend , '' replied the abbé . <EOS>	95.47641795682726
<SOS> `` i am a priest , and confessions die in my breast . <EOS>	82.45447113682435
<SOS> recollect , our only desire is to carry out , in a fitting manner , the last wishes of our friend . <EOS>	107.80313696870559
<SOS> speak , then , without reserve , as without hatred ; tell the truth , the whole truth ; i do not know , never may know , the persons of whom you are about to speak ; besides , i am an italian , and not a frenchman , and belong to god , and not to man , and i shall shortly retire to my convent , which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man . '' <EOS>	74.5853821755828
<SOS> this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage . <EOS>	86.30489487851969
<SOS> `` well , then , under these circumstances , '' said caderousse , `` i will , i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable . '' <EOS>	59.36839208006113
<SOS> `` begin with his father , if you please . '' <EOS>	77.65356952573423
<SOS> said the abbé ; `` edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love . '' <EOS>	48.573125174253114
<SOS> `` the history is a sad one , sir , '' said caderousse , shaking his head ; `` perhaps you know all the earlier part of it ? '' <EOS>	92.71064638153496

<SOS> `` dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them . '' <EOS>	75.56260334833367
<SOS> `` well , when dantès was arrested , monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad . <EOS>	92.23990308486414
<SOS> the old man returned alone to his home , folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes , and paced up and down his chamber the whole day , and would not go to bed at all , for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night ; and for myself , i assure you i could not sleep either , for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness , and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast . <EOS>	42.73012126718866
<SOS> `` the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m. de villefort ; she did not obtain it , however , and went to visit the old man ; when she saw him so miserable and heart broken , having passed a sleepless night , and not touched food since the previous day , she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him ; but the old man would not consent . <EOS>	76.06100187164905
<SOS> 'no , ' was the old man 's reply , ' i will not leave this house , for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world ; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing , and what would he think if i did not wait here for him ? ' <EOS>	64.81436792064503

<SOS> i can not now repeat to you , sir , all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of ; it was more than piety , it was more than grief , and i , who am no canter , and hate the jesuits , said then to myself , 'it is really well , and i am very glad that i have not any children ; for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does , and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying , i should throw myself into the sea at once , for i could not bear it .

<SOS> the door was closed , but i looked through the keyhole , and saw him so pale and haggard , that believing him very ill , i went and told m. morrel and then ran on to mercédès . <EOS>	97.83663003384594
<SOS> they both came immediately , m. morrel bringing a doctor , and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels , and ordered him a limited diet . <EOS>	70.52804539483529

<SOS> mercédès remained , therefore , by his bedside , and m. morrel went away , making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece ; but , availing himself of the doctor 's order , the old man would not take any sustenance ; at length ( after nine days of despair and fasting ) , the old man died , cursing those who had caused his misery , and saying to mercédès , 'if you ever see my edmond again , tell him i die blessing him .

<SOS> the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy , made his bow and went away , proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned . <EOS>	72.95696950837551
<SOS> m. de boville was in his private room , and the englishman , on perceiving him , made a gesture of surprise , which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence . <EOS>	71.49741266531386
<SOS> as to m. de boville , he was in such a state of despair , that it was evident all the faculties of his mind , absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment , did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past . <EOS>	84.96692265421936
<SOS> the englishman , with the coolness of his nation , addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles . <EOS>	74.46766536314509

<SOS> `` very possibly ; but what sort of madness was it ? '' <EOS>	75.85882089922042
<SOS> `` he pretended to know of an immense treasure , and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him . '' <EOS>	59.90103550779061
<SOS> `` poor devil ! <EOS>	102.088116799114
<SOS> and he is dead ? '' <EOS>	50.6363687460758

<SOS> `` may i ask what that was ? '' <EOS>	88.60777236332717
<SOS> said the englishman with an expression of curiosity , which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance . <EOS>	70.93050369427495
<SOS> `` oh dear , yes , sir ; the abbé 's dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte 's emissaries , one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in < num > , a very resolute and very dangerous man . '' <EOS>	52.95895076366209
<SOS> `` indeed ! '' <EOS>	61.13091055771787
<SOS> said the englishman . <EOS>	93.57142901398582
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied m. de boville ; `` i myself had occasion to see this man in < num > or < num > , and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers . <EOS>	91.94681265813661

<SOS> `` and you say , sir , '' he interposed , `` that the two dungeons `` `` were separated by a distance of fifty feet ; but it appears that this edmond dantès `` `` this dangerous man 's name was `` `` edmond dantès . <EOS>	88.53239043111294
<SOS> it appears , sir , that this edmond dantès had procured tools , or made them , for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another . '' <EOS>	98.67908569204666
<SOS> `` this tunnel was dug , no doubt , with an intention of escape ? '' <EOS>	91.7949790547407
<SOS> `` no doubt ; but unfortunately for the prisoners , the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy , and died . '' <EOS>	65.14221227784934
<SOS> `` that must have cut short the projects of escape . '' <EOS>	104.41301957736935
<SOS> `` for the dead man , yes , '' replied m. de boville , `` but not for the survivor ; on the contrary , this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape . <EOS>	60.464895625328445
<SOS> he , no doubt , thought that prisoners who died in the château d'if were interred in an ordinary burial ground , and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell , took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse , and awaited the moment of interment . '' <EOS>	60.03363109288868
<SOS> `` it was a bold step , and one that showed some courage , '' remarked the englishman . <EOS>	51.53167504707334
<SOS> `` as i have already told you , sir , he was a very dangerous man ; and , fortunately , by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account . '' <EOS>	64.62517988381569
<SOS> `` how was that ? '' <EOS>	82.34564289581193
<SOS> `` how ? <EOS>	95.0734997196207
<SOS> do you not comprehend ? '' <EOS>	54.28204245097065
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	57.252095497310016
<SOS> `` the château d'if has no cemetery , and they simply throw the dead into the sea , after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their feet . '' <EOS>	69.89307156346679
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	74.79691856412916
<SOS> observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension . <EOS>	87.85591737046245
<SOS> `` well , they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet , and threw him into the sea . '' <EOS>	46.35568671337729
<SOS> `` really ! '' <EOS>	116.60435777039487
<SOS> exclaimed the englishman . <EOS>	88.20523569007256
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' continued the inspector of prisons . <EOS>	67.91479965626638
<SOS> `` you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks ! <EOS>	65.9557026243618
<SOS> i should like to have seen his face at that moment . '' <EOS>	48.572072845009274
<SOS> `` that would have been difficult . '' <EOS>	57.26995727919666
<SOS> `` no matter , '' replied de boville , in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs , `` no matter , i can fancy it . '' <EOS>	94.7970675071499
<SOS> and he shouted with laughter . <EOS>	74.7691682436705
<SOS> `` so can i , '' said the englishman , and he laughed too ; but he laughed as the english do , `` at the end of his teeth . '' <EOS>	75.4918805957734
<SOS> `` and so , '' continued the englishman who first gained his composure , `` he was drowned ? '' <EOS>	77.16411296879454
<SOS> `` unquestionably . '' <EOS>	57.766843996287676
<SOS> `` so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time ? '' <EOS>	61.04566721203833
<SOS> `` precisely . '' <EOS>	60.272336386926085
<SOS> < num > m `` but some official document was drawn up as to this affair , i suppose ? '' <EOS>	68.98677754839022
<SOS> inquired the englishman . <EOS>	97.14237863540856
<SOS> `` yes , yes , the mortuary deposition . <EOS>	73.77998432591903
<SOS> you understand , dantès ' relations , if he had any , might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive . '' <EOS>	82.16301869018439
<SOS> `` so that now , if there were anything to inherit from him , they may do so with easy conscience . <EOS>	78.3394024852419
<SOS> he is dead , and no mistake about it . '' <EOS>	86.097534566351
<SOS> `` oh , yes ; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please . '' <EOS>	114.8506122888289
<SOS> `` so be it , '' said the englishman . <EOS>	88.11737128805572
<SOS> `` but to return to these registers . '' <EOS>	64.14360824597
<SOS> `` true , this story has diverted our attention from them . <EOS>	95.90021072823181
<SOS> excuse me . '' <EOS>	62.08431914929127
<SOS> `` excuse you for what ? <EOS>	112.54347494342566
<SOS> for the story ? <EOS>	51.012558933313564
<SOS> by no means ; it really seems to me very curious . '' <EOS>	106.12246073357602
<SOS> `` yes , indeed . <EOS>	70.64366769865079
<SOS> so , sir , you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé , who really was gentleness itself . '' <EOS>	46.00998118998247
<SOS> `` yes , you will much oblige me . '' <EOS>	65.39983383381595
<SOS> `` go into my study here , and i will show it to you . '' <EOS>	60.33898406618978
<SOS> and they both entered m. de boville 's study . <EOS>	95.19225488920604
<SOS> everything was here arranged in perfect order ; each register had its number , each file of papers its place . <EOS>	68.64045896709658
<SOS> the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair , and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d'if , giving him all the time he desired for the examination , while de boville seated himself in a corner , and began to read his newspaper . <EOS>	70.83490774911338
<SOS> the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria ; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly , for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès . <EOS>	95.30699583756258
<SOS> there he found everything arranged in due order , the accusation , examination , morrel 's petition , m. de villefort 's marginal notes . <EOS>	53.17130716564669
<SOS> he folded up the accusation quietly , and put it as quietly in his pocket ; read the examination , and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it ; perused , too , the application dated < num > th april , < num > , in which morrel , by the deputy procureur 's advice , exaggerated with the best intentions ( for napoleon was then on the throne ) the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort 's certificates rendered indisputable . <EOS>	48.51573224402397
<SOS> then he saw through the whole thing . <EOS>	50.99457947685258
<SOS> this petition to napoleon , kept back by villefort , had become , under the second restoration , a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king 's attorney . <EOS>	63.30435245682589
<SOS> he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note , placed in a bracket against his name : edmond dantès . <EOS>	102.64403020629048
<SOS> an inveterate bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from the island of elba . <EOS>	65.29924991182769
<SOS> to be kept in strict solitary confinement , and to be closely watched and guarded . <EOS>	64.0222701713466
<SOS> beneath these lines was written in another hand : `` see note above nothing can be done . '' <EOS>	91.2193676666674
<SOS> he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel 's petition , and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say , was in villefort 's handwriting . <EOS>	94.18291273438749
<SOS> < num > m as to the note which accompanied this , the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès ' situation , but who had , from the remarks we have quoted , found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt . <EOS>	83.72313237265257
<SOS> as we have said , the inspector , from discretion , and that he might not disturb the abbé faria 's pupil in his researches , had seated himself in a corner , and was reading le drapeau blanc . <EOS>	56.76104769190749
<SOS> he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve , and which had the postmark , `` marseilles , < num > th february , delivery < num > o'clock , p.m. '' but it must be said that if he had seen it , he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper , and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs , that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do , however irregular it might be . <EOS>	64.80673467092039
<SOS> `` thanks , '' said the latter , closing the register with a slam , `` i have all i want ; now it is for me to perform my promise . <EOS>	59.28308754304805
<SOS> give me a simple assignment of your debt ; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash , and i will hand you over the money . '' <EOS>	59.60713922459499
<SOS> he rose , gave his seat to m. de boville , who took it without ceremony , and quickly drew up the required assignment , while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk . <EOS>	114.89899559692763
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	66.4976203973299
<SOS> the house of morrel & son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously , well acquainted with the interior of morrel 's warehouse , and had returned at this date , would have found a great change . <EOS>	64.855230937807
<SOS> instead of that air of life , of comfort , and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows , busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods , re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters , one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom . <EOS>	53.95051387316795
<SOS> out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office , but two remained . <EOS>	62.35505993152321
<SOS> one was a young man of three or four and twenty , who was in love with m. morrel 's daughter , and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw ; the other was an old one eyed cashier , called `` cocles , '' or `` cock eye , '' a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive , and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not , in all probability , have replied to anyone who addressed him by it . <EOS>	54.251638488774454
<SOS> cocles remained in m. morrel 's service , and a most singular change had taken place in his position ; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier , and sunk to the rank of a servant . <EOS>	65.37832836448729
<SOS> he was , however , the same cocles , good , patient , devoted , but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic , the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world , even against m. morrel ; and strong in the multiplication table , which he had at his fingers ' ends , no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him . <EOS>	81.21081147968927
<SOS> in the midst of the disasters that befell the house , cocles was the only one unmoved . <EOS>	90.49079573649499
<SOS> but this did not arise from a want of affection ; on the contrary , from a firm conviction . <EOS>	82.04351606675797
<SOS> like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor , so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse . <EOS>	69.33611341785117
<SOS> cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure . <EOS>	73.36092251038285
<SOS> everything was as we have said , a question of arithmetic to cocles , and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude , that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment , as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow . <EOS>	40.38585381935941
<SOS> nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles ' belief ; the last month 's payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude ; cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash , and the same evening he had brought them to m. morrel , who , with a melancholy smile , threw them into an almost empty drawer , saying : `` thanks , cocles ; you are the pearl of cashiers . '' <EOS>	79.19108878641212
<SOS> cocles went away perfectly happy , for this eulogium of m. morrel , himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles , flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns . <EOS>	74.67751210063612
<SOS> but since the end of the month m. morrel had passed many an anxious hour . <EOS>	84.39427018250183
<SOS> in order to meet the payments then due ; he had collected all his resources , and , fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity , he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife 's and daughter 's jewels and a portion of his plate . <EOS>	74.46170846735771
<SOS> by this means the end of the month was passed , but his resources were now exhausted . <EOS>	67.15723183368395
<SOS> credit , owing to the reports afloat , was no longer to be had ; and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the < num > th of the present month , and the one hundred thousand francs due on the < num > th of the next month to m. de boville , m. morrel had , in reality , no hope but the return of the pharaon , of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time , and which had already arrived in harbor . <EOS>	85.32489563714087
<SOS> but this vessel which , like the pharaon , came from calcutta , had been in for a fortnight , while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon . <EOS>	68.08207159315783
<SOS> < num > m such was the state of affairs when , the day after his interview with m. de boville , the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french of rome , presented himself at m. morrel 's . <EOS>	50.81939331628904
<SOS> emmanuel received him ; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face , for every new face might be that of a new creditor , come in anxiety to question the head of the house . <EOS>	58.03352345317288
<SOS> the young man , wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview , questioned the new comer ; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m. emmanuel , and that his business was with m. morrel in person . <EOS>	64.83026435293704
<SOS> emmanuel sighed , and summoned cocles . <EOS>	63.737018005491514
<SOS> cocles appeared , and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m. morrel 's apartment . <EOS>	62.812706132655734
<SOS> cocles went first , and the stranger followed him . <EOS>	58.835858415822955
<SOS> on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen , who looked with anxiety at the stranger . <EOS>	55.62150740887033
<SOS> `` m. morrel is in his room , is he not , mademoiselle julie ? '' <EOS>	57.09406572989257
<SOS> said the cashier . <EOS>	52.58948759541341
<SOS> `` yes ; i think so , at least , '' said the young girl hesitatingly . <EOS>	99.38801147101587
<SOS> `` go and see , cocles , and if my father is there , announce this gentleman . '' <EOS>	107.29084128781817
<SOS> `` it will be useless to announce me , mademoiselle , '' returned the englishman . <EOS>	86.7206846821087
<SOS> `` m. morrel does not know my name ; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french of rome , with whom your father does business . '' <EOS>	96.17186959457578
<SOS> the young girl turned pale and continued to descend , while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase . <EOS>	67.7882798055437
<SOS> she entered the office where emmanuel was , while cocles , by the aid of a key he possessed , opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase , conducted the stranger into an antechamber , opened a second door , which he closed behind him , and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson & french alone , returned and signed to him that he could enter . <EOS>	97.15028517711892
<SOS> the englishman entered , and found morrel seated at a table , turning over the formidable columns of his ledger , which contained the list of his liabilities . <EOS>	85.64033440781395
<SOS> at the sight of the stranger , m. morrel closed the ledger , arose , and offered a seat to the stranger ; and when he had seen him seated , resumed his own chair . <EOS>	97.81998498973356
<SOS> fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant , who , in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history , was now in his fiftieth ; his hair had turned white , time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow , and his look , once so firm and penetrating , was now irresolute and wandering , as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person . <EOS>	60.603254987256854
<SOS> the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest . <EOS>	78.63148205965327
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said morrel , whose uneasiness was increased by this examination , `` you wish to speak to me ? '' <EOS>	94.8176567699708
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur ; you are aware from whom i come ? '' <EOS>	79.68341918497333
<SOS> `` the house of thomson & french ; at least , so my cashier tells me . '' <EOS>	79.89790600937013
<SOS> `` he has told you rightly . <EOS>	52.31274787616181
<SOS> the house of thomson & french had < num > , < num > or < num > , < num > francs to pay this month in france ; and , knowing your strict punctuality , have collected all the bills bearing your signature , and charged me as they became due to present them , and to employ the money otherwise . '' <EOS>	57.56231333524511
<SOS> morrel sighed deeply , and passed his hand over his forehead , which was covered with perspiration . <EOS>	61.27690390617133
<SOS> `` so then , sir , '' said morrel , `` you hold bills of mine ? '' <EOS>	107.396328065287
<SOS> `` yes , and for a considerable sum . '' <EOS>	83.92393714499065
<SOS> `` what is the amount ? '' <EOS>	72.61277829414404
<SOS> asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm . <EOS>	87.26042463023572
<SOS> < num > m `` here is , '' said the englishman , taking a quantity of papers from his pocket , `` an assignment of < num > , < num > francs to our house by m. de boville , the inspector of prisons , to whom they are due . <EOS>	77.00206892121979
<SOS> you acknowledge , of course , that you owe this sum to him ? '' <EOS>	85.4323411817288
<SOS> `` yes ; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago . '' <EOS>	43.96840479447949
<SOS> `` when are you to pay ? '' <EOS>	84.68678267836879
<SOS> `` half the < num > th of this month , half the < num > th of next . '' <EOS>	90.72751505229063
<SOS> `` just so ; and now here are < num > , < num > francs payable shortly ; they are all signed by you , and assigned to our house by the holders . '' <EOS>	78.62848020213737
<SOS> `` i recognize them , '' said morrel , whose face was suffused , as he thought that , for the first time in his life , he would be unable to honor his own signature . <EOS>	56.17008209517913
<SOS> `` is this all ? '' <EOS>	65.36691141342929
<SOS> `` no , i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal , and the house of wild & turner of marseilles , amounting to nearly < num > , < num > francs ; in all , < num > , < num > francs . '' <EOS>	67.59726119672004
<SOS> it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration . <EOS>	61.67149421736538
<SOS> `` two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred francs , '' repeated he . <EOS>	88.74965776274546
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the englishman . <EOS>	93.6505284038691
<SOS> `` i will not , '' continued he , after a moment 's silence , `` conceal from you , that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged , yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities . '' <EOS>	97.1223694410572
<SOS> at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale . <EOS>	43.45984188175767
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he , `` up to this time and it is now more than four and twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father , who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years never has anything bearing the signature of morrel & son been dishonored .

<SOS> `` i know that , '' replied the englishman . <EOS>	110.63769053015214
<SOS> `` but as a man of honor should answer another , tell me fairly , shall you pay these with the same punctuality ? '' <EOS>	65.02175108511548
<SOS> morrel shuddered , and looked at the man , who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown . <EOS>	93.7918200542748
<SOS> `` to questions frankly put , '' said he , `` a straightforward answer should be given . <EOS>	99.8570761626463
<SOS> yes , i shall pay , if , as i hope , my vessel arrives safely ; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents , of which i have been the victim , have deprived me ; but if the pharaon should be lost , and this last resource be gone `` the poor man 's eyes filled with tears . <EOS>	76.37151348741259
<SOS> `` well , '' said the other , `` if this last resource fail you ? '' <EOS>	94.95401767602124
<SOS> `` well , '' returned morrel , `` it is a cruel thing to be forced to say , but , already used to misfortune , i must habituate myself to shame . <EOS>	87.28820242907587
<SOS> i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment . '' <EOS>	86.12575935180128
<SOS> `` have you no friends who could assist you ? '' <EOS>	107.26602298465644
<SOS> morrel smiled mournfully . <EOS>	53.72775145216095
<SOS> `` in business , sir , '' said he , `` one has no friends , only correspondents . '' <EOS>	72.38367401674682
<SOS> `` it is true , '' murmured the englishman ; `` then you have but one hope . '' <EOS>	72.53208583016965
<SOS> `` but one . '' <EOS>	58.293217258178636
<SOS> `` the last ? '' <EOS>	53.235464893038724
<SOS> `` the last . '' <EOS>	57.491522867258254
<SOS> `` so that if this fail `` `` i am ruined , completely ruined ! '' <EOS>	92.96465350769448
<SOS> `` as i was on my way here , a vessel was coming into port . '' <EOS>	111.03570076509621
<SOS> `` i know it , sir ; a young man , who still adheres to my fallen fortunes , passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house , in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me ; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship . '' <EOS>	47.83420050567115
<SOS> `` and it is not yours ? '' <EOS>	74.2106987230243
<SOS> `` no , she is a bordeaux vessel , la gironde ; she comes from india also ; but she is not mine . '' <EOS>	96.77303458306838

<SOS> `` shall i tell you plainly one thing , sir ? <EOS>	96.08188789445924

<SOS> uncertainty is still hope . '' <EOS>	74.09657243295459
<SOS> then in a low voice morrel added , `` this delay is not natural . <EOS>	82.75188471255109
<SOS> the pharaon left calcutta the < num > th of february ; she ought to have been here a month ago . '' <EOS>	82.57939542331381
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	115.44085353902257
<SOS> said the englishman . <EOS>	47.5388619657184
<SOS> `` what is the meaning of that noise ? '' <EOS>	82.12160337349961
<SOS> `` oh , my god ! '' <EOS>	59.362027546838156
<SOS> cried morrel , turning pale , `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	53.72814179079223
<SOS> a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily , and half stifled sobs . <EOS>	96.45208188629316
<SOS> morrel rose and advanced to the door ; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair . <EOS>	73.66138347734366
<SOS> the two men remained opposite one another , morrel trembling in every limb , the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity . <EOS>	86.68250226134597
<SOS> the noise had ceased ; but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise , and something must follow . <EOS>	76.70965713383683
<SOS> the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs ; and that the footsteps , which were those of several persons , stopped at the door . <EOS>	87.13624872422918
<SOS> a key was inserted in the lock of the first door , and the creaking of hinges was audible . <EOS>	116.91366064591485
<SOS> `` there are only two persons who have the key to that door , '' murmured morrel , `` cocles and julie . '' <EOS>	59.058544560229286
<SOS> at this instant the second door opened , and the young girl , her eyes bathed with tears , appeared . <EOS>	71.26420284080207
<SOS> morrel rose tremblingly , supporting himself by the arm of the chair . <EOS>	89.1681542426486
<SOS> he would have spoken , but his voice failed him . <EOS>	60.124889405588696
<SOS> `` oh , father ! '' <EOS>	95.28364706810159
<SOS> said she , clasping her hands , `` forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings . '' <EOS>	91.43646684739049
<SOS> morrel again changed color . <EOS>	110.76908062339623
<SOS> julie threw herself into his arms . <EOS>	67.76394319134256
<SOS> `` oh , father , father ! '' <EOS>	73.61084979228492
<SOS> murmured she , `` courage ! '' <EOS>	96.05278148644372
<SOS> `` the pharaon has gone down , then ? '' <EOS>	106.77437343669456
<SOS> said morrel in a hoarse voice . <EOS>	58.443427629003985
<SOS> the young girl did not speak ; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father 's breast . <EOS>	67.0956985215604
<SOS> `` and the crew ? '' <EOS>	107.28512839136229
<SOS> asked morrel . <EOS>	63.423603863746344
<SOS> `` saved , '' said the girl ; `` saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor . '' <EOS>	51.896602330024905
<SOS> morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude . <EOS>	73.77019101952824
<SOS> `` thanks , my god , '' said he , `` at least thou strikest but me alone . '' <EOS>	51.584267842447964
<SOS> a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman . <EOS>	48.45871160994834
<SOS> `` come in , come in , '' said morrel , `` for i presume you are all at the door . '' <EOS>	82.72709960120345
<SOS> scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly . <EOS>	72.05876342563316
<SOS> emmanuel followed her , and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors . <EOS>	75.68491826872925
<SOS> at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step ; then restrained himself , and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment . <EOS>	78.04183213213322
<SOS> madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers , julie still lay with her head on his shoulder , emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrel 's family and the sailors at the door . <EOS>	104.52434320710995
<SOS> `` how did this happen ? '' <EOS>	114.42741871911619
<SOS> said morrel . <EOS>	67.05455608723773
<SOS> `` draw nearer , penelon , '' said the young man , `` and tell us all about it . '' <EOS>	94.21486282144171
<SOS> an old seaman , bronzed by the tropical sun , advanced , twirling the remains of a hat between his hands . <EOS>	120.70571533738239
<SOS> `` good day , m. morrel , '' said he , as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening , and had just returned from aix or toulon . <EOS>	87.73441311490751
<SOS> `` good day , penelon , '' returned morrel , who could not refrain from smiling through his tears , `` where is the captain ? '' <EOS>	74.01804988899673
<SOS> `` the captain , m. morrel , he has stayed behind sick at palma ; but please god , it wo n't be much , and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty . '' <EOS>	85.68405783285574
<SOS> `` well , now tell your story , penelon . '' <EOS>	62.72691865700986
<SOS> < num > m penelon rolled his quid in his cheek , placed his hand before his mouth , turned his head , and sent a long jet of tobacco juice into the antechamber , advanced his foot , balanced himself , and began . <EOS>	60.95064003316062
<SOS> `` you see , m. morrel , '' said he , `` we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador , sailing with a fair breeze , south south west after a week 's calm , when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says , 'penelon , what do you think of those clouds coming up over there ? ' <EOS>	77.90295621118818
<SOS> i was just then looking at them myself . <EOS>	77.52416632992438
<SOS> 'what do i think , captain ? <EOS>	86.52479890559155
<SOS> why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do , and that they would not be so black if they did n't mean mischief . ' <EOS>	64.40933351638655
<SOS> 'that 's my opinion too , ' said the captain , 'and i 'll take precautions accordingly . <EOS>	82.6939683368612
<SOS> we are carrying too much canvas . <EOS>	87.21815033787257
<SOS> avast , there , all hands ! <EOS>	63.96467055742874
<SOS> take in the studding sails and stow the flying jib . ' <EOS>	51.27860611121022
<SOS> it was time ; the squall was on us , and the vessel began to heel . <EOS>	74.42632002755401
<SOS> 'ah , ' said the captain , 'we have still too much canvas set ; all hands lower the mainsail ! ' <EOS>	72.80018541211928
<SOS> five minutes after , it was down ; and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails . <EOS>	93.21574037239614
<SOS> 'well , penelon , ' said the captain , 'what makes you shake your head ? ' <EOS>	64.09470345043616
<SOS> 'why , ' i says , ' i still think you 've got too much on . ' <EOS>	93.59090517629409
<SOS> ' i think you 're right , ' answered he , 'we shall have a gale . ' <EOS>	56.860857943814025
<SOS> ' a gale ? <EOS>	78.17227211478537
<SOS> more than that , we shall have a tempest , or i do n't know what 's what . ' <EOS>	83.44605567227565
<SOS> you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon ; luckily the captain understood his business . <EOS>	50.07569687399451
<SOS> 'take in two reefs in the top sails , ' cried the captain ; 'let go the bowlin 's , haul the brace , lower the top gallant sails , haul out the reef tackles on the yards . ' '' <EOS>	110.62346797457643
<SOS> < num > m `` that was not enough for those latitudes , '' said the englishman ; `` i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker . '' <EOS>	94.38452957340621
<SOS> his firm , sonorous , and unexpected voice made everyone start . <EOS>	76.33954565439365
<SOS> penelon put his hand over his eyes , and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain . <EOS>	81.20010755907485
<SOS> `` we did better than that , sir , '' said the old sailor respectfully ; `` we put the helm up to run before the tempest ; ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles . '' <EOS>	76.35769427160595
<SOS> `` the vessel was very old to risk that , '' said the englishman . <EOS>	66.51731381496522
<SOS> `` eh , it was that that did the business ; after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak . <EOS>	45.49183959898723
<SOS> 'penelon , ' said the captain , ' i think we are sinking , give me the helm , and go down into the hold . ' <EOS>	73.6352404412214
<SOS> i gave him the helm , and descended ; there was already three feet of water . <EOS>	95.2783732774468
<SOS> 'all hands to the pumps ! ' <EOS>	54.63110036748969
<SOS> i shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in . <EOS>	59.23985611768591
<SOS> 'ah , ' said i , after four hours ' work , 'since we are sinking , let us sink ; we can die but once . ' <EOS>	73.5970111249756
<SOS> 'is that the example you set , penelon ? ' <EOS>	70.88968547869499
<SOS> cries the captain ; 'very well , wait a minute . ' <EOS>	96.21392905423764
<SOS> he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols . <EOS>	110.9609008669635
<SOS> ' i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump , ' said he . '' <EOS>	78.81639504961697
<SOS> `` well done ! '' <EOS>	61.16145300184883
<SOS> said the englishman . <EOS>	48.74146105217546
<SOS> < num > m `` there 's nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons , '' continued the sailor ; `` and during that time the wind had abated , and the sea gone down , but the water kept rising ; not much , only two inches an hour , but still it rose . <EOS>	60.38429851501857
<SOS> two inches an hour does not seem much , but in twelve hours that makes two feet , and three we had before , that makes five . <EOS>	91.86322988990453
<SOS> 'come , ' said the captain , 'we have done all in our power , and m. morrel will have nothing to reproach us with , we have tried to save the ship , let us now save ourselves . <EOS>	74.07810474876447

<SOS> now , '' continued penelon , `` you see , m. morrel , a sailor is attached to his ship , but still more to his life , so we did not wait to be told twice ; the more so , that the ship was sinking under us , and seemed to say , 'get along save yourselves . ' <EOS>	50.42004332848837
<SOS> we soon launched the boat , and all eight of us got into it . <EOS>	60.02992158918506
<SOS> the captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel ; so i took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then i jumped after him . <EOS>	94.75938581072124
<SOS> it was time , for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man of war . <EOS>	86.22950299546423
<SOS> ten minutes after she pitched forward , then the other way , spun round and round , and then good bye to the pharaon . <EOS>	64.07839996760737
<SOS> as for us , we were three days without anything to eat or drink , so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest , when we saw la gironde ; we made signals of distress , she perceived us , made for us , and took us all on board . <EOS>	71.19371619267456
<SOS> there now , m. morrel , that 's the whole truth , on the honor of a sailor ; is not it true , you fellows there ? '' <EOS>	49.69518910926778
<SOS> a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings . <EOS>	45.346267600158725
<SOS> `` well , well , '' said m. morrel , `` i know there was no one in fault but destiny . <EOS>	88.94310684939148

<SOS> `` well , then , three months , '' said penelon . <EOS>	53.19023086595489
<SOS> `` cocles , pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows , '' said morrel . <EOS>	85.71328137631792
<SOS> `` at another time , '' added he , `` i should have said , give them , besides , two hundred francs over as a present ; but times are changed , and the little money that remains to me is not my own , so do not think me mean on this account . '' <EOS>	74.30663530287424
<SOS> penelon turned to his companions , and exchanged a few words with them . <EOS>	106.42744410759322
<SOS> `` as for that , m. morrel , '' said he , again turning his quid , `` as for that `` `` as for what ? '' <EOS>	69.69680606768046

<SOS> cried morrel gratefully ; `` take it take it ; and if you can find another employer , enter his service ; you are free to do so . '' <EOS>	55.83957995693286
<SOS> these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman . <EOS>	66.04751298446455
<SOS> penelon nearly swallowed his quid ; fortunately he recovered . <EOS>	51.057611122168446

<SOS> `` i have no money to build ships with , penelon , '' said the poor owner mournfully , `` so i can not accept your kind offer . '' <EOS>	71.38050981183768
<SOS> `` no more money ? <EOS>	78.96626402144972

<SOS> the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten , and retired ; but , as she left the apartment , julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance , to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features . <EOS>	76.75520098097692
<SOS> the two men were left alone . <EOS>	72.50845478718749

<SOS> the bills were renewed , the old ones destroyed , and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources . <EOS>	86.91894929788162
<SOS> the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation ; and morrel , overwhelming him with grateful blessings , conducted him to the staircase . <EOS>	81.83633339452994
<SOS> the stranger met julie on the stairs ; she pretended to be descending , but in reality she was waiting for him . <EOS>	58.83946473236428
<SOS> `` oh , sir '' said she , clasping her hands . <EOS>	68.44842846751943
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , '' said the stranger , `` one day you will receive a letter signed 'sinbad the sailor . ' <EOS>	55.083122447031116
<SOS> do exactly what the letter bids you , however strange it may appear . '' <EOS>	80.15982846490974
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' returned julie . <EOS>	57.21700553092329
<SOS> `` do you promise ? '' <EOS>	84.36563800498843
<SOS> `` i swear to you i will . '' <EOS>	76.48952384454599
<SOS> `` it is well . <EOS>	76.26740481445562
<SOS> adieu , mademoiselle . <EOS>	78.34814892997552
<SOS> continue to be the good , sweet girl you are at present , and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband . '' <EOS>	70.09984913944805
<SOS> julie uttered a faint cry , blushed like a rose , and leaned against the baluster . <EOS>	63.129935465428346
<SOS> the stranger waved his hand , and continued to descend . <EOS>	42.08549690305294
<SOS> in the court he found penelon , who , with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand , seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them . <EOS>	68.7507001955697
<SOS> `` come with me , my friend , '' said the englishman ; `` i wish to speak to you . '' <EOS>	98.77089581234544
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	71.66221215723974
<SOS> the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson & french , at the moment when morrel expected it least , was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him . <EOS>	64.20784581127477
<SOS> the same day he told his wife , emmanuel , and his daughter all that had occurred ; and a ray of hope , if not of tranquillity , returned to the family . <EOS>	51.58246822323388
<SOS> unfortunately , however , morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson & french , who had shown themselves so considerate towards him ; and , as he had said , in business he had correspondents , and not friends . <EOS>	40.62170081605318
<SOS> when he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson & french towards him ; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this : `` we had better help a man who owes us nearly < num > , < num > francs , and have those < num > , < num > francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again . '' <EOS>	66.96280065244468
<SOS> unfortunately , whether through envy or stupidity , all morrel 's correspondents did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision . <EOS>	90.88346606848752
<SOS> the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude , and , thanks to the delay granted by the englishman , were paid by cocles with equal punctuality . <EOS>	93.3750725173268
<SOS> cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity . <EOS>	74.78057724610964
<SOS> it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm , that if he had to repay on the < num > th the < num > , < num > francs of m. de boville , and on the < num > th the < num > , < num > francs of bills , for which , as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons , he had time granted , he must be a ruined man . <EOS>	56.68178316339622
<SOS> the opinion of all the commercial men was that , under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel , it was impossible for him to remain solvent . <EOS>	80.4063628061174
<SOS> great , therefore , was the astonishment when at the end of the month , he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality . <EOS>	101.06979197509341
<SOS> still confidence was not restored to all minds , and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month . <EOS>	89.09145755706297
<SOS> the month passed , and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources . <EOS>	87.92863724943844
<SOS> formerly his paper , at any date , was taken with confidence , and was even in request . <EOS>	96.21928885198813
<SOS> morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only , and none of the banks would give him credit . <EOS>	93.64162726101232
<SOS> fortunately , morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely ; and , as they reached him , he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came . <EOS>	63.99906886302388
<SOS> the agent of thomson & french had not been again seen at marseilles ; the day after , or two days after his visit to morrel , he had disappeared ; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor , the inspector of prisons , and m. morrel , his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons . <EOS>	75.46064217019313
<SOS> as to the sailors of the pharaon , they must have found snug berths elsewhere , for they also had disappeared . <EOS>	60.05653619754599
<SOS> captain gaumard , recovered from his illness , had returned from palma . <EOS>	95.56918259840029
<SOS> he delayed presenting himself at morrel 's , but the owner , hearing of his arrival , went to see him . <EOS>	89.12991996508173
<SOS> the worthy shipowner knew , from penelon 's recital , of the captain 's brave conduct during the storm , and tried to console him . <EOS>	108.63045579155818
<SOS> he brought him also the amount of his wages , which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for . <EOS>	92.60803952650545
<SOS> as he descended the staircase , morrel met penelon , who was going up . <EOS>	66.12699183896078
<SOS> penelon had , it would seem , made good use of his money , for he was newly clad . <EOS>	58.79439947795795
<SOS> when he saw his employer , the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed , drew on one side into the corner of the landing place , passed his quid from one cheek to the other , stared stupidly with his great eyes , and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return . <EOS>	77.61683111706832
<SOS> morrel attributed penelon 's embarrassment to the elegance of his attire ; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account ; he was , no doubt , engaged on board some other vessel , and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having , if we may so express ourselves , worn mourning for the pharaon longer . <EOS>	56.03211262811702
<SOS> perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck , and to offer him employment from his new master . <EOS>	62.51230233539155
<SOS> `` worthy fellows ! '' <EOS>	53.70332252910038
<SOS> said morrel , as he went away , `` may your new master love you as i loved you , and be more fortunate than i have been ! '' <EOS>	75.65767474990375
<SOS> < num > m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old . <EOS>	112.59840949747546
<SOS> on the < num > th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach , and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month , and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel , and his cashier cocles , to meet the creditors . <EOS>	73.10194874656464
<SOS> but , contrary to all expectation , when the < num > st of august came , the house opened as usual , and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter , examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny , and , from first to last , paid all with the usual precision . <EOS>	65.04813413843226
<SOS> there came in , moreover , two drafts which m. morrel had fully anticipated , and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted . <EOS>	70.96099932104379
<SOS> all this was incomprehensible , and then , with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news , the failure was put off until the end of september . <EOS>	59.452302644680614
<SOS> on the < num > st , morrel returned ; he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety , for from this journey to paris they hoped great things . <EOS>	82.64209948022348
<SOS> morrel had thought of danglars , who was now immensely rich , and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days , since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker , with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth . <EOS>	84.01591120740575
<SOS> it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs , and had unlimited credit . <EOS>	84.20086410501483
<SOS> danglars , then , without taking a crown from his pocket , could save morrel ; he had but to pass his word for a loan , and morrel was saved . <EOS>	120.30912980019359
<SOS> morrel had long thought of danglars , but had kept away from some instinctive motive , and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource . <EOS>	62.121558219286925
<SOS> and morrel was right , for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal . <EOS>	68.14382295334426
<SOS> yet , on his arrival , morrel did not utter a complaint , or say one harsh word . <EOS>	40.36161264690605
<SOS> he embraced his weeping wife and daughter , pressed emmanuel 's hand with friendly warmth , and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles . <EOS>	82.86475681859821
<SOS> `` then , '' said the two women to emmanuel , `` we are indeed ruined . '' <EOS>	65.27520892973877
<SOS> it was agreed in a brief council held among them , that julie should write to her brother , who was in garrison at nîmes , to come to them as speedily as possible . <EOS>	91.42024177759275
<SOS> the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended . <EOS>	69.49163716413746
<SOS> besides , maximilian morrel , though hardly two and twenty , had great influence over his father . <EOS>	104.52151277813647
<SOS> he was a strong minded , upright young man . <EOS>	72.77370881458386
<SOS> at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him , but had consulted young maximilian 's taste . <EOS>	70.47821929719038
<SOS> he had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school , and left it as sub lieutenant of the < num > rd of the line . <EOS>	58.22981851423047
<SOS> for a year he had held this rank , and expected promotion on the first vacancy . <EOS>	55.46050717977041
<SOS> in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance , not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier , but also of the duties of a man ; and he thus gained the name of `` the stoic . '' <EOS>	79.37105007923164
<SOS> we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it , and did not even know what it meant . <EOS>	62.49230020409489
<SOS> this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure . <EOS>	63.53597036900274
<SOS> they had not mistaken the gravity of this event , for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles , julie saw the latter leave it pale , trembling , and his features betraying the utmost consternation . <EOS>	97.62946153671619
<SOS> she would have questioned him as he passed by her , but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation , and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed : `` oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle , what a dreadful misfortune ! <EOS>	77.9377193950622
<SOS> who could ever have believed it ! '' <EOS>	99.77958247708331
<SOS> a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers , a portfolio , and a bag of money . <EOS>	78.96970358909554
<SOS> morrel examined the ledgers , opened the portfolio , and counted the money . <EOS>	82.58532206597937
<SOS> all his funds amounted to < num > , < num > or < num > , < num > francs , his bills receivable up to the < num > th to < num > , < num > or < num > , < num > , which , making the best of everything , gave him < num > , < num > francs to meet debts amounting to < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	111.55176370294981
<SOS> he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account . <EOS>	67.30308650904742
<SOS> however , when morrel went down to his dinner , he appeared very calm . <EOS>	70.1640323325286
<SOS> this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been . <EOS>	106.89302461938118
<SOS> after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens , and read the semaphore ; this day he did not leave the house , but returned to his office . <EOS>	90.12920184273655
<SOS> as to cocles , he seemed completely bewildered . <EOS>	78.03135087391405
<SOS> for part of the day he went into the courtyard , seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun . <EOS>	57.2535983227021
<SOS> emmanuel tried to comfort the women , but his eloquence faltered . <EOS>	56.36799279125766
<SOS> the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house , not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family . <EOS>	72.19476796224262
<SOS> night came , the two women had watched , hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them , but they heard him pass before their door , and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps . <EOS>	90.64160006195435
<SOS> they listened ; he went into his sleeping room , and fastened the door inside . <EOS>	52.853299883937815
<SOS> madame morrel sent her daughter to bed , and half an hour after julie had retired , she rose , took off her shoes , and went stealthily along the passage , to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing . <EOS>	74.79443333951413
<SOS> in the passage she saw a retreating shadow ; it was julie , who , uneasy herself , had anticipated her mother . <EOS>	43.545059678907094
<SOS> the young lady went towards madame morrel . <EOS>	77.42017955501888
<SOS> `` he is writing , '' she said . <EOS>	52.52365894378338
<SOS> they had understood each other without speaking . <EOS>	72.7629472446496
<SOS> madame morrel looked again through the keyhole , morrel was writing ; but madame morrel remarked , what her daughter had not observed , that her husband was writing on stamped paper . <EOS>	70.70684999463933
<SOS> the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her ; she shuddered , and yet had not strength to utter a word . <EOS>	65.85945681124782
<SOS> next day m. morrel seemed as calm as ever , went into his office as usual , came to his breakfast punctually , and then , after dinner , he placed his daughter beside him , took her head in his arms , and held her for a long time against his bosom . <EOS>	70.56482700232155
<SOS> in the evening , julie told her mother , that although he was apparently so calm , she had noticed that her father 's heart beat violently . <EOS>	70.28990082130623
<SOS> the next two days passed in much the same way . <EOS>	55.473112625040656
<SOS> on the evening of the < num > th of september , m. morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study . <EOS>	112.36396848887156
<SOS> julie trembled at this request , which seemed to her of bad omen . <EOS>	61.757481733338025
<SOS> why did her father ask for this key which she always kept , and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment ? <EOS>	95.63881122086676
<SOS> the young girl looked at morrel . <EOS>	69.49642877685503
<SOS> `` what have i done wrong , father , '' she said , `` that you should take this key from me ? '' <EOS>	53.14659216131898
<SOS> `` nothing , my dear , '' replied the unhappy man , the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question , `` nothing , only i want it . '' <EOS>	95.43725315485008
<SOS> julie made a pretence to feel for the key . <EOS>	80.80565748555603
<SOS> `` i must have left it in my room , '' she said . <EOS>	64.21577691714386
<SOS> and she went out , but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel . <EOS>	67.83835802175508
<SOS> `` do not give this key to your father , '' said he , `` and tomorrow morning , if possible , do not quit him for a moment . '' <EOS>	83.88315969166804
<SOS> she questioned emmanuel , but he knew nothing , or would not say what he knew . <EOS>	103.01629694600838
<SOS> during the night , between the < num > th and < num > th of september , madame morrel remained listening for every sound , and , until three o'clock in the morning , she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation . <EOS>	70.30643438094701
<SOS> it was three o'clock when he threw himself on the bed . <EOS>	50.42767301027612
<SOS> the mother and daughter passed the night together . <EOS>	83.43521951527406
<SOS> they had expected maximilian since the previous evening . <EOS>	96.03934154320945
<SOS> at eight o'clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber . <EOS>	114.59180391616243
<SOS> he was calm ; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage . <EOS>	87.14767860667465
<SOS> they did not dare to ask him how he had slept . <EOS>	68.21380927983489
<SOS> morrel was kinder to his wife , more affectionate to his daughter , than he had ever been . <EOS>	110.13462190919638
<SOS> he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl . <EOS>	95.91883810066072
<SOS> julie , mindful of emmanuel 's request , was following her father when he quitted the room , but he said to her quickly : `` remain with your mother , dearest . '' <EOS>	98.81840457079616
<SOS> julie wished to accompany him . <EOS>	95.36681678117746
<SOS> `` i wish you to do so , '' said he . <EOS>	57.84107436801733
<SOS> this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken , but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness , and julie did not dare to disobey . <EOS>	87.2875553187336
<SOS> she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless . <EOS>	90.46748745604289
<SOS> an instant afterwards the door opened , she felt two arms encircle her , and a mouth pressed her forehead . <EOS>	54.98727238163646
<SOS> she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy . <EOS>	62.2177929316921
<SOS> < num > m `` maximilian , my dearest brother ! '' <EOS>	56.96882364916419
<SOS> she cried . <EOS>	74.67396035450558
<SOS> at these words madame morrel rose , and threw herself into her son 's arms . <EOS>	68.13600261968085
<SOS> `` mother , '' said the young man , looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter , `` what has occurred what has happened ? <EOS>	65.75781028033276
<SOS> your letter has frightened me , and i have come hither with all speed . '' <EOS>	102.02527707246978
<SOS> `` julie , '' said madame morrel , making a sign to the young man , `` go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived . '' <EOS>	46.41579419435865
<SOS> the young lady rushed out of the apartment , but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand . <EOS>	119.30658837318657
<SOS> `` are you not mademoiselle julie morrel ? '' <EOS>	58.72204278521335
<SOS> inquired the man , with a strong italian accent . <EOS>	84.77756959674045
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied julie with hesitation ; `` what is your pleasure ? <EOS>	62.84829745478824
<SOS> i do not know you . '' <EOS>	118.02552404781969
<SOS> `` read this letter , '' he said , handing it to her . <EOS>	115.6329005465788
<SOS> julie hesitated . <EOS>	92.28588634062609
<SOS> `` it concerns the best interests of your father , '' said the messenger . <EOS>	102.65116428722347
<SOS> the young girl hastily took the letter from him . <EOS>	84.94392434682582
<SOS> she opened it quickly and read : `` go this moment to the allées de meilhan , enter the house no . <EOS>	38.82312573287633
<SOS> < num > , ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor , enter the apartment , take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk , and give it to your father . <EOS>	92.73090768514419
<SOS> it is important that he should receive it before eleven o'clock . <EOS>	71.5754233611578
<SOS> you promised to obey me implicitly . <EOS>	77.56337905343176
<SOS> remember your oath . <EOS>	73.9887918894057
<SOS> `` sinbad the sailor . '' <EOS>	73.40905583094695
<SOS> the young girl uttered a joyful cry , raised her eyes , looked round to question the messenger , but he had disappeared . <EOS>	67.59320113681956
<SOS> she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time , and saw there was a postscript . <EOS>	77.95391052873683
<SOS> she read : `` it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone . <EOS>	70.16974711951416
<SOS> if you go accompanied by any other person , or should anyone else go in your place , the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it . '' <EOS>	80.871567940063
<SOS> this postscript decreased greatly the young girl 's happiness . <EOS>	74.45673392085973
<SOS> was there nothing to fear ? <EOS>	90.48628559658334
<SOS> was there not some snare laid for her ? <EOS>	111.51544444568445
<SOS> her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age . <EOS>	73.30490600473487
<SOS> but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it ; indeed , it may be observed , that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror . <EOS>	84.81093876493934
<SOS> julie hesitated , and resolved to take counsel . <EOS>	82.93728167634671
<SOS> yet , through a singular impulse , it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied , but to emmanuel . <EOS>	57.16596107276983
<SOS> she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson & french had come to her father 's , related the scene on the staircase , repeated the promise she had made , and showed him the letter . <EOS>	62.8177001417023
<SOS> `` you must go , then , mademoiselle , '' said emmanuel . <EOS>	69.45821356713638
<SOS> `` go there ? '' <EOS>	61.22270324508617
<SOS> murmured julie . <EOS>	61.552533501154194
<SOS> `` yes ; i will accompany you . '' <EOS>	72.061145883247
<SOS> `` but did you not read that i must be alone ? '' <EOS>	66.95936760239195
<SOS> said julie . <EOS>	84.47147471787426
<SOS> `` and you shall be alone , '' replied the young man . <EOS>	73.36732271421583
<SOS> `` i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée , and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy , i will hasten to rejoin you , and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me ! '' <EOS>	60.79635894647632
<SOS> `` then , emmanuel ? '' <EOS>	56.617773810455574
<SOS> said the young girl with hesitation , `` it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation ? '' <EOS>	97.50938737524093
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	57.55560732022689
<SOS> did not the messenger say your father 's safety depended upon it ? '' <EOS>	57.79414297486473
<SOS> `` but what danger threatens him , then , emmanuel ? '' <EOS>	58.6241765203688
<SOS> she asked . <EOS>	64.0904783880669
<SOS> emmanuel hesitated a moment , but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply . <EOS>	73.09094476546346
<SOS> `` listen , '' he said ; `` today is the < num > th of september , is it not ? '' <EOS>	81.11420415085416
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	93.96891627876
<SOS> `` today , then , at eleven o'clock , your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay ? '' <EOS>	66.58304278090071
<SOS> `` yes , we know that . '' <EOS>	89.57722622032334
<SOS> `` well , then , '' continued emmanuel , `` we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house . '' <EOS>	80.13038612034293
<SOS> `` what will happen then ? '' <EOS>	58.544023321737775
<SOS> `` why , if today before eleven o'clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid , he will be compelled at twelve o'clock to declare himself a bankrupt . '' <EOS>	74.80965274055878
<SOS> `` oh , come , then , come ! '' <EOS>	87.655749425298
<SOS> cried she , hastening away with the young man . <EOS>	76.30245221218847
<SOS> during this time , madame morrel had told her son everything . <EOS>	41.01405038349311
<SOS> the young man knew quite well that , after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father , great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping ; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point . <EOS>	41.07030993908997
<SOS> he was thunderstruck . <EOS>	105.72067918320144
<SOS> then , rushing hastily out of the apartment , he ran upstairs , expecting to find his father in his study , but he rapped there in vain . <EOS>	102.46194809895462
<SOS> while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open , turned , and saw his father . <EOS>	101.3446238592506
<SOS> instead of going direct to his study , m. morrel had returned to his bedchamber , which he was only this moment quitting . <EOS>	67.43898875057482
<SOS> morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son , of whose arrival he was ignorant . <EOS>	75.98846633371825
<SOS> he remained motionless on the spot , pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat . <EOS>	71.26453373938436
<SOS> maximilian sprang down the staircase , and threw his arms round his father 's neck ; but suddenly he recoiled , and placed his right hand on morrel 's breast . <EOS>	61.24277705190931
<SOS> `` father , '' he exclaimed , turning pale as death , `` what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat ? '' <EOS>	90.30013943188631
<SOS> `` oh , this is what i feared ! '' <EOS>	102.44021432618018
<SOS> said morrel . <EOS>	70.05969368391867
<SOS> `` father , father , in heaven 's name , '' exclaimed the young man , `` what are these weapons for ? '' <EOS>	70.75212273164621
<SOS> `` maximilian , '' replied morrel , looking fixedly at his son , `` you are a man , and a man of honor . <EOS>	104.86383808962773
<SOS> come , and i will explain to you . '' <EOS>	60.53006307113999
<SOS> and with a firm step morrel went up to his study , while maximilian followed him , trembling as he went . <EOS>	54.14649759002142
<SOS> morrel opened the door , and closed it behind his son ; then , crossing the anteroom , went to his desk on which he placed the pistols , and pointed with his finger to an open ledger . <EOS>	69.72000234025177
<SOS> in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs . <EOS>	103.17608508939443
<SOS> morrel had to pay , within half an hour , < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	65.80033522317558
<SOS> all he possessed was < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	56.44232958432052
<SOS> `` read ! '' <EOS>	68.08349466066126
<SOS> said morrel . <EOS>	60.35891452808949
<SOS> the young man was overwhelmed as he read . <EOS>	87.21931334178603
<SOS> morrel said not a word . <EOS>	84.44762977056277
<SOS> what could he say ? <EOS>	96.21013661378555
<SOS> what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures ? <EOS>	73.06984413850604
<SOS> `` and have you done all that is possible , father , to meet this disastrous result ? '' <EOS>	83.40630741983038
<SOS> asked the young man , after a moment 's pause . <EOS>	71.4403950811209
<SOS> `` i have , '' replied morrel . <EOS>	73.69186987375065
<SOS> `` you have no money coming in on which you can rely ? '' <EOS>	66.15483384846806
<SOS> `` none . '' <EOS>	55.18959799876188
<SOS> `` you have exhausted every resource ? '' <EOS>	47.71902294853712
<SOS> `` all . '' <EOS>	101.31722788799595
<SOS> `` and in half an hour , '' said maximilian in a gloomy voice , `` our name is dishonored ! '' <EOS>	59.85857618257382
<SOS> `` blood washes out dishonor , '' said morrel . <EOS>	80.31105706375912
<SOS> `` you are right , father ; i understand you . '' <EOS>	112.09423221813084
<SOS> then extending his hand towards one of the pistols , he said , `` there is one for you and one for me thanks ! '' <EOS>	47.879835309540056
<SOS> morrel caught his hand . <EOS>	53.405481130089065
<SOS> `` your mother your sister ! <EOS>	77.34778141615584
<SOS> who will support them ? '' <EOS>	66.74789915265853
<SOS> a shudder ran through the young man 's frame . <EOS>	81.22690520810254
<SOS> `` father , '' he said , `` do you reflect that you are bidding me to live ? '' <EOS>	97.00920647328154
<SOS> `` yes , i do so bid you , '' answered morrel , `` it is your duty . <EOS>	44.76999144072637
<SOS> you have a calm , strong mind , maximilian . <EOS>	107.47479373663347
<SOS> maximilian , you are no ordinary man . <EOS>	114.93506481199653
<SOS> i make no requests or commands ; i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own , and then judge for yourself . '' <EOS>	61.34756882261163
<SOS> the young man reflected for a moment , then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes , and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets , the insignia of his rank . <EOS>	73.55533971128388
<SOS> `` be it so , then , my father , '' he said , extending his hand to morrel , `` die in peace , my father ; i will live . '' <EOS>	75.66252973094763
<SOS> morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son , but maximilian caught him in his arms , and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment . <EOS>	74.33048553933394
<SOS> `` you know it is not my fault , '' said morrel . <EOS>	72.16848958253031
<SOS> < num > m maximilian smiled . <EOS>	45.40112608650272
<SOS> `` i know , father , you are the most honorable man i have ever known . '' <EOS>	54.21291894645986
<SOS> `` good , my son . <EOS>	87.82479569124152
<SOS> and now there is no more to be said ; go and rejoin your mother and sister . '' <EOS>	47.75630567692461
<SOS> `` my father , '' said the young man , bending his knee , `` bless me ! '' <EOS>	107.13972190746716
<SOS> morrel took the head of his son between his two hands , drew him forward , and kissing his forehead several times said : `` oh , yes , yes , i bless you in my own name , and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men , who say through me , 'the edifice which misfortune has destroyed , providence may build up again . ' <EOS>	71.5132414805189
<SOS> on seeing me die such a death , the most inexorable will have pity on you . <EOS>	97.17662073445796
<SOS> to you , perhaps , they will accord the time they have refused to me . <EOS>	86.15839939181926
<SOS> then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor . <EOS>	67.22787402992977
<SOS> go to work , labor , young man , struggle ardently and courageously ; live , yourself , your mother and sister , with the most rigid economy , so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify . <EOS>	41.83245731173979
<SOS> reflect how glorious a day it will be , how grand , how solemn , that day of complete restoration , on which you will say in this very office , 'my father died because he could not do what i have this day done ; but he died calmly and peaceably , because in dying he knew what i should do . ' '' <EOS>	74.01141777098435
<SOS> `` my father , my father ! '' <EOS>	65.12065915894964
<SOS> cried the young man , `` why should you not live ? '' <EOS>	61.27609028467066
<SOS> `` if i live , all would be changed ; if i live , interest would be converted into doubt , pity into hostility ; if i live i am only a man who has broken his word , failed in his engagements in fact , only a bankrupt . <EOS>	72.53373958313153
<SOS> if , on the contrary , i die , remember , maximilian , my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man . <EOS>	59.61660225324681
<SOS> living , my best friends would avoid my house ; dead , all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home . <EOS>	64.56138765458961
<SOS> living , you would feel shame at my name ; dead , you may raise your head and say , ' i am the son of him you killed , because , for the first time , he has been compelled to break his word . ' '' <EOS>	64.57685313555442
<SOS> the young man uttered a groan , but appeared resigned . <EOS>	82.14780261726712
<SOS> `` and now , '' said morrel , `` leave me alone , and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away . '' <EOS>	81.23381772983085
<SOS> `` will you not see my sister once more ? '' <EOS>	87.27390831456465
<SOS> asked maximilian . <EOS>	60.09383772255961
<SOS> a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview , and therefore he had suggested it . <EOS>	57.60747922431922
<SOS> morrel shook his head . <EOS>	77.78700254836961
<SOS> `` i saw her this morning , and bade her adieu . '' <EOS>	72.64569871612154
<SOS> `` have you no particular commands to leave with me , my father ? '' <EOS>	75.38101345342075
<SOS> inquired maximilian in a faltering voice . <EOS>	80.72570968223387
<SOS> `` yes ; my son , and a sacred command . '' <EOS>	120.1287287234401
<SOS> `` say it , my father . '' <EOS>	64.80583986846243
<SOS> `` the house of thomson & french is the only one who , from humanity , or , it may be , selfishness it is not for me to read men 's hearts has had any pity for me . <EOS>	61.24840299234132
<SOS> its agent , who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of < num > , < num > francs , i will not say granted , but offered me three months . <EOS>	91.84631930203268
<SOS> let this house be the first repaid , my son , and respect this man . '' <EOS>	60.54032202173724
<SOS> `` father , i will , '' said maximilian . <EOS>	92.65520906115246
<SOS> `` and now , once more , adieu , '' said morrel . <EOS>	65.57906764598582
<SOS> `` go , leave me ; i would be alone . <EOS>	70.56517250343526
<SOS> you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom . '' <EOS>	53.29700014044398
<SOS> the young man remained standing and motionless , having but the force of will and not the power of execution . <EOS>	66.02127954269544
<SOS> `` hear me , maximilian , '' said his father . <EOS>	42.68460492370689
<SOS> `` suppose i were a soldier like you , and ordered to carry a certain redoubt , and you knew i must be killed in the assault , would you not say to me , as you said just now , 'go , father ; for you are dishonored by delay , and death is preferable to shame ! ' '' <EOS>	98.17233631882858
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said the young man , `` yes ; '' and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure , he said , `` be it so , my father . '' <EOS>	102.98625790686106
<SOS> and he rushed out of the study . <EOS>	70.02502051211256
<SOS> when his son had left him , morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door ; then putting forth his arm , he pulled the bell . <EOS>	78.62468342031319
<SOS> after a moment 's interval , cocles appeared . <EOS>	63.12174378349672
<SOS> it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him . <EOS>	68.39411232545216
<SOS> this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done . <EOS>	87.56171139633723
<SOS> `` my worthy cocles , '' said morrel in a tone impossible to describe , `` do you remain in the antechamber . <EOS>	50.24519831427036
<SOS> when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson & french arrives , announce his arrival to me . '' <EOS>	78.02340853450977
<SOS> cocles made no reply ; he made a sign with his head , went into the anteroom , and seated himself . <EOS>	55.684884913510906
<SOS> morrel fell back in his chair , his eyes fixed on the clock ; there were seven minutes left , that was all . <EOS>	62.283130489532006
<SOS> the hand moved on with incredible rapidity , he seemed to see its motion . <EOS>	93.97141531708208
<SOS> what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words . <EOS>	70.46252075306782
<SOS> he was still comparatively young , he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family , but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning , illogical perhaps , yet certainly plausible , that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world , even life itself . <EOS>	45.07680628977186
<SOS> to form the slightest idea of his feelings , one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven . <EOS>	77.97203355405365
<SOS> the minute hand moved on . <EOS>	61.637232872749564
<SOS> the pistols were loaded ; he stretched forth his hand , took one up , and murmured his daughter 's name . <EOS>	100.56000093151096
<SOS> then he laid it down , seized his pen , and wrote a few words . <EOS>	97.51810911586934
<SOS> it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter . <EOS>	65.50660974959914
<SOS> then he turned again to the clock , counting time now not by minutes , but by seconds . <EOS>	85.27790733598653
<SOS> he took up the deadly weapon again , his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock , and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol . <EOS>	80.71356635436129
<SOS> at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow , a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings . <EOS>	59.16344215015477
<SOS> he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened . <EOS>	71.34862198369032
<SOS> morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles , `` the agent of thomson & french . '' <EOS>	50.39478610931018
<SOS> he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth . <EOS>	112.7355057976475
<SOS> suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter 's voice . <EOS>	66.03624563303319
<SOS> he turned and saw julie . <EOS>	104.52679721135455
<SOS> the pistol fell from his hands . <EOS>	68.88089198757054
<SOS> `` my father ! '' <EOS>	88.59902099851422
<SOS> cried the young girl , out of breath , and half dead with joy `` saved , you are saved ! '' <EOS>	55.81181023050513
<SOS> and she threw herself into his arms , holding in her extended hand a red , netted silk purse . <EOS>	65.99178100312899
<SOS> < num > m `` saved , my child ! '' <EOS>	96.67989702205479
<SOS> said morrel ; `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	112.52229021514687
<SOS> `` yes , saved saved ! <EOS>	78.79118517810741
<SOS> see , see ! '' <EOS>	54.10997390088158
<SOS> said the young girl . <EOS>	49.33872605305923
<SOS> morrel took the purse , and started as he did so , for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself . <EOS>	82.61744319367985
<SOS> at one end was the receipted bill for the < num > , < num > francs , and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut , with these words on a small slip of parchment : julie 's dowry . <EOS>	72.69855127265001
<SOS> morrel passed his hand over his brow ; it seemed to him a dream . <EOS>	50.415002050737975
<SOS> at this moment the clock struck eleven . <EOS>	46.53501797677223
<SOS> he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart . <EOS>	69.01984487707333
<SOS> `` explain , my child , '' he said , `` explain , my child , '' he said , `` explain where did you find this purse ? '' <EOS>	77.94975893052647
<SOS> `` in a house in the allées de meilhan , no . <EOS>	48.43393950512072
<SOS> < num > , on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor . '' <EOS>	105.73973941687345
<SOS> `` but , '' cried morrel , `` this purse is not yours ! '' <EOS>	70.66692144526186
<SOS> julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning . <EOS>	80.23366354206688
<SOS> `` and did you go alone ? '' <EOS>	65.23796861823462
<SOS> asked morrel , after he had read it . <EOS>	75.39097856555492
<SOS> `` emmanuel accompanied me , father . <EOS>	86.84758341110724
<SOS> he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée , but , strange to say , he was not there when i returned . '' <EOS>	96.43757885379557
<SOS> `` monsieur morrel ! '' <EOS>	80.127977486208
<SOS> exclaimed a voice on the stairs ; `` monsieur morrel ! '' <EOS>	42.56749039868682
<SOS> `` it is his voice ! '' <EOS>	74.32817892802898
<SOS> said julie . <EOS>	56.25102546286261
<SOS> at this moment emmanuel entered , his countenance full of animation and joy . <EOS>	74.38077145523395
<SOS> `` the pharaon ! '' <EOS>	54.495017108415404
<SOS> he cried ; `` the pharaon ! '' <EOS>	66.38579456705887
<SOS> `` what ! <EOS>	50.590732673901854
<SOS> what ! <EOS>	70.77502713155864
<SOS> the pharaon ! <EOS>	72.75256730343798
<SOS> are you mad , emmanuel ? <EOS>	87.22357073445687
<SOS> you know the vessel is lost . '' <EOS>	41.566477439323336
<SOS> `` the pharaon , sir they signal the pharaon ! <EOS>	59.23314209789528
<SOS> the pharaon is entering the harbor ! '' <EOS>	47.755633798092816
<SOS> morrel fell back in his chair , his strength was failing him ; his understanding weakened by such events , refused to comprehend such incredible , unheard of , fabulous facts . <EOS>	76.80479200584315
<SOS> but his son came in . <EOS>	56.95863601950949
<SOS> `` father , '' cried maximilian , `` how could you say the pharaon was lost ? <EOS>	62.04052571726907

<SOS> impossible , impossible ! '' <EOS>	53.29220434974192
<SOS> but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand , the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond . <EOS>	72.81580903342913
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' exclaimed cocles , `` what can it mean ? <EOS>	68.87332784644961

<SOS> `` come , dear ones , '' said morrel , rising from his seat , `` let us go and see , and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence ! '' <EOS>	61.28396051924602
<SOS> they all went out , and on the stairs met madame morrel , who had been afraid to go up into the study . <EOS>	95.03237289248668
<SOS> in a moment they were at the canebière . <EOS>	83.08325999536797
<SOS> there was a crowd on the pier . <EOS>	91.38860225890171
<SOS> all the crowd gave way before morrel . <EOS>	108.41858963598541
<SOS> `` the pharaon ! <EOS>	47.9962709309773
<SOS> the pharaon ! '' <EOS>	73.67883437496329
<SOS> said every voice . <EOS>	61.456141197462976
<SOS> and , wonderful to see , in front of the tower of saint jean , was a ship bearing on her stern these words , printed in white letters , `` the pharaon , morrel & son , of marseilles . '' <EOS>	70.84512763129062
<SOS> she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon , and loaded , as that had been , with cochineal and indigo . <EOS>	113.47379561591325
<SOS> she cast anchor , clued up sails , and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders , and good old penelon making signals to m. morrel . <EOS>	81.6673905046619
<SOS> to doubt any longer was impossible ; there was the evidence of the senses , and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony . <EOS>	105.51396978401115
<SOS> as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head , in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event , a man , with his face half covered by a black beard , and who , concealed behind the sentry box , watched the scene with delight , uttered these words in a low tone : `` be happy , noble heart , be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter , and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds . '' <EOS>	58.04681180620948
<SOS> < num > m and with a smile expressive of supreme content , he left his hiding place , and without being observed , descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation , and hailing three times , shouted `` jacopo , jacopo , jacopo ! '' <EOS>	69.9244781650559
<SOS> then a launch came to shore , took him on board , and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up , on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor ; thence he once again looked towards morrel , who , weeping with joy , was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him , and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies . <EOS>	79.79676907212574
<SOS> `` and now , '' said the unknown , `` farewell kindness , humanity , and gratitude ! <EOS>	71.52283616319139
<SOS> farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart ! <EOS>	80.95310442249603
<SOS> i have been heaven 's substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked ! '' <EOS>	80.0897287272683
<SOS> at these words he gave a signal , and , as if only awaiting this signal , the yacht instantly put out to sea . <EOS>	74.12098035019986
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	66.98712586888207
<SOS> italy : sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year < num > , two young men belonging to the first society of paris , the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d'épinay , were at florence . <EOS>	68.62675369785612
<SOS> they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year , and that franz , who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy , should act as cicerone to albert . <EOS>	86.47915725628515
<SOS> as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome , especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo , or the campo vaccino , they wrote to signor pastrini , the proprietor of the hôtel de londres , piazza di spagna , to reserve comfortable apartments for them . <EOS>	88.92934787002159
<SOS> signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor , which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem . <EOS>	53.144885811180096
<SOS> they accepted his offer ; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left , albert started for naples . <EOS>	93.94249914474287
<SOS> as for franz , he remained at florence , and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine , and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility , he took a fancy into his head ( having already visited corsica , the cradle of bonaparte ) to visit elba , the waiting place of napoleon . <EOS>	63.0483464400246
<SOS> one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , `` to the island of elba ! '' <EOS>	61.00242987763192
<SOS> the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo . <EOS>	77.03032775038538
<SOS> he traversed the island , after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left , and re embarked for marciana . <EOS>	67.98805978984201
<SOS> two hours after he again landed at pianosa , where he was assured that red partridges abounded . <EOS>	107.75193100677826
<SOS> the sport was bad ; franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges , and , like every unsuccessful sportsman , he returned to the boat very much out of temper . <EOS>	64.56606132125401
<SOS> `` ah , if your excellency chose , '' said the captain , `` you might have capital sport . '' <EOS>	51.39942146191233
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	52.50251587691707
<SOS> `` do you see that island ? '' <EOS>	106.41440805361034
<SOS> continued the captain , pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea . <EOS>	76.82771872549768
<SOS> `` well , what is this island ? '' <EOS>	74.17409188536588
<SOS> `` the island of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	101.30706326302919
<SOS> `` but i have no permission to shoot over this island . '' <EOS>	94.49623173346231
<SOS> `` your excellency does not require a permit , for the island is uninhabited . '' <EOS>	73.46130457867052
<SOS> `` ah , indeed ! '' <EOS>	77.39990536774357
<SOS> said the young man . <EOS>	43.603602488819625
<SOS> `` a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity . '' <EOS>	101.68745871584609
<SOS> `` it is very natural ; this island is a mass of rocks , and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation . '' <EOS>	79.62970100075601
<SOS> `` to whom does this island belong ? '' <EOS>	63.032732093741195
<SOS> `` to tuscany . '' <EOS>	71.81345573321211
<SOS> `` what game shall i find there ! '' <EOS>	64.65285923580579
<SOS> `` thousands of wild goats . '' <EOS>	121.21674115200403
<SOS> `` who live upon the stones , i suppose , '' said franz with an incredulous smile . <EOS>	74.56196231845452
<SOS> `` no , but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks . '' <EOS>	64.2291968120393
<SOS> `` where can i sleep ? '' <EOS>	105.46383818201907
<SOS> `` on shore in the grottos , or on board in your cloak ; besides , if your excellency pleases , we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day , and if the wind drops we can use our oars . '' <EOS>	62.92828316056422
<SOS> as franz had sufficient time , and his apartments at rome were not yet available , he accepted the proposition . <EOS>	76.94410573312568
<SOS> upon his answer in the affirmative , the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone . <EOS>	97.87753264427991
<SOS> `` well , '' asked he , `` what now ? <EOS>	62.774144559648434
<SOS> is there any difficulty in the way ? '' <EOS>	96.51914180562268
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	100.83673342643867
<SOS> replied the captain , `` but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port . '' <EOS>	49.24607315638103
<SOS> `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	61.169466666671845
<SOS> `` monte cristo although uninhabited , yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica , sardinia , and africa , and if it becomes known that we have been there , we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn . '' <EOS>	108.12454302418637
<SOS> `` the deuce ! <EOS>	75.54398382539249
<SOS> that puts a different face on the matter . <EOS>	91.49564326093946
<SOS> six days ! <EOS>	52.72299973636935
<SOS> why , that 's as long as the almighty took to make the world ! <EOS>	84.51931681039201
<SOS> too long a wait too long . '' <EOS>	63.887963908513605
<SOS> `` but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	98.68425257700206
<SOS> `` oh , i shall not , '' cried franz . <EOS>	95.89278093342087
<SOS> `` nor i , nor i , '' chorused the sailors . <EOS>	85.63150198144788
<SOS> `` then steer for monte cristo . '' <EOS>	81.76050104091338
<SOS> the captain gave his orders , the helm was put up , and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island . <EOS>	88.38770430031711
<SOS> franz waited until all was in order , and when the sail was filled , and the four sailors had taken their places three forward , and one at the helm he resumed the conversation . <EOS>	58.773321593940175
<SOS> `` gaetano , '' said he to the captain , `` you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates , who are , it seems to me , a very different kind of game from the goats . '' <EOS>	72.86200458905496
<SOS> `` yes , your excellency , and it is true . '' <EOS>	94.26667563925484
<SOS> `` i knew there were smugglers , but i thought that since the capture of algiers , and the destruction of the regency , pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat . '' <EOS>	94.75085556895674
<SOS> `` your excellency is mistaken ; there are pirates , like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii. , and who yet , every day , rob travellers at the gates of rome . <EOS>	66.22056407490871
<SOS> has not your excellency heard that the french chargé d'affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri ? '' <EOS>	44.660511262113204
<SOS> `` oh , yes , i heard that . '' <EOS>	51.8984027160172
<SOS> `` well , then , if , like us , your excellency lived at leghorn , you would hear , from time to time , that a little merchant vessel , or an english yacht that was expected at bastia , at porto ferrajo , or at civita vecchia , has not arrived ; no one knows what has become of it , but , doubtless , it has struck on a rock and foundered . <EOS>	70.21816543891315
<SOS> now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat , manned by six or eight men , who have surprised and plundered it , some dark and stormy night , near some desert and gloomy island , as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest . '' <EOS>	87.56654115516581
<SOS> `` but , '' asked franz , who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat , `` why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french , sardinian , or tuscan governments ? '' <EOS>	85.89841155424203
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	93.66777070097152
<SOS> said gaetano with a smile . <EOS>	111.80561850847938
<SOS> `` yes , why ? '' <EOS>	62.19519695588389
<SOS> `` because , in the first place , they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking , then they bind the crew hand and foot , they attach to everyone 's neck a four and twenty pound ball , a large hole is chopped in the vessel 's bottom , and then they leave her . <EOS>	92.10283280648272
<SOS> at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down . <EOS>	74.3564163445217
<SOS> first one gun ' l goes under , then the other . <EOS>	73.5533660642208
<SOS> then they lift and sink again , and both go under at once . <EOS>	57.77898525361178
<SOS> all at once there 's a noise like a cannon that 's the air blowing up the deck . <EOS>	76.08976793073485
<SOS> soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting , the vessel gives a last groan , spins round and round , and disappears , forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean , and then all is over , so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea . <EOS>	67.42129052475184
<SOS> do you understand now , '' said the captain , `` why no complaints are made to the government , and why the vessel never reaches port ? '' <EOS>	57.1194881589013
<SOS> it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition , franz would have hesitated , but now that they had started , he thought it would be cowardly to draw back . <EOS>	80.76364158534557
<SOS> he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger , but if danger presents itself , combat it with the most unalterable coolness . <EOS>	66.46699513108702
<SOS> calm and resolute , he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel , calculated its probable method of approach ; retreated , if at all , as a point of strategy and not from cowardice ; was quick to see an opening for attack , and won victory at a single thrust . <EOS>	99.10614630525558
<SOS> `` bah ! '' <EOS>	44.17945716776418
<SOS> said he , `` i have travelled through sicily and calabria i have sailed two months in the archipelago , and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate . '' <EOS>	73.02101503164401
<SOS> `` i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project , '' replied gaetano , `` but you questioned me , and i have answered ; that 's all . '' <EOS>	85.86091695086172
<SOS> `` yes , and your conversation is most interesting ; and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible , steer for monte cristo . '' <EOS>	94.09399702502989
<SOS> the wind blew strongly , the boat made six or seven knots an hour , and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage . <EOS>	75.9226460608741
<SOS> as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea , and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another , like cannon balls in an arsenal , with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices . <EOS>	86.28740007480799
<SOS> as for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert , and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing , and on which a few fishing boats , with their white sails , were alone visible . <EOS>	58.41584030012751
<SOS> they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . <EOS>	81.89375489460434
<SOS> little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day ; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain , where it paused an instant , like the fiery crest of a volcano , then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base , and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker ; half an hour after , the night was quite dark . <EOS>	72.25235728850475
<SOS> fortunately , the mariners were used to these latitudes , and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago ; for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared , and monte cristo itself was invisible ; but the sailors seemed , like the lynx , to see in the dark , and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation . <EOS>	51.24025834137529
<SOS> an hour had passed since the sun had set , when franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . <EOS>	81.91519440499049
<SOS> `` what is this light ? '' <EOS>	62.32291475034574
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	71.77765353895008
<SOS> `` hush ! '' <EOS>	56.61823802443505
<SOS> said the captain ; `` it is a fire . '' <EOS>	103.6135957415143
<SOS> `` but you told me the island was uninhabited ? '' <EOS>	59.181741921106166
<SOS> `` i said there were no fixed habitations on it , but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers . '' <EOS>	61.22463983254805
<SOS> `` and for pirates ? '' <EOS>	73.82510202859025
<SOS> `` and for pirates , '' returned gaetano , repeating franz 's words . <EOS>	84.88530304088452
<SOS> `` it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island , for , as you see , the fire is behind us . '' <EOS>	62.60600866149384
<SOS> `` but this fire ? '' <EOS>	88.23240668009674
<SOS> continued franz . <EOS>	75.55769883444272
<SOS> `` it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise ; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire . '' <EOS>	38.51850251657846
<SOS> `` oh , that goes for nothing , '' said gaetano . <EOS>	60.42531605963062
<SOS> `` if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness , you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from pianosa , but only from the sea . '' <EOS>	83.18345812517867
<SOS> `` you think , then , this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors ? '' <EOS>	66.01162046795025
<SOS> `` that is what we must find out , '' returned gaetano , fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star . <EOS>	48.365983088164406
<SOS> `` how can you find out ? '' <EOS>	83.18224324223216
<SOS> `` you shall see . '' <EOS>	69.30083602133239
<SOS> gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes ' discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land . <EOS>	102.37314986676057
<SOS> the pilot again changed the course of the boat , which rapidly approached the island , and was soon within fifty paces of it . <EOS>	83.0045308869244
<SOS> gaetano lowered the sail , and the boat came to rest . <EOS>	54.98794576766504
<SOS> all this was done in silence , and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken . <EOS>	62.396558085176785
<SOS> gaetano , who had proposed the expedition , had taken all the responsibility on himself ; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him , while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away , which , thanks to the darkness , would not be difficult . <EOS>	74.37857764930934
<SOS> as for franz , he examined his arms with the utmost coolness ; he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle ; he loaded them , looked at the priming , and waited quietly . <EOS>	41.267041215464374
<SOS> during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt , and secured his trousers round his waist ; his feet were naked , so he had no shoes and stockings to take off ; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips , and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea , swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound ; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake . <EOS>	66.50760944689574
<SOS> this track soon disappeared ; it was evident that he had touched the shore . <EOS>	49.474869168109706
<SOS> everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour , when the same luminous track was again observed , and the swimmer was soon on board . <EOS>	93.37379491181896
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	89.89582316557737
<SOS> exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison . <EOS>	43.27247973543361
<SOS> `` they are spanish smugglers , '' said he ; `` they have with them two corsican bandits . '' <EOS>	74.71903717421357
<SOS> `` and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers ? '' <EOS>	44.705945327108076
<SOS> `` alas , '' returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity , `` we ought always to help one another . <EOS>	86.37232816236182
<SOS> very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers ; well , they see a vessel , and good fellows like us on board , they come and demand hospitality of us ; you ca n't refuse help to a poor hunted devil ; we receive them , and for greater security we stand out to sea . <EOS>	119.89274937116186
<SOS> this costs us nothing , and saves the life , or at least the liberty , of a fellow creature , who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption . '' <EOS>	77.96252048731448
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	49.18723680256543
<SOS> said franz , `` then you are a smuggler occasionally , gaetano ? '' <EOS>	68.90366872725342
<SOS> `` your excellency , we must live somehow , '' returned the other , smiling impenetrably . <EOS>	54.990640813796986
<SOS> `` then you know the men who are now on monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	51.94585558436571
<SOS> `` oh , yes , we sailors are like freemasons , and recognize each other by signs . '' <EOS>	65.3620444379412
<SOS> `` and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land ? '' <EOS>	46.699635280724515
<SOS> `` nothing at all ; smugglers are not thieves . '' <EOS>	72.71092297954965
<SOS> `` but these two corsican bandits ? '' <EOS>	46.75948439169048
<SOS> said franz , calculating the chances of peril . <EOS>	62.6877105134085
<SOS> `` it is not their fault that they are bandits , but that of the authorities . '' <EOS>	61.01432439039529
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	53.47428258227072
<SOS> `` because they are pursued for having made a stiff , as if it was not in a corsican 's nature to revenge himself . '' <EOS>	100.0420962932686
<SOS> `` what do you mean by having made a stiff ? <EOS>	57.059345460088565
<SOS> having assassinated a man ? '' <EOS>	65.54755191985105
<SOS> said franz , continuing his investigation . <EOS>	79.47015156113208
<SOS> `` i mean that they have killed an enemy , which is a very different thing , '' returned the captain . <EOS>	66.13351341930307
<SOS> `` well , '' said the young man , `` let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits . <EOS>	61.03856005118609
<SOS> do you think they will grant it ? '' <EOS>	69.7047542898187
<SOS> `` without doubt . '' <EOS>	100.21749056305798
<SOS> `` how many are they ? '' <EOS>	59.2402849769671
<SOS> `` four , and the two bandits make six . '' <EOS>	48.961919325834
<SOS> `` just our number , so that if they prove troublesome , we shall be able to hold them in check ; so , for the last time , steer to monte cristo . '' <EOS>	68.63586984876301
<SOS> `` yes , but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions . '' <EOS>	67.53160417635162
<SOS> `` by all means , be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses ; i do more than permit , i exhort you . '' <EOS>	76.98064532459931
<SOS> `` silence , then ! '' <EOS>	63.38464763076574
<SOS> said gaetano . <EOS>	66.85951036895037
<SOS> everyone obeyed . <EOS>	74.99700578971775
<SOS> for a man who , like franz , viewed his position in its true light , it was a grave one . <EOS>	83.07087041114681
<SOS> he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know , and who had no reason to be devoted to him ; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt , and who had often examined his weapons , which were very beautiful , if not with envy , at least with curiosity . <EOS>	63.43590767086461
<SOS> on the other hand , he was about to land , without any other escort than these men , on an island which had , indeed , a very religious name , but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality , thanks to the smugglers and bandits . <EOS>	67.1280184637468
<SOS> the history of the scuttled vessels , which had appeared improbable during the day , seemed very probable at night ; placed as he was between two possible sources of danger , he kept his eye on the crew , and his gun in his hand . <EOS>	71.88100430889561
<SOS> the sailors had again hoisted sail , and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves . <EOS>	67.64083573810589
<SOS> through the darkness franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing , and then , as they rounded a rocky point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated . <EOS>	76.72433278347553
<SOS> the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around . <EOS>	63.85422037733709
<SOS> gaetano skirted the light , carefully keeping the boat in the shadow ; then , when they were opposite the fire , he steered to the centre of the circle , singing a fishing song , of which his companions sung the chorus . <EOS>	49.23736399852135
<SOS> at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions . <EOS>	62.61271034271103
<SOS> they soon appeared satisfied and returned ( with the exception of one , who remained at the shore ) to their fire , at which the carcass of a goat was roasting . <EOS>	69.61150961912439
<SOS> when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore , the man on the beach , who carried a carbine , presented arms after the manner of a sentinel , and cried , `` who comes there ? '' <EOS>	98.71193412016984
<SOS> in sardinian . <EOS>	52.23020354012757
<SOS> franz coolly cocked both barrels . <EOS>	50.237001825689866
<SOS> gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand , but which evidently concerned him . <EOS>	73.66260738790844
<SOS> `` will your excellency give your name , or remain incognito ? '' <EOS>	67.95366363133542
<SOS> asked the captain . <EOS>	55.64246507262139
<SOS> `` my name must rest unknown , '' replied franz ; `` merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure . '' <EOS>	87.76201420443928
<SOS> as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer , the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire , who rose and disappeared among the rocks . <EOS>	71.17436922302716
<SOS> not a word was spoken , everyone seemed occupied , franz with his disembarkment , the sailors with their sails , the smugglers with their goat ; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other . <EOS>	83.3381212898584
<SOS> the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left ; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel , who , turning to the boat , said , `` s'accommodi . '' <EOS>	48.90981869176454
<SOS> the italian s'accommodi is untranslatable ; it means at once , `` come , enter , you are welcome ; make yourself at home ; you are the master . '' <EOS>	52.59728258380179
<SOS> it is like that turkish phrase of molière 's that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance . <EOS>	76.9235732946377
<SOS> the sailors did not wait for a second invitation ; four strokes of the oar brought them to land ; gaetano sprang to shore , exchanged a few words with the sentinel , then his comrades disembarked , and lastly came franz . <EOS>	46.37764018189146
<SOS> one of his guns was swung over his shoulder , gaetano had the other , and a sailor held his rifle ; his dress , half artist , half dandy , did not excite any suspicion , and , consequently , no disquietude . <EOS>	67.79221824189123
<SOS> the boat was moored to the shore , and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac ; but , doubtless , the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel , for he cried out : `` not that way , if you please . '' <EOS>	76.07692562092731
<SOS> gaetano faltered an excuse , and advanced to the opposite side , while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way . <EOS>	73.02124684952175
<SOS> they advanced about thirty paces , and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks , in which seats had been cut , not unlike sentry boxes . <EOS>	59.13802518456082
<SOS> around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles . <EOS>	97.87285278422792
<SOS> franz lowered a torch , and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat , which was , doubtless , one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo . <EOS>	109.18665563496327
<SOS> as for his suspicions , once on terra firma , once that he had seen the indifferent , if not friendly , appearance of his hosts , his anxiety had quite disappeared , or rather , at sight of the goat , had turned to appetite . <EOS>	86.03564338581869
<SOS> he mentioned this to gaetano , who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat , bread , wine , half a dozen partridges , and a good fire to roast them by . <EOS>	80.5579593999146
<SOS> `` besides , '' added he , `` if the smell of their roast meat tempts you , i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice . '' <EOS>	104.54495342871301
<SOS> `` you are a born diplomat , '' returned franz ; `` go and try . '' <EOS>	54.81417903711634
<SOS> meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire . <EOS>	51.73077450373615
<SOS> franz waited impatiently , inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat , when the captain returned with a mysterious air . <EOS>	77.13402601260904
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz , `` anything new ? <EOS>	86.96737197410538
<SOS> do they refuse ? '' <EOS>	80.50626287844537
<SOS> `` on the contrary , '' returned gaetano , `` the chief , who was told you were a young frenchman , invites you to sup with him . '' <EOS>	111.17401900410418
<SOS> `` well , '' observed franz , `` this chief is very polite , and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper . '' <EOS>	53.085486193420174
<SOS> `` oh , it is not that ; he has plenty , and to spare , for supper ; but he makes one condition , and rather a peculiar one , before he will receive you at his house . '' <EOS>	64.44434696584075
<SOS> `` his house ? <EOS>	69.57887826276126
<SOS> has he built one here , then ? '' <EOS>	60.25387095457064
<SOS> `` no , but he has a very comfortable one all the same , so they say . '' <EOS>	62.32560422633899
<SOS> `` you know this chief , then ? '' <EOS>	85.1191055606101
<SOS> `` i have heard talk of him . '' <EOS>	64.3888749324551
<SOS> `` favorably or otherwise ? '' <EOS>	84.47325813172738
<SOS> `` both . '' <EOS>	72.62110395961135
<SOS> `` the deuce ! <EOS>	51.35272114972182
<SOS> and what is this condition ? '' <EOS>	89.05017139968452
<SOS> `` that you are blindfolded , and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you . '' <EOS>	59.81697970586139
<SOS> franz looked at gaetano , to see , if possible , what he thought of this proposal . <EOS>	64.73326194786327
<SOS> `` ah , '' replied he , guessing franz 's thought , `` i know this is a serious matter . '' <EOS>	39.92135828730181
<SOS> `` what should you do in my place ? '' <EOS>	42.256642385853056
<SOS> `` i , who have nothing to lose , i should go . '' <EOS>	101.74976507806416
<SOS> < num > m `` you would accept ? '' <EOS>	61.895862297834064
<SOS> `` yes , were it only out of curiosity . '' <EOS>	89.76408831935272
<SOS> `` there is something very peculiar about this chief , then ? '' <EOS>	117.54008652501878
<SOS> `` listen , '' said gaetano , lowering his voice , `` i do not know if what they say is true '' he stopped to see if anyone was near . <EOS>	108.9831592790687
<SOS> `` what do they say ? '' <EOS>	75.69474891409199
<SOS> `` that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing . '' <EOS>	71.31751306117715
<SOS> `` what nonsense ! '' <EOS>	59.875507978207004
<SOS> said franz , reseating himself . <EOS>	69.48334986820251
<SOS> `` it is no nonsense ; it is quite true . <EOS>	87.80338192427146
<SOS> cama , the pilot of the saint ferdinand , went in once , and he came back amazed , vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales . '' <EOS>	97.3342688351444
<SOS> `` do you know , '' observed franz , `` that with such stories you make me think of ali baba 's enchanted cavern ? '' <EOS>	60.64520635434272
<SOS> `` i tell you what i have been told . '' <EOS>	68.2701918008604
<SOS> `` then you advise me to accept ? '' <EOS>	66.57964862728899
<SOS> `` oh , i do n't say that ; your excellency will do as you please ; i should be sorry to advise you in the matter . '' <EOS>	94.51009953705464
<SOS> franz pondered the matter for a few moments , concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had , and seeing only the prospect of a good supper , accepted . <EOS>	75.47710932229514
<SOS> gaetano departed with the reply . <EOS>	65.8926524299188
<SOS> franz was prudent , and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host . <EOS>	65.13124875628627
<SOS> he turned towards the sailor , who , during this dialogue , had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office , and asked him how these men had landed , as no vessel of any kind was visible . <EOS>	112.88336308290167
<SOS> `` never mind that , '' returned the sailor , `` i know their vessel . '' <EOS>	67.70981589224753
<SOS> `` is it a very beautiful vessel ? '' <EOS>	48.29680425720648
<SOS> `` i would not wish for a better to sail round the world . '' <EOS>	87.70265549813023
<SOS> `` of what burden is she ? '' <EOS>	92.60215278804147
<SOS> `` about a hundred tons ; but she is built to stand any weather . <EOS>	48.43253500921937
<SOS> she is what the english call a yacht . '' <EOS>	75.97714556251854
<SOS> `` where was she built ? '' <EOS>	66.63319118919645
<SOS> `` i know not ; but my own opinion is she is a genoese . '' <EOS>	83.66995650052726
<SOS> `` and how did a leader of smugglers , '' continued franz , `` venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa ? '' <EOS>	87.80248971734838
<SOS> `` i did not say that the owner was a smuggler , '' replied the sailor . <EOS>	76.40424053482623
<SOS> `` no ; but gaetano did , i thought . '' <EOS>	79.19511757219738
<SOS> `` gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance , he had not then spoken to anyone . '' <EOS>	77.38841413886115
<SOS> `` and if this person be not a smuggler , who is he ? '' <EOS>	93.32213853080006
<SOS> `` a wealthy signor , who travels for his pleasure . '' <EOS>	45.30439295411928
<SOS> `` come , '' thought franz , `` he is still more mysterious , since the two accounts do not agree . '' <EOS>	55.21976759906512
<SOS> `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	110.69875781117855
<SOS> `` if you ask him , he says sinbad the sailor ; but i doubt if it be his real name . '' <EOS>	67.87391412934498
<SOS> `` sinbad the sailor ? '' <EOS>	62.47994448599959
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	46.31942251480199
<SOS> `` and where does he reside ? '' <EOS>	58.3554749260614
<SOS> `` on the sea . '' <EOS>	62.77716945210841
<SOS> `` what country does he come from ? '' <EOS>	85.82212558077204
<SOS> `` i do not know . '' <EOS>	57.90046547684106
<SOS> `` have you ever seen him ? '' <EOS>	86.87169807363007
<SOS> `` sometimes . '' <EOS>	104.57105662610618
<SOS> `` what sort of a man is he ? '' <EOS>	67.74082742665394
<SOS> `` your excellency will judge for yourself . '' <EOS>	62.95683088380863
<SOS> `` where will he receive me ? '' <EOS>	80.48036400138852
<SOS> `` no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of . '' <EOS>	68.03014306115628
<SOS> `` have you never had the curiosity , when you have landed and found this island deserted , to seek for this enchanted palace ? '' <EOS>	60.938683616835455
<SOS> `` oh , yes , more than once , but always in vain ; we examined the grotto all over , but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening ; they say that the door is not opened by a key , but a magic word . '' <EOS>	47.80816662281212
<SOS> `` decidedly , '' muttered franz , `` this is an arabian nights ' adventure . '' <EOS>	68.72344543817869
<SOS> `` his excellency waits for you , '' said a voice , which he recognized as that of the sentinel . <EOS>	113.88586014060263
<SOS> he was accompanied by two of the yacht 's crew . <EOS>	70.00944532774183
<SOS> franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket , and presented it to the man who had spoken to him . <EOS>	73.98468300419543
<SOS> without uttering a word , they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion . <EOS>	79.07032018419348
<SOS> afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage . <EOS>	53.27099667002018
<SOS> he promised . <EOS>	87.52762533304764
<SOS> then his two guides took his arms , and he went on , guided by them , and preceded by the sentinel . <EOS>	58.23408483954874
<SOS> after going about thirty paces , he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting , and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac ; they then led him on about fifty paces farther , evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to go a refusal he could now comprehend . <EOS>	46.36608998405357
<SOS> presently , by a change in the atmosphere , he knew that they were entering a cave ; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling , and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed , and became balmy and perfumed . <EOS>	63.05962501953709
<SOS> at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet , and his guides let go their hold of him . <EOS>	86.26234786253357
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence , and then a voice , in excellent french , although , with a foreign accent , said : `` welcome , sir . <EOS>	66.44625869016987
<SOS> i beg you will remove your bandage . '' <EOS>	115.47506338147605
<SOS> it may be supposed , then , franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission , but took off the handkerchief , and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age , dressed in a tunisian costume , that is to say , a red cap with a long blue silk tassel , a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold , pantaloons of deep red , large and full gaiters of the same color , embroidered with gold like the vest , and yellow slippers ; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist , and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle . <EOS>	81.98097685930144
<SOS> although of a paleness that was almost livid , this man had a remarkably handsome face ; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling ; his nose , quite straight , and projecting direct from the brow , was of the pure greek type , while his teeth , as white as pearls , were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them . <EOS>	80.17415299277411
<SOS> his pallor was so peculiar , that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed , and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life . <EOS>	80.90201338996148
<SOS> he was not particularly tall , but extremely well made , and , like the men of the south , had small hands and feet . <EOS>	63.7171894988748
<SOS> but what astonished franz , who had treated gaetano 's description as a fable , was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself . <EOS>	64.45019675290436
<SOS> the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade , worked with flowers of gold . <EOS>	67.70275215076461
<SOS> in a recess was a kind of divan , surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards , and the handles resplendent with gems ; from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass , of beautiful shape and color , while the feet rested on a turkey carpet , in which they sunk to the instep ; tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered , and also in front of another door , leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated . <EOS>	49.71734519328026
<SOS> the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise , and , moreover , returned look for look , not even taking his eyes off him . <EOS>	81.62929805259971
<SOS> `` sir , '' he said , after a pause , `` a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither ; but as , during the greater portion of the year , this island is deserted , if the secret of this abode were discovered , i should doubtless , find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder , which would be exceedingly annoying , not for the loss it occasioned me , but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure . <EOS>	105.02280874121257
<SOS> let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness , and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say , a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds . '' <EOS>	118.67021234348513
<SOS> `` ma foi , my dear sir , '' replied franz , `` make no apologies . <EOS>	48.91361255255114
<SOS> i have always observed that they bandage people 's eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces , for instance , those of raoul in the huguenots , and really i have nothing to complain of , for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights . '' <EOS>	86.21397572770222
<SOS> < num > m `` alas ! <EOS>	60.2640462390049
<SOS> i may say with lucullus , if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit , i would have prepared for it . <EOS>	89.59812398990574
<SOS> but such as is my hermitage , it is at your disposal ; such as is my supper , it is yours to share , if you will . <EOS>	82.61362971864226
<SOS> ali , is the supper ready ? '' <EOS>	92.40106606289764
<SOS> at this moment the tapestry moved aside , and a nubian , black as ebony , and dressed in a plain white tunic , made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room . <EOS>	71.77156335042774
<SOS> `` now , '' said the unknown to franz , `` i do not know if you are of my opinion , but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another . <EOS>	117.23859977871282
<SOS> pray observe , that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title . <EOS>	72.84720087234724
<SOS> i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you . <EOS>	82.73956928714864
<SOS> as for myself , that i may put you at your ease , i tell you that i am generally called 'sinbad the sailor . ' '' <EOS>	104.84877376391356
<SOS> `` and i , '' replied franz , `` will tell you , as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin , that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin . <EOS>	68.38475803700157
<SOS> that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius . '' <EOS>	96.959523144941
<SOS> `` well , then , signor aladdin , '' replied the singular amphitryon , `` you heard our repast announced , will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room , your humble servant going first to show the way ? '' <EOS>	60.98332725651618
<SOS> at these words , moving aside the tapestry , sinbad preceded his guest . <EOS>	84.26108655576908
<SOS> franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment ; the table was splendidly covered , and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him . <EOS>	75.08302319874063
<SOS> the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left ; it was entirely of marble , with antique bas reliefs of priceless value ; and at the four corners of this apartment , which was oblong , were four magnificent statues , having baskets in their hands . <EOS>	69.23324832068003
<SOS> these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit ; there were sicily pine apples , pomegranates from malaga , oranges from the balearic isles , peaches from france , and dates from tunis . <EOS>	102.03926214227349
<SOS> the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds ; a boar 's ham with jelly , a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce , a glorious turbot , and a gigantic lobster . <EOS>	85.23058032153601
<SOS> between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties . <EOS>	57.789371249629845
<SOS> the dishes were of silver , and the plates of japanese china . <EOS>	56.68682883337309
<SOS> franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream . <EOS>	74.8966711170661
<SOS> ali alone was present to wait at table , and acquitted himself so admirably , that the guest complimented his host thereupon . <EOS>	49.78086707244612
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied he , while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace `` yes , he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me , and does all he can to prove it . <EOS>	109.32889368412542
<SOS> he remembers that i saved his life , and as he has a regard for his head , he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders . '' <EOS>	52.743822127228874
<SOS> ali approached his master , took his hand , and kissed it . <EOS>	59.9980645495278
<SOS> `` would it be impertinent , signor sinbad , '' said franz , `` to ask you the particulars of this kindness ? '' <EOS>	64.93820626911698
<SOS> < num > m `` oh , they are simple enough , '' replied the host . <EOS>	96.81813332868467
<SOS> `` it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color , and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out , and his hand and head cut off ; the tongue the first day , the hand the second , and the head the third . <EOS>	67.19494891606021
<SOS> i always had a desire to have a mute in my service , so learning the day his tongue was cut out , i went to the bey , and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double barreled gun , which i knew he was very desirous of having . <EOS>	80.05252550348774
<SOS> he hesitated a moment , he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil 's punishment . <EOS>	66.73610202333961
<SOS> but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highness 's yataghan to pieces , the bey yielded , and agreed to forgive the hand and head , but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis . <EOS>	51.485205855556906
<SOS> this was a useless clause in the bargain , for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa , he runs down below , and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe . '' <EOS>	83.05028594939358
<SOS> franz remained a moment silent and pensive , hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness , half cruelty , with which his host related the brief narrative . <EOS>	80.06212093981254
<SOS> `` and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed , '' he said , by way of changing the conversation , `` you pass your life in travelling ? '' <EOS>	89.78653575877298
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	58.60691303004061
<SOS> i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it , '' said the unknown with a singular smile ; `` and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season . '' <EOS>	60.238669837910244
<SOS> although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness , his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity . <EOS>	84.50249481529993
<SOS> `` you have suffered a great deal , sir ? '' <EOS>	113.61108432517483
<SOS> said franz inquiringly . <EOS>	83.46693814561601
<SOS> sinbad started and looked fixedly at him , as he replied , `` what makes you suppose so ? '' <EOS>	78.5232461245059
<SOS> `` everything , '' answered franz , `` your voice , your look , your pallid complexion , and even the life you lead . '' <EOS>	98.27032080220718
<SOS> `` i ? <EOS>	56.12261895553552
<SOS> i live the happiest life possible , the real life of a pasha . <EOS>	56.09893359116057
<SOS> i am king of all creation . <EOS>	43.771673043629164
<SOS> i am pleased with one place , and stay there ; i get tired of it , and leave it ; i am free as a bird and have wings like one ; my attendants obey my slightest wish . <EOS>	101.22961894044202
<SOS> sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law . <EOS>	63.826527979370404
<SOS> then i have my mode of dispensing justice , silent and sure , without respite or appeal , which condemns or pardons , and which no one sees . <EOS>	90.44598469287314
<SOS> ah , if you had tasted my life , you would not desire any other , and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there . '' <EOS>	61.753537359321975
<SOS> `` revenge , for instance ! '' <EOS>	84.96281238259108
<SOS> observed franz . <EOS>	48.89632008432974
<SOS> the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts . <EOS>	109.12147287730232
<SOS> `` and why revenge ? '' <EOS>	56.6874720984106
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	46.26997957665897
<SOS> `` because , '' replied franz , `` you seem to me like a man who , persecuted by society , has a fearful account to settle with it . '' <EOS>	85.77203315874341
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	54.7267898504339
<SOS> responded sinbad , laughing with his singular laugh , which displayed his white and sharp teeth . <EOS>	71.78870103681909
<SOS> `` you have not guessed rightly . <EOS>	53.05614775085226
<SOS> such as you see me i am , a sort of philosopher , and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert , and the man in the little blue cloak . '' <EOS>	93.48882824815342
<SOS> `` and will that be the first time you ever took that journey ? '' <EOS>	68.75063013916665
<SOS> `` yes ; it will . <EOS>	113.66096323988805
<SOS> i must seem to you by no means curious , but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other . '' <EOS>	54.40495709970269
<SOS> < num > m `` and do you propose to make this journey very shortly ? '' <EOS>	65.92660151170196
<SOS> `` i do not know ; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements . '' <EOS>	53.10035894395725
<SOS> `` i should like to be there at the time you come , and i will endeavor to repay you , as far as lies in my power , for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo . '' <EOS>	57.193671370963415
<SOS> `` i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure , '' replied the host , `` but , unfortunately , if i go there , it will be , in all probability , incognito . '' <EOS>	57.799994148098094
<SOS> the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz , for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice . <EOS>	59.787838021953796
<SOS> then ali brought on the dessert , or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table . <EOS>	66.84034313578753
<SOS> between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover . <EOS>	108.7201013833155
<SOS> the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz 's curiosity . <EOS>	67.46175313448857
<SOS> he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste , something like preserved angelica , but which was perfectly unknown to him . <EOS>	60.33979769670382
<SOS> he replaced the lid , as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it , and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment . <EOS>	70.44388720617165
<SOS> `` you can not guess , '' said he , `` what there is in that small vase , can you ? '' <EOS>	92.69403970339151
<SOS> `` no , i really can not . '' <EOS>	98.99678876204779
<SOS> `` well , then , that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter . '' <EOS>	53.4723974443697
<SOS> `` but , '' replied franz , `` this ambrosia , no doubt , in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name ; in vulgar phrase , what may you term this composition , for which , to tell the truth , i do not feel any particular desire ? '' <EOS>	95.82620333775252
<SOS> `` ah , thus it is that our material origin is revealed , '' cried sinbad ; `` we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing , without regarding it , or if we do see and regard it , yet without recognizing it . <EOS>	104.7837239753338
<SOS> are you a man for the substantials , and is gold your god ? <EOS>	77.04686749088306
<SOS> taste this , and the mines of peru , guzerat , and golconda are opened to you . <EOS>	45.30233167437001
<SOS> are you a man of imagination a poet ? <EOS>	82.19665678527456
<SOS> taste this , and the boundaries of possibility disappear ; the fields of infinite space open to you , you advance free in heart , free in mind , into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie . <EOS>	90.61138845342737
<SOS> are you ambitious , and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth ? <EOS>	81.38889536718027
<SOS> taste this , and in an hour you will be a king , not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france , spain , or england , but king of the world , king of the universe , king of creation ; without bowing at the feet of satan , you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth . <EOS>	77.91039099586175
<SOS> is it not tempting what i offer you , and is it not an easy thing , since it is only to do thus ? <EOS>	69.72387240848269
<SOS> look ! '' <EOS>	55.783124344695565
<SOS> at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded , took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat , raised it to his lips , and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards . <EOS>	77.93784608464841
<SOS> franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat , but when he had finished , he inquired : `` what , then , is this precious stuff ? '' <EOS>	83.14500262355904
<SOS> `` did you ever hear , '' he replied , `` of the old man of the mountain , who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste ? '' <EOS>	82.13581774726259
<SOS> `` of course i have . '' <EOS>	61.37143254605508
<SOS> `` well , you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name . <EOS>	46.62548591822035
<SOS> in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen ben sabah , and in these gardens isolated pavilions . <EOS>	86.1972190615809
<SOS> into these pavilions he admitted the elect , and there , says marco polo , gave them to eat a certain herb , which transported them to paradise , in the midst of ever blooming shrubs , ever ripe fruit , and ever lovely virgins . <EOS>	101.94088718887345
<SOS> what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream ; but it was a dream so soft , so voluptuous , so enthralling , that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them , and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity , struck down the designated victim , died in torture without a murmur , believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb , now before you , had given them a slight foretaste . '' <EOS>	86.01675380599548
<SOS> `` then , '' cried franz , `` it is hashish ! <EOS>	76.57059574834844
<SOS> i know that by name at least . '' <EOS>	109.12034213057771
<SOS> `` that is it precisely , signor aladdin ; it is hashish the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria , the hashish of abou gor , the celebrated maker , the only man , the man to whom there should be built a palace , inscribed with these words , a grateful world to the dealer in happiness . '' <EOS>	93.94166804084989
<SOS> `` do you know , '' said franz , `` i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies . '' <EOS>	59.761797653042784
<SOS> `` judge for yourself , signor aladdin judge , but do not confine yourself to one trial . <EOS>	66.3153659342466
<SOS> like everything else , we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression , gentle or violent , sad or joyous . <EOS>	47.30561679840679
<SOS> there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance , in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain . <EOS>	72.80523483392554
<SOS> nature subdued must yield in the combat , the dream must succeed to reality , and then the dream reigns supreme , then the dream becomes life , and life becomes the dream . <EOS>	67.70075658085722
<SOS> but what changes occur ! <EOS>	112.18478803305425
<SOS> it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence , that you would desire to live no longer , but to dream thus forever . <EOS>	85.18231463927526
<SOS> when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world , you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell ! <EOS>	77.57423627436438
<SOS> taste the hashish , guest of mine taste the hashish . '' <EOS>	108.99411299508002
<SOS> franz 's only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation , about as much in quantity as his host had eaten , and lift it to his mouth. `` <EOS>	72.65676988466404
<SOS> diable ! `` <EOS>	100.44301781321273
<SOS> he said , after having swallowed the divine preserve . <EOS>	66.07632417151561
<SOS> `` i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe , but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say . '' <EOS>	63.09109895284066
<SOS> `` because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors . <EOS>	61.994988190751776
<SOS> tell me , the first time you tasted oysters , tea , porter , truffles , and sundry other dainties which you now adore , did you like them ? <EOS>	85.17976717828276
<SOS> could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida , and the chinese eat swallows ' nests ? <EOS>	79.89748093992128
<SOS> eh ? <EOS>	54.852945148636586
<SOS> no ! <EOS>	84.07324821546229
<SOS> well , it is the same with hashish ; only eat for a week , and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor , which now appears to you flat and distasteful . <EOS>	86.2269653656464
<SOS> let us now go into the adjoining chamber , which is your apartment , and ali will bring us coffee and pipes . '' <EOS>	62.785033237520935
<SOS> they both arose , and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so , that we might , like his guest , have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant , franz entered still another apartment . <EOS>	68.30960929988966
<SOS> it was simply yet richly furnished . <EOS>	78.83784215495264
<SOS> it was round , and a large divan completely encircled it . <EOS>	52.13875254446902
<SOS> divan , walls , ceiling , floor , were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets ; there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas , striped tiger skins from bengal ; panther skins from the cape , spotted beautifully , like those that appeared to dante ; bear skins from siberia , fox skins from norway , and so on ; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other , so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf , or reclining on the most luxurious bed . <EOS>	72.02647687531609
<SOS> both laid themselves down on the divan ; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach , and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice . <EOS>	55.612775531204136
<SOS> each of them took one , which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee . <EOS>	85.76681314993024
<SOS> there was a moment 's silence , during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly , even in the midst of his conversation ; and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie , into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco , which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind , and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul . <EOS>	75.97603903817803
<SOS> ali brought in the coffee . <EOS>	98.8570343363092
<SOS> `` how do you take it ? '' <EOS>	88.72637327201045
<SOS> inquired the unknown ; `` in the french or turkish style , strong or weak , sugar or none , cool or boiling ? <EOS>	82.86632149742604
<SOS> as you please ; it is ready in all ways . '' <EOS>	54.818540549945176
<SOS> `` i will take it in the turkish style , '' replied franz . <EOS>	51.57017074073736
<SOS> `` and you are right , '' said his host ; `` it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life . <EOS>	46.69484759064141
<SOS> ah , those orientals ; they are the only men who know how to live . <EOS>	67.15061311019201
<SOS> as for me , '' he added , with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man , `` when i have completed my affairs in paris , i shall go and die in the east ; and should you wish to see me again , you must seek me at cairo , bagdad , or ispahan . '' <EOS>	51.653345496795325
<SOS> < num > m `` ma foi , '' said franz , `` it would be the easiest thing in the world ; for i feel eagle 's wings springing out at my shoulders , and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours . '' <EOS>	46.27795402417824
<SOS> `` ah , yes , the hashish is beginning its work . <EOS>	69.3291816339041
<SOS> well , unfurl your wings , and fly into superhuman regions ; fear nothing , there is a watch over you ; and if your wings , like those of icarus , melt before the sun , we are here to ease your fall . '' <EOS>	69.02083614310953
<SOS> he then said something in arabic to ali , who made a sign of obedience and withdrew , but not to any distance . <EOS>	75.67867680973909
<SOS> as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him . <EOS>	79.17353134947692
<SOS> all the bodily fatigue of the day , all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on , disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep , when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber . <EOS>	56.92536224856762
<SOS> his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness , his perception brightened in a remarkable manner , his senses seemed to redouble their power , the horizon continued to expand ; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms , and which he had seen before he slept , but a blue , transparent , unbounded horizon , with all the blue of the ocean , all the spangles of the sun , all the perfumes of the summer breeze ; then , in the midst of the songs of his sailors , songs so clear and sonorous , that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down , he saw the island of monte cristo , no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves , but as an oasis in the desert ; then , as his boat drew nearer , the songs became louder , for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven , as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither , or amphion , the enchanter , intended there to build a city . <EOS>	69.71453992860923
<SOS> at length the boat touched the shore , but without effort , without shock , as lips touch lips ; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody . <EOS>	72.64439524524605
<SOS> he descended , or rather seemed to descend , several steps , inhaling the fresh and balmy air , like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe , formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming , and such fires as burn the very senses ; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep , from sinbad , his singular host , to ali , the mute attendant ; then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes , like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished , and he was again in the chamber of statues , lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure . <EOS>	84.61300650778728
<SOS> they were the same statues , rich in form , in attraction , and poesy , with eyes of fascination , smiles of love , and bright and flowing hair . <EOS>	102.21275082679674
<SOS> they were phryne , cleopatra , messalina , those three celebrated courtesans . <EOS>	59.69113821175077
<SOS> then among them glided like a pure ray , like a christian angel in the midst of olympus , one of those chaste figures , those calm shadows , those soft visions , which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons . <EOS>	82.08118451911704
<SOS> then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love , and approached the couch on which he was reposing , their feet hidden in their long white tunics , their throats bare , hair flowing like waves , and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist , but which saints withstood , and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird ; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss . <EOS>	68.56176287702584
<SOS> it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes , and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled ; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect . <EOS>	40.37608736238917
<SOS> lips of stone turned to flame , breasts of ice became like heated lava , so that to franz , yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug , love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture , as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips , and he was held in cool serpent like embraces . <EOS>	50.31123694007329
<SOS> the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall , and at length , weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul , he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses , and the enchantment of his marvellous dream . <EOS>	73.66415907793987
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	78.67580271854895
<SOS> the waking when franz returned to himself , he seemed still to be in a dream . <EOS>	75.12783503395165
<SOS> he thought himself in a sepulchre , into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated . <EOS>	75.56693406833567
<SOS> he stretched forth his hand , and touched stone ; he rose to his seat , and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather , very soft and odoriferous . <EOS>	83.80031311264747
<SOS> the vision had fled ; and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb , they had vanished at his waking . <EOS>	62.38573361508935
<SOS> he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came , and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality . <EOS>	53.5071448455293
<SOS> he found that he was in a grotto , went towards the opening , and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky . <EOS>	80.94240323554708
<SOS> the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun ; on the shore the sailors were sitting , chatting and laughing ; and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor , undulating gracefully on the water . <EOS>	83.61258298649014
<SOS> there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow , and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach , that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver . <EOS>	98.13481942535935
<SOS> he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature , specially after a fantastic dream ; then gradually this view of the outer world , so calm , so pure , so grand , reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision , and once more awakened memory . <EOS>	76.75379315151747
<SOS> he recalled his arrival on the island , his presentation to a smuggler chief , a subterranean palace full of splendor , an excellent supper , and a spoonful of hashish . <EOS>	93.80862918253544
<SOS> it seemed , however , even in the very face of open day , that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed , so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream , and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination . <EOS>	79.81047743533232
<SOS> thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors , seated on a rock , or undulating in the vessel , one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses . <EOS>	82.45250487799316
<SOS> otherwise , his head was perfectly clear , and his body refreshed ; he was free from the slightest headache ; on the contrary , he felt a certain degree of lightness , a faculty for absorbing the pure air , and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever . <EOS>	67.02204071802048
<SOS> he went gayly up to the sailors , who rose as soon as they perceived him ; and the patron , accosting him , said : `` the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency , and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person ; but he trusts you will excuse him , as very important business calls him to malaga . '' <EOS>	67.54264016471794
<SOS> `` so , then , gaetano , '' said franz , `` this is , then , all reality ; there exists a man who has received me in this island , entertained me right royally , and has departed while i was asleep ? '' <EOS>	71.73463933253083
<SOS> `` he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread ; and if you will use your glass , you will , in all probability , recognize your host in the midst of his crew . '' <EOS>	100.79512272299681
<SOS> so saying , gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica . <EOS>	49.26881696831045
<SOS> franz adjusted his telescope , and directed it towards the yacht . <EOS>	69.47082160874402
<SOS> gaetano was not mistaken . <EOS>	52.67047598710521
<SOS> at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore , and holding a spy glass in his hand . <EOS>	61.67197953007976
<SOS> he was attired as he had been on the previous evening , and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu . <EOS>	112.4857878270168
<SOS> franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals . <EOS>	85.99790790948202
<SOS> after a second , a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel , which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air , and then franz heard a slight report . <EOS>	72.89200538272742
<SOS> `` there , do you hear ? '' <EOS>	42.165027186341334
<SOS> observed gaetano ; `` he is bidding you adieu . '' <EOS>	83.50000585760031
<SOS> the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air , but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore . <EOS>	53.12080035254818
<SOS> `` what are your excellency 's orders ? '' <EOS>	55.402013236800606
<SOS> inquired gaetano . <EOS>	68.38268405969892
<SOS> `` in the first place , light me a torch . '' <EOS>	61.208753348448774
<SOS> `` ah , yes , i understand , '' replied the patron , `` to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment . <EOS>	108.34522996435457
<SOS> with much pleasure , your excellency , if it would amuse you ; and i will get you the torch you ask for . <EOS>	45.08357853372677
<SOS> but i too have had the idea you have , and two or three times the same fancy has come over me ; but i have always given it up . <EOS>	69.28284560301684
<SOS> giovanni , light a torch , '' he added , `` and give it to his excellency . '' <EOS>	83.55159657406891
<SOS> giovanni obeyed . <EOS>	101.48937115748079
<SOS> franz took the lamp , and entered the subterranean grotto , followed by gaetano . <EOS>	53.10261229391476
<SOS> he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there ; but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto . <EOS>	56.486585271768796
<SOS> he saw nothing , unless that , by traces of smoke , others had before him attempted the same thing , and , like him , in vain . <EOS>	77.34318281642474
<SOS> yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall , as impenetrable as futurity , without strict scrutiny ; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it , or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way . <EOS>	59.41692135301177
<SOS> all was vain ; and he lost two hours in his attempts , which were at last utterly useless . <EOS>	115.11873556981004
<SOS> at the end of this time he gave up his search , and gaetano smiled . <EOS>	104.55080925104282
<SOS> when franz appeared again on the shore , the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon . <EOS>	66.10750816443196
<SOS> he looked again through his glass , but even then he could not distinguish anything . <EOS>	56.318060263575106
<SOS> gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats , which he had utterly forgotten . <EOS>	97.62410931961956
<SOS> he took his fowling piece , and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty , rather than enjoying a pleasure ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids . <EOS>	90.34502783226765
<SOS> these animals , though wild and agile as chamois , were too much like domestic goats , and franz could not consider them as game . <EOS>	52.188705650204064
<SOS> moreover , other ideas , much more enthralling , occupied his mind . <EOS>	53.400275933281655
<SOS> since , the evening before , he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights , and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto . <EOS>	90.05462449137384
<SOS> then , in spite of the failure of his first search , he began a second , after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids . <EOS>	93.54753719652906
<SOS> the second visit was a long one , and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready . <EOS>	97.33551708346236
<SOS> franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper ; and he saw the little yacht , now like a sea gull on the wave , continuing her flight towards corsica . <EOS>	78.21273819831511
<SOS> `` why , '' he remarked to gaetano , `` you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga , while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio . '' <EOS>	90.95506553944125
<SOS> `` do n't you remember , '' said the patron , `` i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands ? '' <EOS>	61.94833591392148
<SOS> `` true ; and he is going to land them , '' added franz . <EOS>	109.06486759383921
<SOS> `` precisely so , '' replied gaetano . <EOS>	123.26861949305065
<SOS> `` ah , he is one who fears neither god nor satan , they say , and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service . '' <EOS>	58.257185819846036
<SOS> < num > m `` but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy , '' said franz . <EOS>	87.63167699354338
<SOS> `` and what cares he for that , '' replied gaetano with a laugh , `` or any authorities ? <EOS>	51.16728170919286
<SOS> he smiles at them . <EOS>	52.989144027704164
<SOS> let them try to pursue him ! <EOS>	63.37606486600407
<SOS> why , in the first place , his yacht is not a ship , but a bird , and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine ; and if he were to throw himself on the coast , why , is he not certain of finding friends everywhere ? '' <EOS>	92.85126338182367
<SOS> it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad , franz 's host , had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean , and so enjoyed exceptional privileges . <EOS>	56.16145047883409
<SOS> as to franz , he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo . <EOS>	111.66297745639488
<SOS> he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto ; he consequently despatched his breakfast , and , his boat being ready , he hastened on board , and they were soon under way . <EOS>	116.43470507153502
<SOS> at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht , as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio . <EOS>	74.87647195685977
<SOS> with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night ; and then supper , sinbad , hashish , statues , all became a dream for franz . <EOS>	57.157607149085536
<SOS> the boat sailed on all day and all night , and next morning , when the sun rose , they had lost sight of monte cristo . <EOS>	51.18406509295592
<SOS> when franz had once again set foot on shore , he forgot , for the moment at least , the events which had just passed , while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence , and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion , who was awaiting him at rome . <EOS>	81.29965961675255
<SOS> he set out , and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach . <EOS>	114.39920925507268
<SOS> an apartment , as we have said , had been retained beforehand , and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini 's hotel . <EOS>	79.2809131736745
<SOS> but this was not so easy a matter , for the streets were thronged with people , and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events ; and at rome there are four great events in every year , the carnival , holy week , corpus christi , and the feast of st. peter . <EOS>	59.916817886852535
<SOS> all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy , between life and death , which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot , a resting place full of poetry and character , and at which franz had already halted five or six times , and at each time found it more marvellous and striking . <EOS>	69.59001110999017
<SOS> at last he made his way through the mob , which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent , and reached the hotel . <EOS>	76.05905067609163
<SOS> on his first inquiry he was told , with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full , that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres . <EOS>	77.65641007013909
<SOS> then he sent his card to signor pastrini , and asked for albert de morcerf . <EOS>	100.92301816916822
<SOS> this plan succeeded ; and signor pastrini himself ran to him , excusing himself for having made his excellency wait , scolding the waiters , taking the candlestick from the porter , who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert , when morcerf himself appeared . <EOS>	62.85149718542661
<SOS> the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor . <EOS>	89.63508993077262
<SOS> the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage . <EOS>	99.12508722693661
<SOS> the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese ; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged . <EOS>	90.33169751976071
<SOS> `` very good , signor pastrini , '' said franz ; `` but we must have some supper instantly , and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days . '' <EOS>	73.87307607757835
<SOS> `` as to supper , '' replied the landlord , `` you shall be served immediately ; but as for the carriage `` `` what as to the carriage ? '' <EOS>	41.82513273783409
<SOS> exclaimed albert . <EOS>	74.20656348186314
<SOS> `` come , come , signor pastrini , no joking ; we must have a carriage . '' <EOS>	60.30670594728175
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied the host , `` we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say . '' <EOS>	50.76547182948664
<SOS> `` and when shall we know ? '' <EOS>	52.80483660276557
<SOS> inquired franz . <EOS>	111.21972533713435
<SOS> `` tomorrow morning , '' answered the innkeeper . <EOS>	64.32316753619263
<SOS> `` oh , the deuce ! <EOS>	54.83943517592728
<SOS> then we shall pay the more , that 's all , i see plainly enough . <EOS>	87.82153624252366
<SOS> at drake 's or aaron 's one pays twenty five lire for common days , and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days ; add five lire a day more for extras , that will make forty , and there 's an end of it . '' <EOS>	90.75247739680691
<SOS> `` i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage . '' <EOS>	100.3255339237492
<SOS> `` then they must put horses to mine . <EOS>	69.56799109225707
<SOS> it is a little worse for the journey , but that 's no matter . '' <EOS>	58.389044978743115
<SOS> `` there are no horses . '' <EOS>	62.11759540242726
<SOS> albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand . <EOS>	72.70382117788225
<SOS> `` do you understand that , my dear franz no horses ? '' <EOS>	92.22117414207665
<SOS> he said , `` but ca n't we have post horses ? '' <EOS>	65.34839190059384
<SOS> `` they have been all hired this fortnight , and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting . '' <EOS>	52.78607187309106
<SOS> `` what are we to say to this ? '' <EOS>	61.35933824282832
<SOS> asked franz . <EOS>	53.353087640906466
<SOS> `` i say , that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension , i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing , but to pass to another . <EOS>	70.80834446952547
<SOS> is supper ready , signor pastrini ? '' <EOS>	65.66680505112687
<SOS> `` yes , your excellency . '' <EOS>	74.64290324119823
<SOS> `` well , then , let us sup . '' <EOS>	46.54541337285598
<SOS> `` but the carriage and horses ? '' <EOS>	68.79198620593645
<SOS> said franz . <EOS>	101.65877840973343
<SOS> `` be easy , my dear boy ; they will come in due season ; it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them . '' <EOS>	83.56208636731985
<SOS> morcerf then , with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook , supped , went to bed , slept soundly , and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses . <EOS>	48.60245308286908
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	98.10870336578259
<SOS> roman bandits the next morning franz woke first , and instantly rang the bell . <EOS>	75.70236864315976
<SOS> the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered . <EOS>	76.81430282669481
<SOS> `` well , excellency , '' said the landlord triumphantly , and without waiting for franz to question him , `` i feared yesterday , when i would not promise you anything , that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is , for the three last days '' `` yes , '' returned franz , `` for the very three days it is most needed . '' <EOS>	64.97106413778704
<SOS> `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	52.95908586813736
<SOS> said albert , entering ; `` no carriage to be had ? '' <EOS>	68.33423006275795
<SOS> `` just so , '' returned franz , `` you have guessed it . '' <EOS>	79.39920125150874
<SOS> `` well , your eternal city is a nice sort of place . '' <EOS>	89.84061640590717
<SOS> `` that is to say , excellency , '' replied pastrini , who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest , `` that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening , but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please . '' <EOS>	56.48287779649107
<SOS> `` ah , that is something , '' said albert ; `` today is thursday , and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ? '' <EOS>	62.12519761041038
<SOS> `` ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive , '' replied franz , `` which will make it still more difficult . '' <EOS>	53.67933672970588
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said morcerf , `` let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future . '' <EOS>	52.33367422034629
<SOS> `` at least we can have a window ? '' <EOS>	58.60631062750884
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	64.07202583015005
<SOS> `` in the corso . '' <EOS>	59.99175666481705
<SOS> `` ah , a window ! '' <EOS>	55.79446173340865
<SOS> exclaimed signor pastrini , `` utterly impossible ; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace , and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day . '' <EOS>	106.89058094578994
<SOS> the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction . <EOS>	67.54889616770184
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz to albert , `` do you know what is the best thing we can do ? <EOS>	71.43551124020262
<SOS> it is to pass the carnival at venice ; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages . '' <EOS>	41.64883209999922
<SOS> `` ah , the devil , no , '' cried albert ; `` i came to rome to see the carnival , and i will , though i see it on stilts . '' <EOS>	87.178092517698
<SOS> `` bravo ! <EOS>	66.99611813138132
<SOS> an excellent idea . <EOS>	99.2844394465368
<SOS> we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes , and we shall have complete success . '' <EOS>	89.28491846169575
<SOS> `` do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning ? '' <EOS>	102.47236758720203
<SOS> `` parbleu ! `` <EOS>	53.173939552048175
<SOS> said albert , `` do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome , like lawyers ' clerks ? '' <EOS>	63.44511342328638
<SOS> `` i hasten to comply with your excellencies ' wishes ; only , i tell you beforehand , the carriage will cost you six piastres a day . '' <EOS>	72.77452399370623
<SOS> `` and , as i am not a millionaire , like the gentleman in the next apartments , '' said franz , `` i warn you , that as i have been four times before at rome , i know the prices of all the carriages ; we will give you twelve piastres for today , tomorrow , and the day after , and then you will make a good profit . '' <EOS>	101.19683103408555
<SOS> `` but , excellency '' said pastrini , still striving to gain his point . <EOS>	63.13785969329467
<SOS> `` now go , '' returned franz , `` or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore , who is mine also ; he is an old friend of mine , who has plundered me pretty well already , and , in the hope of making more out of me , he will take a less price than the one i offer you ; you will lose the preference , and that will be your fault . '' <EOS>	60.46189256673494
<SOS> `` do not give yourselves the trouble , excellency , '' returned signor pastrini , with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat ; `` i will do all i can , and i hope you will be satisfied . '' <EOS>	56.96960765469416
<SOS> `` and now we understand each other . '' <EOS>	79.94366660956791
<SOS> `` when do you wish the carriage to be here ? '' <EOS>	52.19845011950872
<SOS> `` in an hour . '' <EOS>	86.43910465300131
<SOS> `` in an hour it will be at the door . '' <EOS>	104.68163075527369
<SOS> an hour after the vehicle was at the door ; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion , but , in spite of its humble exterior , the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival . <EOS>	67.89422010137584
<SOS> `` excellency , '' cried the cicerone , seeing franz approach the window , `` shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace ? '' <EOS>	103.71129559493825
<SOS> accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology , his first impulse was to look round him , but these words were addressed to him . <EOS>	87.30567756236553
<SOS> franz was the `` excellency , '' the vehicle was the `` carriage , '' and the hôtel de londres was the `` palace . '' <EOS>	89.54395049531409
<SOS> the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase . <EOS>	91.7007985019452
<SOS> franz and albert descended , the carriage approached the palace ; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats ; the cicerone sprang into the seat behind . <EOS>	75.00706899230234
<SOS> `` where do your excellencies wish to go ? '' <EOS>	91.26221136152029
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	87.23388228731665
<SOS> `` to saint peter 's first , and then to the colosseum , '' returned albert . <EOS>	51.929262673743594
<SOS> but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter 's , and a month to study it . <EOS>	107.02192931755096
<SOS> the day was passed at saint peter 's alone . <EOS>	63.891579461594795
<SOS> suddenly the daylight began to fade away ; franz took out his watch it was half past four . <EOS>	44.17258687271385
<SOS> they returned to the hotel ; at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight . <EOS>	93.59545808848885
<SOS> he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight , as he had shown him saint peter 's by daylight . <EOS>	69.43374030058582
<SOS> when we show a friend a city one has already visited , we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been . <EOS>	113.49547349465678
<SOS> he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo , skirt the outer wall , and re enter by the porta san giovanni ; thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol , the forum , the arch of septimus severus , the temple of antoninus and faustina , and the via sacra . <EOS>	60.2828957000527
<SOS> they sat down to dinner . <EOS>	78.88093431278676
<SOS> signor pastrini had promised them a banquet ; he gave them a tolerable repast . <EOS>	48.57795051393479
<SOS> at the end of the dinner he entered in person . <EOS>	91.04381703467773
<SOS> franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised , and began accordingly , but at the first words he was interrupted . <EOS>	64.63463070621556
<SOS> `` excellency , '' said pastrini , `` i am delighted to have your approbation , but it was not for that i came . '' <EOS>	66.42626458818361
<SOS> `` did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage ? '' <EOS>	78.01795468067863
<SOS> asked albert , lighting his cigar . <EOS>	93.66931289129245
<SOS> `` no ; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer ; at rome things can or can not be done ; when you are told anything can not be done , there is an end of it . '' <EOS>	92.58514638299062
<SOS> `` it is much more convenient at paris , when anything can not be done , you pay double , and it is done directly . '' <EOS>	74.74893455167148
<SOS> `` that is what all the french say , '' returned signor pastrini , somewhat piqued ; `` for that reason , i do not understand why they travel . '' <EOS>	68.22454512799402
<SOS> `` but , '' said albert , emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs , `` only madmen , or blockheads like us , ever do travel . <EOS>	45.40946036704807
<SOS> men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder , their walk on the boulevard de gand , and the café de paris . '' <EOS>	79.67779466966282
<SOS> it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street , appeared every day on the fashionable walk , and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine , that is , if you are on good terms with its waiters . <EOS>	84.5691549733328
<SOS> signor pastrini remained silent a short time ; it was evident that he was musing over this answer , which did not seem very clear . <EOS>	45.906757038936014
<SOS> `` but , '' said franz , in his turn interrupting his host 's meditations , `` you had some motive for coming here , may i beg to know what it was ? '' <EOS>	61.62336123651184
<SOS> < num > m `` ah , yes ; you have ordered your carriage at eight o'clock precisely ? '' <EOS>	67.3161514412634
<SOS> `` i have . '' <EOS>	74.55756898735325
<SOS> `` you intend visiting il colosseo . '' <EOS>	52.69466625377446
<SOS> `` you mean the colosseum ? '' <EOS>	112.46698677725394
<SOS> `` it is the same thing . <EOS>	70.50761040159965
<SOS> you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo , to drive round the walls , and re enter by the porta san giovanni ? '' <EOS>	81.72785029674078
<SOS> `` these are my words exactly . '' <EOS>	62.16468940549583
<SOS> `` well , this route is impossible . '' <EOS>	96.07024637685758
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	76.33525597627553
<SOS> `` very dangerous , to say the least . '' <EOS>	72.56466212859222
<SOS> `` dangerous ! <EOS>	85.34500443846

<SOS> signor pastrini turned toward franz , who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two ; we must do him justice , he had had a great many frenchmen in his house , but had never been able to comprehend them . <EOS>	90.79494811907588

<SOS> `` my dear fellow , '' said albert , turning to franz , `` here is an admirable adventure ; we will fill our carriage with pistols , blunderbusses , and double barrelled guns . <EOS>	112.59516066279849

'' <EOS>	81.69888393042638
<SOS> whilst albert proposed this scheme , signor pastrini 's face assumed an expression impossible to describe . <EOS>	66.1492274891596
<SOS> `` and pray , '' asked franz , `` where are these pistols , blunderbusses , and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage ? '' <EOS>	58.77936269396233

<SOS> doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising , for he only answered half the question , and then he spoke to franz , as the only one likely to listen with attention . <EOS>	57.86641538230156
<SOS> `` your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits . '' <EOS>	72.88604060399251

<SOS> `` no , for it would be useless . <EOS>	79.11877444712691

<SOS> `` my dear albert , '' returned franz , `` your answer is sublime , and worthy the ' let him die , ' of corneille , only , when horace made that answer , the safety of rome was concerned ; but , as for us , it is only to gratify a whim , and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive .

<SOS> `` your excellencies permit it ? '' <EOS>	70.93407474040676

<SOS> cried albert , `` you are not a preacher , to remain standing ! '' <EOS>	77.85106880389445
<SOS> the host sat down , after having made each of them a respectful bow , which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa . <EOS>	52.6175746990526
<SOS> `` you tell me , '' said franz , at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth , `` that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man , then ? '' <EOS>	96.3830209009685

<SOS> `` of the middle height about the same stature as his excellency , '' returned the host , pointing to albert . <EOS>	93.58737709726601
<SOS> `` thanks for the comparison , '' said albert , with a bow . <EOS>	73.35790109379046
<SOS> `` go on , signor pastrini , '' continued franz , smiling at his friend 's susceptibility . <EOS>	95.68421870210757
<SOS> `` to what class of society does he belong ? '' <EOS>	66.34261131836642
<SOS> `` he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice , situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri ; he was born at pampinara , and entered the count 's service when he was five years old ; his father was also a shepherd , who owned a small flock , and lived by the wool and the milk , which he sold at rome . <EOS>	80.19294842189299
<SOS> when quite a child , the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity . <EOS>	55.15347931761803
<SOS> one day , when he was seven years old , he came to the curate of palestrina , and asked to be taught to read ; it was somewhat difficult , for he could not quit his flock ; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which , having no other name , was called borgo ; he told luigi that he might meet him on his return , and that then he would give him a lesson , warning him that it would be short , and that he must profit as much as possible by it . <EOS>	61.24029739720969
<SOS> the child accepted joyfully . <EOS>	70.3961373396674
<SOS> every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo ; every day , at nine o'clock in the morning , the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside , and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest 's breviary . <EOS>	39.192784194653505
<SOS> at the end of three months he had learned to read . <EOS>	97.19964732012913
<SOS> this was not enough he must now learn to write . <EOS>	79.42097447248541
<SOS> the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large , one middling , and one small ; and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate , and thus learn to write . <EOS>	98.31906577716461
<SOS> the same evening , when the flock was safe at the farm , the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina , took a large nail , heated and sharpened it , and formed a sort of stylus . <EOS>	81.77299794351944
<SOS> the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began . <EOS>	87.42915051435604
<SOS> at the end of three months he had learned to write . <EOS>	84.5850240311327
<SOS> the curate , astonished at his quickness and intelligence , made him a present of pens , paper , and a penknife . <EOS>	73.02208440413055
<SOS> this demanded new effort , but nothing compared to the first ; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus . <EOS>	71.60741806117773
<SOS> the curate related the incident to the count of san felice , who sent for the little shepherd , made him read and write before him , ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics , and to give him two piastres a month . <EOS>	101.52875079373727
<SOS> with this , luigi purchased books and pencils . <EOS>	88.63468016355522
<SOS> he applied his imitative powers to everything , and , like giotto , when young , he drew on his slate sheep , houses , and trees . <EOS>	45.49311172298906
<SOS> then , with his knife , he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood ; it was thus that pinelli , the famous sculptor , had commenced . <EOS>	91.60596187824832
<SOS> < num > m `` a girl of six or seven that is , a little younger than vampa tended sheep on a farm near palestrina ; she was an orphan , born at valmontone and was named teresa . <EOS>	45.88439793062316
<SOS> the two children met , sat down near each other , let their flocks mingle together , played , laughed , and conversed together ; in the evening they separated the count of san felice 's flock from those of baron cervetri , and the children returned to their respective farms , promising to meet the next morning . <EOS>	60.39303612489515
<SOS> the next day they kept their word , and thus they grew up together . <EOS>	77.62536355483991
<SOS> vampa was twelve , and teresa eleven . <EOS>	105.58886678811751
<SOS> and yet their natural disposition revealed itself . <EOS>	77.81147141960122
<SOS> beside his taste for the fine arts , which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude , he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm , was often angry and capricious , and always sarcastic . <EOS>	77.04933117647049
<SOS> none of the lads of pampinara , palestrina , or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion . <EOS>	81.18093444550877
<SOS> his disposition ( always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them ) kept him aloof from all friendships . <EOS>	87.4461610866956
<SOS> teresa alone ruled by a look , a word , a gesture , this impetuous character , which yielded beneath the hand of a woman , and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken , but could never have been bended . <EOS>	67.426643281615
<SOS> teresa was lively and gay , but coquettish to excess . <EOS>	56.844716409159794
<SOS> the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice 's steward , and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome , were expended in ear rings , necklaces , and gold hairpins . <EOS>	109.26754830561978
<SOS> so that , thanks to her friend 's generosity , teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome . <EOS>	63.24278015883863
<SOS> `` the two children grew up together , passing all their time with each other , and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters . <EOS>	76.3737692341861
<SOS> thus , in all their dreams , their wishes , and their conversations , vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel , general of an army , or governor of a province . <EOS>	88.79191482053207
<SOS> teresa saw herself rich , superbly attired , and attended by a train of liveried domestics . <EOS>	45.61671091439586
<SOS> then , when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air , they separated their flocks , and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position . <EOS>	58.427758354745485
<SOS> `` one day the young shepherd told the count 's steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains , and prowl around his flock . <EOS>	82.93104152347775
<SOS> the steward gave him a gun ; this was what vampa longed for . <EOS>	63.39595197878193
<SOS> this gun had an excellent barrel , made at brescia , and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle ; but one day the count broke the stock , and had then cast the gun aside . <EOS>	50.24368421793701
<SOS> this , however , was nothing to a sculptor like vampa ; he examined the broken stock , calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder , and made a fresh stock , so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres , had he chosen to sell it . <EOS>	107.71864632637399
<SOS> but nothing could be farther from his thoughts . <EOS>	68.70602770050763
<SOS> `` for a long time a gun had been the young man 's greatest ambition . <EOS>	63.357050924732
<SOS> in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty , the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon , which at once renders him capable of defence or attack , and , by rendering its owner terrible , often makes him feared . <EOS>	54.12968752736086
<SOS> from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon ; he purchased powder and ball , and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree , that grew on the sabine mountains ; the fox , as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion ; the eagle that soared above their heads : and thus he soon became so expert , that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report , and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased , with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand . <EOS>	78.53508908810143
<SOS> < num > m `` one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed , but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead . <EOS>	86.94893303715027
<SOS> proud of this exploit , vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders , and carried him to the farm . <EOS>	75.64996071961579

<SOS> the man of superior abilities always finds admirers , go where he will . <EOS>	88.74410427689092
<SOS> he was spoken of as the most adroit , the strongest , and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around ; and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines , no one had ever spoken to her of love , because it was known that she was beloved by vampa . <EOS>	46.86312267430394
<SOS> and yet the two young people had never declared their affection ; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled , whose branches intertwined , and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens . <EOS>	92.38100525593852
<SOS> only their wish to see each other had become a necessity , and they would have preferred death to a day 's separation . <EOS>	55.392158263373396

<SOS> inquired the bandits with astonishment . <EOS>	74.67819739729315
<SOS> `` ' i come to ask to be your captain , ' said the young man . <EOS>	86.41101608730318

<SOS> `` 'and what have you done to aspire to this honor ? ' <EOS>	81.40545316393444
<SOS> demanded the lieutenant . <EOS>	60.66567460086972
<SOS> `` ' i have killed your chief , cucumetto , whose dress i now wear ; and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed . ' <EOS>	76.92099885989762
<SOS> `` an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain , vice cucumetto , deceased . '' <EOS>	103.34653297828392

<SOS> `` i say he is a myth , '' replied albert , `` and never had an existence . '' <EOS>	61.79257436695721
<SOS> `` and what may a myth be ? '' <EOS>	96.57068635991135
<SOS> inquired pastrini . <EOS>	81.13179170343429
<SOS> `` the explanation would be too long , my dear landlord , '' replied franz . <EOS>	98.943292236368
<SOS> `` and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome ? '' <EOS>	93.1996187832663
<SOS> `` and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example . '' <EOS>	90.34198909924523
<SOS> `` then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him ? '' <EOS>	83.51449678209822
<SOS> `` why , you see , he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains , the fishermen of the tiber , and the smugglers of the coast . <EOS>	60.15840148254267
<SOS> they seek for him in the mountains , and he is on the waters ; they follow him on the waters , and he is on the open sea ; then they pursue him , and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands , at giglio , giannutri , or monte cristo ; and when they hunt for him there , he reappears suddenly at albano , tivoli , or la riccia . '' <EOS>	61.936932322028454
<SOS> `` and how does he behave towards travellers ? '' <EOS>	52.33011310063628
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	86.70064693316809
<SOS> his plan is very simple . <EOS>	103.51403242013242
<SOS> it depends on the distance he may be from the city , whether he gives eight hours , twelve hours , or a day wherein to pay their ransom ; and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour 's grace . <EOS>	39.665612277260294
<SOS> at the sixtieth minute of this hour , if the money is not forthcoming , he blows out the prisoner 's brains with a pistol shot , or plants his dagger in his heart , and that settles the account . '' <EOS>	74.00874627486444
<SOS> `` well , albert , '' inquired franz of his companion , `` are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall ? '' <EOS>	66.12953833046525
<SOS> `` quite so , '' said albert , `` if the way be picturesque . '' <EOS>	68.61292469656867
<SOS> the clock struck nine as the door opened , and a coachman appeared . <EOS>	51.87104424554349
<SOS> `` excellencies , '' said he , `` the coach is ready . '' <EOS>	114.06945291363263
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said franz , `` let us to the colosseum . '' <EOS>	81.74828166826074
<SOS> `` by the porta del popolo or by the streets , your excellencies ? '' <EOS>	69.45991229018915
<SOS> `` by the streets , morbleu ! <EOS>	80.37097281286431
<SOS> by the streets ! '' <EOS>	70.61922258129711
<SOS> cried franz . <EOS>	49.25519356904633
<SOS> `` ah , my dear fellow , '' said albert , rising , and lighting his third cigar , `` really , i thought you had more courage . '' <EOS>	55.851438671104624
<SOS> so saying , the two young men went down the staircase , and got into the carriage . <EOS>	97.5570578422909
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	68.64903540011802
<SOS> the colosseum franz had so managed his route , that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin , so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire . <EOS>	70.46752073250212
<SOS> the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina ; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli , the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum . <EOS>	95.57737244931705
<SOS> this itinerary possessed another great advantage , that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini 's story , in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up . <EOS>	86.88840738435296
<SOS> seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage , he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to , and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without , however , arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them . <EOS>	49.95184204074872
<SOS> one fact more than the rest brought his friend `` sinbad the sailor '' back to his recollection , and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors ; and pastrini 's account of vampa 's having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen , reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht , which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them . <EOS>	79.7227507071063
<SOS> the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres , abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino , civita vecchia , ostia , and gaëta , as on those of corsica , tuscany , and spain ; and further , franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo , proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended . <EOS>	108.64539667047693
<SOS> but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections , they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum , through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead . <EOS>	68.72590134760887
<SOS> the carriage stopped near the meta sudans ; the door was opened , and the young men , eagerly alighting , found themselves opposite a cicerone , who appeared to have sprung up from the ground , so unexpected was his appearance . <EOS>	80.28674333362662
<SOS> the usual guide from the hotel having followed them , they had paid two conductors , nor is it possible , at rome , to avoid this abundant supply of guides ; besides the ordinary cicerone , who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel , and never quits you while you remain in the city , there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay , almost to each part of a monument . <EOS>	86.88566953016759
<SOS> it may , therefore , be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum , that wonder of all ages , which martial thus eulogizes : `` let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids , and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us ; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars , and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument . '' <EOS>	67.60203477833863
<SOS> as for albert and franz , they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants ; and , indeed , it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage , as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands . <EOS>	95.04254785197345
<SOS> thus , then , the young men made no attempt at resistance , but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors . <EOS>	99.29170504097677
<SOS> franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum , while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian ; and , to his credit be it spoken , his mind , even amid the glib loquacity of the guides , was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw ; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them , and more especially by moonlight , at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky , whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime . <EOS>	70.62077329836521
<SOS> scarcely , therefore , had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin , when , abandoning albert to the guides ( who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down , and as regularly followed by them , but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal , beginning , as a matter of course , with the `` lions ' den '' , the `` hall of the gladiators '' and finishing with `` cæsar 's podium '' ) , to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded , franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase , and , leaving them to follow their monotonous round , seated himself at the foot of a column , and immediately opposite a large aperture , which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin . <EOS>	69.48417932914076
<SOS> franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place , and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides , who , holding torches in their hands , had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum , and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins , resembling , as they glided along , some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui . <EOS>	88.02086921697467
<SOS> all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended . <EOS>	65.67853917766506
<SOS> there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below ; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot , and also that someone , who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard , was approaching the spot where he sat . <EOS>	72.637850544802
<SOS> conjecture soon became certainty , for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz , gradually emerging from the staircase opposite , upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness . <EOS>	71.27404717421959
<SOS> the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who , like franz , preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides . <EOS>	96.67745854023629
<SOS> and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person . <EOS>	57.76947735074052
<SOS> by a sort of instinctive impulse , franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar . <EOS>	47.39013964249124
<SOS> about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were , the roof had given way , leaving a large round opening , through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven , thickly studded with stars . <EOS>	63.137181951999366
<SOS> around this opening , which had , possibly , for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile , grew a quantity of creeping plants , whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament , while large masses of thick , strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm , and hung floating to and fro , like so many waving strings . <EOS>	77.31084331481046
<SOS> the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light , that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features , although his dress was easily made out . <EOS>	97.2485724572643
<SOS> he wore a large brown mantle , one fold of which , thrown over his left shoulder , served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance , while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat . <EOS>	59.06850314957482
<SOS> the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon , which , entering through the broken ceiling , shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather , over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth . <EOS>	90.26545499846476
<SOS> < num > m from the imperfect means franz had of judging , he could only come to one conclusion , that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life . <EOS>	81.31042801998441
<SOS> some few minutes had elapsed , and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience , when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof , and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it , and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him ; then , as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle , he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs , and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground , and then leaped lightly on his feet . <EOS>	57.69280515532085
<SOS> the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume . <EOS>	52.657446137803454
<SOS> `` i beg your excellency 's pardon for keeping you waiting , '' said the man , in the roman dialect , `` but i do n't think i 'm many minutes after my time , ten o'clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran . '' <EOS>	65.54877804851373
<SOS> `` say not a word about being late , '' replied the stranger in purest tuscan ; `` 't is i who am too soon . <EOS>	45.157530043105815
<SOS> but even if you had caused me to wait a little while , i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours . '' <EOS>	59.13797255954176
<SOS> `` your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking , '' said the man ; `` i came here direct from the castle of st. angelo , and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo . '' <EOS>	39.455211416179296
<SOS> `` and who is beppo ? '' <EOS>	61.8322438114441
<SOS> `` oh , beppo is employed in the prison , and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness 's castle . '' <EOS>	89.08262367366032
<SOS> `` indeed ! <EOS>	47.945701322651914
<SOS> you are a provident person , i see . '' <EOS>	68.38887029256944
<SOS> `` why , you see , no one knows what may happen . <EOS>	74.88717102025186
<SOS> perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped , like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net , and so help me out of prison . '' <EOS>	87.24591675071866
<SOS> `` briefly , what did you learn ? '' <EOS>	60.9619529304466
<SOS> `` that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o'clock , as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals . <EOS>	81.68798694973378
<SOS> one of the culprits will be mazzolato ; < num > he is an atrocious villain , who murdered the priest who brought him up , and deserves not the smallest pity . <EOS>	64.05992419124838
<SOS> the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato ; < num > and he , your excellency , is poor peppino . '' <EOS>	47.38259142934672
<SOS> `` the fact is , that you have inspired not only the pontifical government , but also the neighboring states , with such extreme fear , that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example . '' <EOS>	85.3125617916185
<SOS> `` but peppino did not even belong to my band ; he was merely a poor shepherd , whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions . '' <EOS>	104.34270510743234
<SOS> `` which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes . <EOS>	83.43326741152103
<SOS> but mark the distinction with which he is treated ; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you , he is simply sentenced to be guillotined , by which means , too , the amusements of the day are diversified , and there is a spectacle to please every spectator . '' <EOS>	98.24028043944207
<SOS> `` without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with . '' <EOS>	97.6256517293613
<SOS> `` my good friend , '' said the man in the cloak , `` excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act . '' <EOS>	84.38938707159176
<SOS> `` perhaps i am ; but one thing i have resolved on , and that is , to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty , who has got into this scrape solely from having served me . <EOS>	49.639848788668324
<SOS> i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity . '' <EOS>	87.10665556069904
<SOS> `` and what do you mean to do ? '' <EOS>	103.32659209347908
<SOS> `` to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men , who , at a signal from me , will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution , and , by the assistance of their stilettos , drive back the guard , and carry off the prisoner . '' <EOS>	46.59289192138426
<SOS> `` that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain , and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours . '' <EOS>	65.96288480522878
<SOS> `` and what is your excellency 's project ? '' <EOS>	63.29560083496207

<SOS> `` pardieu ! `` <EOS>	98.48734371743367
<SOS> exclaimed the man in the cloak , suddenly expressing himself in french . <EOS>	80.55224959921826
<SOS> `` what did your excellency say ? '' <EOS>	56.04165004213173
<SOS> inquired the other . <EOS>	70.05267652942192
<SOS> `` i said , my good fellow , that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos , pistols , carbines , and blunderbusses included . <EOS>	97.80938252460446
<SOS> leave me , then , to act , and have no fears for the result . '' <EOS>	73.06137111460902

<SOS> `` oh , that is very easily arranged . <EOS>	47.58651310344186

<SOS> `` and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution ? '' <EOS>	58.86095753963956
<SOS> `` send one of your men , disguised as a penitent friar , and i will give it to him . <EOS>	92.2024192274173
<SOS> his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself , and he will deliver the official order to the officer , who , in his turn , will hand it to the executioner ; in the meantime , it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on , if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses , because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred . '' <EOS>	72.39915865311357
<SOS> `` your excellency , '' said the man , `` you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you , are you not ? '' <EOS>	74.48497337225892

<SOS> `` have a care how far you pledge yourself , my good friend , for i may remind you of your promise at some , perhaps , not very distant period , when i , in my turn , may require your aid and influence . '' <EOS>	73.6497141295595

<SOS> interrupted the stranger ; `` i hear a noise . '' <EOS>	89.64860520266275
<SOS> `` 't is some travellers , who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight . '' <EOS>	65.23143867204226

<SOS> adieu , your excellency ; depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you . '' <EOS>	72.73257519072695
<SOS> saying these words , the transteverin disappeared down the staircase , while his companion , muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle , passed almost close to franz , and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps . <EOS>	111.10388956613946
<SOS> the next minute franz heard himself called by albert , who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friend 's name . <EOS>	88.707274871457
<SOS> franz , however , did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent . <EOS>	88.9276877607337
<SOS> in ten minutes after the strangers had departed , franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna , listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert , after the manner of pliny and calpurnius , touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators . <EOS>	71.32865746639966
<SOS> franz let him proceed without interruption , and , in fact , did not hear what was said ; he longed to be alone , and free to ponder over all that had occurred . <EOS>	80.40439747843045
<SOS> one of the two men , whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed , was an entire stranger to him , but not so the other ; and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features , from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow , the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them , hear them when or where he might . <EOS>	54.23638924313349
<SOS> it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting , half bitter , that franz 's ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous , yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo , and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum . <EOS>	58.69881773108161
<SOS> and the more he thought , the more entire was his conviction , that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer , `` sinbad the sailor . '' <EOS>	58.062372532806144
<SOS> < num > m under any other circumstances , franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage , and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance ; but in the present instance , the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him , with propriety , judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable . <EOS>	77.02216905339512
<SOS> as we have seen , therefore , he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition , but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity . <EOS>	86.91775948748452
<SOS> in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him ; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep . <EOS>	116.43271457722605
<SOS> slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo ; and the more he thought , the firmer grew his opinion on the subject . <EOS>	91.83878585714078
<SOS> worn out at length , he fell asleep at daybreak , and did not awake till late . <EOS>	94.58350659935222
<SOS> like a genuine frenchman , albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening 's diversion ; he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina ; and franz , having a number of letters to write , relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day . <EOS>	62.63955390413967
<SOS> at five o'clock albert returned , delighted with his day 's work ; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction , and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept ; besides this , he had seen ( as he called it ) all the remarkable sights at rome . <EOS>	55.7554508016198
<SOS> yes , in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect . <EOS>	104.46820808252444
<SOS> neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina , and also what performers appeared in it . <EOS>	95.40467051785998
<SOS> the opera of parisina was announced for representation , and the principal actors were coselli , moriani , and la specchia . <EOS>	71.24219478746569
<SOS> the young men , therefore , had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor , supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy . <EOS>	89.6252313896103
<SOS> albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres , with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see , and the absence of balconies , or open boxes ; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes , and had shared a lower box at the opera . <EOS>	91.00488826296072
<SOS> still , in spite of this , albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres ; but , alas , his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away , and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure . <EOS>	47.11337264809315
<SOS> sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success ; but internally he was deeply wounded , and his self love immensely piqued , to think that albert de morcerf , the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day , should thus be passed over , and merely have his labor for his pains . <EOS>	54.67858558319777
<SOS> and the thing was so much the more annoying , as , according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman , albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him , and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs . <EOS>	79.70883980825832
<SOS> alas , poor albert ! <EOS>	96.29813274415966
<SOS> none of those interesting adventures fell in his way ; the lovely genoese , florentines , and neapolitans were all faithful , if not to their husbands , at least to their lovers , and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf ; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france , that they are faithful even in their infidelity . <EOS>	79.81519289386726
<SOS> yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy , as elsewhere , there might be an exception to the general rule . <EOS>	84.60447853577462
<SOS> albert , besides being an elegant , well looking young man , was also possessed of considerable talent and ability ; moreover , he was a viscount a recently created one , certainly , but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent , and a genealogical tree is equally estimated , whether dated from < num > or merely < num > ; but to crown all these advantages , albert de morcerf commanded an income of < num > , < num > livres , a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris . <EOS>	52.490725124033446
<SOS> it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation . <EOS>	61.80506034068185
<SOS> albert , however , hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival , knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated , rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives , and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation . <EOS>	74.1199900270071
<SOS> the carnival was to commence on the morrow ; therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes , expectations , and claims to notice . <EOS>	65.53420088597137
<SOS> with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre , and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet . <EOS>	103.3181521672433
<SOS> the box taken by albert was in the first circle ; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic , and is , for this reason , generally styled the `` nobility 's boxes , '' and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons , it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants . <EOS>	73.52404881546637
<SOS> another motive had influenced albert 's selection of his seat , who knew but that , thus advantageously placed , he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman , and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage , or a place in a princely balcony , from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival ? <EOS>	82.57743683426865
<SOS> these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been . <EOS>	80.6669532090678
<SOS> totally disregarding the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman , aided by a powerful opera glass ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing , were all so much engrossed with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass . <EOS>	57.00519376576026
<SOS> the truth was , that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival , with the `` holy week '' that was to succeed it , so filled every fair breast , as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage . <EOS>	73.87795593214342
<SOS> the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of ; at certain conventional moments , the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation , or rouse themselves from their musings , to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani 's , a well executed recitative by coselli , or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia ; but that momentary excitement over , they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation . <EOS>	72.32251524429961
<SOS> towards the close of the first act , the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened ; a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris , where indeed , he had imagined she still was . <EOS>	76.46507843441188
<SOS> the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival , and , turning to him , he said hastily : `` do you know the woman who has just entered that box ? '' <EOS>	74.36117557646989
<SOS> `` yes ; what do you think of her ? '' <EOS>	87.53093474424091
<SOS> `` oh , she is perfectly lovely what a complexion ! <EOS>	80.74647534899186
<SOS> and such magnificent hair ! <EOS>	98.39006550465268
<SOS> is she french ? '' <EOS>	108.64203114613937
<SOS> `` no ; a venetian . '' <EOS>	81.8888888785269
<SOS> `` and her name is `` `` countess g . '' <EOS>	78.05234840041918
<SOS> `` ah , i know her by name ! '' <EOS>	88.4169457512901
<SOS> exclaimed albert ; `` she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty . <EOS>	54.57588224075348
<SOS> i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefort 's ball . '' <EOS>	114.07983813143115
<SOS> `` shall i assist you in repairing your negligence ? '' <EOS>	59.16531129245899
<SOS> asked franz . <EOS>	56.89115885332799
<SOS> `` my dear fellow , are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box ? '' <EOS>	72.08642640113652
<SOS> `` why , i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life ; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask . '' <EOS>	77.19886927447469
<SOS> at that instant , the countess perceived franz , and graciously waved her hand to him , to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head . <EOS>	75.42827634787277
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' said albert , `` you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess . '' <EOS>	101.06871262990026
<SOS> `` you are mistaken in thinking so , '' returned franz calmly ; `` but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders , i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions ; believe me , nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon ; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more . '' <EOS>	79.49390184952591
<SOS> `` is there , indeed , my good fellow ? <EOS>	107.31191765167857
<SOS> pray tell me , is it sympathy of heart ? '' <EOS>	116.69531360275568
<SOS> `` no ; of taste , '' continued franz gravely . <EOS>	78.65387448308482
<SOS> `` and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced ? '' <EOS>	74.45897153294347
<SOS> `` by the countess 's visiting the colosseum , as we did last night , by moonlight , and nearly alone . '' <EOS>	89.50033613662215
<SOS> `` you were with her , then ? '' <EOS>	99.31943614303887
<SOS> `` i was . '' <EOS>	77.65943004273403
<SOS> `` and what did you say to her ? '' <EOS>	67.15268811916934
<SOS> `` oh , we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument ! '' <EOS>	113.77224292908637
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' cried albert , `` you must have been a very entertaining companion alone , or all but alone , with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum , and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead ! <EOS>	82.66233432305066
<SOS> all i can say is , if ever i should get such a chance , the living should be my theme . '' <EOS>	65.98542920166264
<SOS> < num > m `` and you will probably find your theme ill chosen . '' <EOS>	76.07956735572125
<SOS> `` but , '' said albert , breaking in upon his discourse , `` never mind the past ; let us only remember the present . <EOS>	64.63707997745584
<SOS> are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks ? '' <EOS>	86.52071031747072
<SOS> `` certainly , directly the curtain falls on the stage . '' <EOS>	71.31861459426295
<SOS> `` what a confounded long time this first act lasts . <EOS>	70.11145583841201
<SOS> i believe , on my soul , that they never mean to finish it . '' <EOS>	79.38025732460405
<SOS> `` oh , yes , they will ; only listen to that charming finale . <EOS>	106.34078756762169
<SOS> how exquisitely coselli sings his part . '' <EOS>	72.8366278894971
<SOS> `` but what an awkward , inelegant fellow he is . '' <EOS>	79.62147361284208
<SOS> `` well , then , what do you say to la specchia ? <EOS>	60.26282266149485
<SOS> did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting ? '' <EOS>	55.19589632799854
<SOS> `` why , you know , my dear fellow , when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag , such singers as these do n't make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others . '' <EOS>	53.70794354226717
<SOS> `` at least , you must admire moriani 's style and execution . '' <EOS>	46.202482987315086
<SOS> `` i never fancied men of his dark , ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman 's . '' <EOS>	74.57594365713518
<SOS> `` my good friend , '' said franz , turning to him , while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre , `` you seem determined not to approve ; you are really too difficult to please . '' <EOS>	91.13857485178906
<SOS> the curtain at length fell on the performances , to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf , who seized his hat , rapidly passed his fingers through his hair , arranged his cravat and wristbands , and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way . <EOS>	83.84394169012468
<SOS> franz , who had mutely interrogated the countess , and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome , sought not to retard the gratification of albert 's eager impatience , but began at once the tour of the house , closely followed by albert , who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar , and to arrange the lappets of his coat . <EOS>	85.83186425683492
<SOS> this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess 's box . <EOS>	77.6611991505528
<SOS> at the knock , the door was immediately opened , and the young man who was seated beside the countess , in obedience to the italian custom , instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers , who , in turn , would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors . <EOS>	42.34776992506085
<SOS> franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day , both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents ; nor did he say more than the truth , for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved , he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection . <EOS>	114.5354841063587
<SOS> franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him ( franz ) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so . <EOS>	55.011029169934375
<SOS> the countess , in reply , bowed gracefully to albert , and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz ; then , inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her , she recommended franz to take the next best , if he wished to view the ballet , and pointed to the one behind her own chair . <EOS>	52.17014971783128
<SOS> albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters , speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there . <EOS>	115.3710713434376
<SOS> franz perceived how completely he was in his element ; and , unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt , took up albert 's glass , and began in his turn to survey the audience . <EOS>	104.85095686074945
<SOS> sitting alone , in the front of a box immediately opposite , but situated on the third row , was a woman of exquisite beauty , dressed in a greek costume , which evidently , from the ease and grace with which she wore it , was her national attire . <EOS>	95.78749228309434
<SOS> behind her , but in deep shadow , was the outline of a masculine figure ; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish . <EOS>	113.30147838021877
<SOS> franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert , to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite , since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex . <EOS>	72.10519954917643
<SOS> `` all i can tell about her , '' replied the countess , `` is , that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season ; for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season , and since then she has never missed a performance . <EOS>	54.27315658932896
<SOS> sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her , and at others she is merely attended by a black servant . '' <EOS>	120.03652106037212
<SOS> `` and what do you think of her personal appearance ? '' <EOS>	50.914050120075764
<SOS> `` oh , i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been . '' <EOS>	71.6320499646171
<SOS> franz and the countess exchanged a smile , and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert , while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company . <EOS>	75.15464952856846
<SOS> the curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet , from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary , are all engaged on the stage at the same time ; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude , or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of volition , influenced the moving mass . <EOS>	43.480395998257244
<SOS> the ballet was called poliska . <EOS>	79.52986936650045
<SOS> however much the ballet might have claimed his attention , franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it ; while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it , her eager , animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion , who , during the whole time the piece lasted , never even moved , not even when the furious , crashing din produced by the trumpets , cymbals , and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra . <EOS>	66.3936259043087
<SOS> of this he took no heed , but was , as far as appearances might be trusted , enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams . <EOS>	62.247870573968115
<SOS> the ballet at length came to a close , and the curtain fell amid the loud , unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience . <EOS>	70.64316096960732
<SOS> owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet , the pauses between the performances are very short , the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume , when necessary , while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps . <EOS>	73.30842273193844
<SOS> the overture to the second act began ; and , at the first sound of the leader 's bow across his violin , franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl , who turned around to say a few words to him , and then , leaning forward again on the railing of her box , she became as absorbed as before in what was going on . <EOS>	68.58606951608647
<SOS> the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade , that , though franz tried his utmost , he could not distinguish a single feature . <EOS>	50.789413800748754
<SOS> the curtain rose , and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors ; and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage . <EOS>	78.85040234057735
<SOS> most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina , while sleeping , betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo . <EOS>	84.11012677905717
<SOS> the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy , until conviction seizes on his mind , and then , in a frenzy of rage and indignation , he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance . <EOS>	95.77293767532139
<SOS> this duet is one of the most beautiful , expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti . <EOS>	79.2089843013605
<SOS> franz now listened to it for the third time ; yet its notes , so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions , thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it . <EOS>	41.75468954036777
<SOS> excited beyond his usual calm demeanor , franz rose with the audience , and was about to join the loud , enthusiastic applause that followed ; but suddenly his purpose was arrested , his hands fell by his sides , and the half uttered `` bravos '' expired on his lips . <EOS>	81.68575082686486
<SOS> the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed ; for he left his seat to stand up in front , so that , his countenance being fully revealed , franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo , and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum , and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him . <EOS>	98.95726652800822
<SOS> all doubt of his identity was now at an end ; his singular host evidently resided at rome . <EOS>	61.896303034060715
<SOS> the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz 's former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features ; for the countess , after gazing with a puzzled look at his face , burst into a fit of laughter , and begged to know what had happened . <EOS>	65.4038051967127
<SOS> `` countess , '' returned franz , totally unheeding her raillery , `` i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite ; i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband ? '' <EOS>	88.81985402163485
<SOS> `` nay , '' answered the countess , `` i know no more of him than yourself . '' <EOS>	65.72371505787808
<SOS> `` perhaps you never before noticed him ? '' <EOS>	81.81570796952262
<SOS> `` what a question so truly french ! <EOS>	65.62836574688605
<SOS> do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love ? '' <EOS>	84.44318379656673
<SOS> `` true , '' replied franz . <EOS>	70.07404522881954
<SOS> `` all i can say is , '' continued the countess , taking up the lorgnette , and directing it toward the box in question , `` that the gentleman , whose history i am unable to furnish , seems to me as though he had just been dug up ; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while , and revisit this earth of ours , than anything human . <EOS>	59.210994825728214
<SOS> how ghastly pale he is ! '' <EOS>	80.58010831583732
<SOS> `` oh , he is always as colorless as you now see him , '' said franz . <EOS>	67.1079430677947
<SOS> `` then you know him ? '' <EOS>	52.20397815038648
<SOS> almost screamed the countess . <EOS>	71.85287816722955
<SOS> `` oh , pray do , for heaven 's sake , tell us all about is he a vampire , or a resuscitated corpse , or what ? '' <EOS>	98.87567915325964
<SOS> `` i fancy i have seen him before ; and i even think he recognizes me . '' <EOS>	67.30089867190446
<SOS> `` and i can well understand , '' said the countess , shrugging up her beautiful shoulders , as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins , `` that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him . '' <EOS>	92.89972669246902
<SOS> the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself ; another , and wholly uninterested person , felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving . <EOS>	61.191292026353565
<SOS> `` well . '' <EOS>	52.6494479453307
<SOS> inquired franz , after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box , `` what do you think of our opposite neighbor ? '' <EOS>	55.416698347886715
<SOS> < num > m `` why , that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form . '' <EOS>	69.13721255878761
<SOS> this fresh allusion to byron < num > drew a smile to franz 's countenance ; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires , it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . <EOS>	52.66965650220979
<SOS> `` i must positively find out who and what he is , '' said franz , rising from his seat . <EOS>	41.87469622249233
<SOS> `` no , no , '' cried the countess ; `` you must not leave me . <EOS>	91.78650423814527
<SOS> i depend upon you to escort me home . <EOS>	79.7248890192201
<SOS> oh , indeed , i can not permit you to go . '' <EOS>	107.53333436581066
<SOS> `` is it possible , '' whispered franz , `` that you entertain any fear ? '' <EOS>	108.81612698571115
<SOS> `` i 'll tell you , '' answered the countess . <EOS>	65.83395356081762
<SOS> `` byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires , and even assured me that he had seen them . <EOS>	91.98579102423892
<SOS> the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us . <EOS>	84.30165582330177
<SOS> oh , he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect ! <EOS>	97.53779846409657
<SOS> the coal black hair , large bright , glittering eyes , in which a wild , unearthly fire seems burning , the same ghastly paleness . <EOS>	77.55361477741396
<SOS> then observe , too , that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex . <EOS>	109.83786241867712
<SOS> she is a foreigner a stranger . <EOS>	61.23412170931914
<SOS> nobody knows who she is , or where she comes from . <EOS>	71.81508756068004
<SOS> no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does , and is , like himself , a dealer in magical arts . <EOS>	88.40579918188206
<SOS> i entreat of you not to go near him at least tonight ; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great , pursue your researches if you will ; but tonight you neither can nor shall . <EOS>	44.04819089128972
<SOS> for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself . '' <EOS>	87.10978521350557
<SOS> franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day , for many reasons . <EOS>	73.88730070383028
<SOS> `` listen to me , '' said the countess , `` and do not be so very headstrong . <EOS>	105.38806476207907
<SOS> i am going home . <EOS>	96.4303578255132
<SOS> i have a party at my house tonight , and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera . <EOS>	83.01414810847535
<SOS> now , i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it . '' <EOS>	101.92777559843802
<SOS> there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat , open the door of the box , and offer the countess his arm . <EOS>	80.48858389635872
<SOS> it was quite evident , by her manner , that her uneasiness was not feigned ; and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him , as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections , while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief , originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths . <EOS>	73.20751712493694
<SOS> franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage . <EOS>	47.448560569431066
<SOS> upon arriving at her hotel , franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company ; on the contrary , her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants . <EOS>	57.15957641954103
<SOS> `` excuse my little subterfuge , '' said the countess , in reply to her companion 's half reproachful observation on the subject ; `` but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable , and i longed to be alone , that i might compose my startled mind . '' <EOS>	73.22034639541569
<SOS> franz essayed to smile . <EOS>	86.30947301504804
<SOS> `` nay , '' said she , `` do not smile ; it ill accords with the expression of your countenance , and i am sure it does not spring from your heart . <EOS>	117.58884527778127
<SOS> however , promise me one thing . '' <EOS>	85.53724703566961
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	74.78263776164567
<SOS> `` promise me , i say . '' <EOS>	77.2801840106071
<SOS> `` i will do anything you desire , except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is . <EOS>	61.8676511662144
<SOS> i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is , from whence he came , and whither he is going . '' <EOS>	91.18783378991729
<SOS> `` where he comes from i am ignorant ; but i can readily tell you where he is going to , and that is down below , without the least doubt . '' <EOS>	88.6471024572457
<SOS> `` let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make , '' said franz . <EOS>	75.00795614889229
<SOS> `` well , then , you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel , and make no attempt to follow this man tonight . <EOS>	45.80122414259448
<SOS> there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards . <EOS>	73.82802814260533
<SOS> for heaven 's sake , do not serve as a conductor between that man and me . <EOS>	63.15408619023316
<SOS> pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please ; but never bring him near me , if you would not see me die of terror . <EOS>	48.02604839243346
<SOS> and now , good night ; go to your rooms , and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening . <EOS>	67.85923032639764
<SOS> for my own part , i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes . '' <EOS>	89.85857347602887
<SOS> so saying , the countess quitted franz , leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense , or whether her fears and agitations were genuine . <EOS>	70.31726480588453
<SOS> upon his return to the hotel , franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers , listlessly extended on a sofa , smoking a cigar . <EOS>	44.89318590182735
<SOS> `` my dear fellow ! '' <EOS>	89.42962597636873
<SOS> cried he , springing up , `` is it really you ? <EOS>	58.94773701676805
<SOS> why , i did not expect to see you before tomorrow . '' <EOS>	73.2487455855852
<SOS> `` my dear albert , '' replied franz , `` i am glad of this opportunity to tell you , once and forever , that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women . <EOS>	63.94424040228541
<SOS> i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time . '' <EOS>	46.056462755018096
<SOS> `` upon my soul , these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright . <EOS>	68.49391107151432
<SOS> why , here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home . <EOS>	95.256448153983
<SOS> why , if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention , her reputation would be gone forever . '' <EOS>	100.02123837183387
<SOS> `` and the very reason why the women of this fine country , 'where sounds the si , ' as dante writes , put so little restraint on their words and actions , is because they live so much in public , and have really nothing to conceal . <EOS>	83.65306837506233
<SOS> besides , you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed . '' <EOS>	71.45077155227902
<SOS> `` at what ? <EOS>	58.41119040820055
<SOS> at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl ? <EOS>	54.0487255694579
<SOS> now , for my part , i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece ; and hang me , if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from . <EOS>	63.41008574207755
<SOS> i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed . <EOS>	70.54886872835377
<SOS> indeed , i feel quite sure , from the cut of his clothes , they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann . <EOS>	104.23628787367495
<SOS> he was rather too pale , certainly ; but then , you know , paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding . '' <EOS>	51.06520836987311
<SOS> franz smiled ; for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion . <EOS>	80.38657276521415
<SOS> `` well , that tends to confirm my own ideas , '' said franz , `` that the countess 's suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason . <EOS>	86.67799705308231
<SOS> did he speak in your hearing ? <EOS>	70.79947741637824
<SOS> and did you catch any of his words ? '' <EOS>	103.53507169823403
<SOS> `` i did ; but they were uttered in the romaic dialect . <EOS>	113.14230071451901
<SOS> i knew that from the mixture of greek words . <EOS>	49.849044900428055
<SOS> i do n't know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek . '' <EOS>	81.74060897192132
<SOS> `` he spoke the romaic language , did he ? '' <EOS>	63.27203468588932
<SOS> `` i think so . '' <EOS>	65.94628740548696
<SOS> `` that settles it , '' murmured franz . <EOS>	61.778495772506396
<SOS> `` 't is he , past all doubt . '' <EOS>	86.04204764004831
<SOS> `` what do you say ? '' <EOS>	78.0988013155627
<SOS> `` nothing , nothing . <EOS>	64.92760816134398
<SOS> but tell me , what were you thinking about when i came in ? '' <EOS>	87.5908719728935
<SOS> `` oh , i was arranging a little surprise for you . '' <EOS>	119.57972463478777
<SOS> `` indeed . <EOS>	82.85158161716667
<SOS> of what nature ? '' <EOS>	72.16896469013702
<SOS> `` why , you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage . '' <EOS>	90.85613698812625
<SOS> `` certainly ; and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one . '' <EOS>	45.58344651763752
<SOS> `` now , then , in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain . '' <EOS>	51.117535260340034
<SOS> franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination . <EOS>	53.036811536714154
<SOS> `` i tell you what , m. franz , '' cried albert , `` you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now . '' <EOS>	52.18434300776426
<SOS> `` and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert . '' <EOS>	70.77558334484932
<SOS> `` well , then , hearken to me . '' <EOS>	65.40486153833695
<SOS> `` i listen . '' <EOS>	75.97007918504357
<SOS> `` you agree , do you not , that obtaining a carriage is out of the question ? '' <EOS>	84.87012953911068
<SOS> `` i do . '' <EOS>	47.58554639843196
<SOS> `` neither can we procure horses ? '' <EOS>	87.62838000432102
<SOS> `` true ; we have offered any sum , but have failed . '' <EOS>	92.87941339297078
<SOS> `` well , now , what do you say to a cart ? <EOS>	90.21380970767628
<SOS> i dare say such a thing might be had . '' <EOS>	68.61785920931732
<SOS> `` very possibly . '' <EOS>	108.51067326462044
<SOS> `` and a pair of oxen ? '' <EOS>	85.41219355171134
<SOS> `` as easily found as the cart . '' <EOS>	59.16806902599655
<SOS> `` then you see , my good fellow , with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed . <EOS>	71.48962770117352
<SOS> the cart must be tastefully ornamented ; and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers , we may get up a striking tableau , after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert . <EOS>	74.40291365638238
<SOS> it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento . <EOS>	63.40549945589777
<SOS> our group would then be quite complete , more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna . '' <EOS>	83.06576266865459
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz , `` this time , m. albert , i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea . '' <EOS>	84.22599634716065
<SOS> `` and quite a national one , too , '' replied albert with gratified pride . <EOS>	112.25414508905287
<SOS> `` a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities . <EOS>	72.74207101282234
<SOS> ha , ha , ye romans ! <EOS>	54.22803789422422
<SOS> you thought to make us , unhappy strangers , trot at the heels of your processions , like so many lazzaroni , because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city . <EOS>	65.96624710856669
<SOS> but you do n't know us ; when we ca n't have one thing we invent another . '' <EOS>	99.42840933728566
<SOS> `` and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody ? '' <EOS>	55.67589715576725
<SOS> `` only to our host . <EOS>	54.28260008989663
<SOS> upon my return home i sent for him , and i then explained to him what i wished to procure . <EOS>	60.546827932395686
<SOS> he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired . <EOS>	78.20822638115847
<SOS> one thing i was sorry for ; when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded , he told me there would not be time , as it would require three days to do that ; so you see we must do without this little superfluity . '' <EOS>	113.21766292412376
<SOS> `` and where is he now ? '' <EOS>	99.42187946006979
<SOS> `` who ? '' <EOS>	99.24362223345484
<SOS> `` our host . '' <EOS>	42.79782717684149
<SOS> `` gone out in search of our equipage , by tomorrow it might be too late . '' <EOS>	49.38805875529429
<SOS> `` then he will be able to give us an answer tonight . '' <EOS>	77.03544441517371
<SOS> `` oh , i expect him every minute . '' <EOS>	64.13587199310255
<SOS> at this instant the door opened , and the head of signor pastrini appeared. `` <EOS>	90.01493426005473
<SOS> permesso ? '' <EOS>	67.25598566345813
<SOS> inquired he . <EOS>	116.01624692262178
<SOS> `` certainly certainly , '' cried franz . <EOS>	61.768549796360915
<SOS> `` come in , my host . '' <EOS>	58.65956636173262
<SOS> `` now , then , '' asked albert eagerly , `` have you found the desired cart and oxen ? '' <EOS>	67.06056386728125
<SOS> `` better than that ! '' <EOS>	78.29712578803884
<SOS> replied signor pastrini , with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself . <EOS>	57.327849901662425
<SOS> `` take care , my worthy host , '' said albert , `` better is a sure enemy to well . '' <EOS>	111.35620099576025
<SOS> `` let your excellencies only leave the matter to me , '' returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence . <EOS>	76.14596253617509
<SOS> `` but what have you done ? '' <EOS>	70.05315858337802
<SOS> asked franz . <EOS>	57.15392821937604
<SOS> `` speak out , there 's a worthy fellow . '' <EOS>	89.60627352639749
<SOS> `` your excellencies are aware , '' responded the landlord , swelling with importance , `` that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves ! '' <EOS>	46.28474571710817
<SOS> `` i should think we did know it , '' exclaimed albert , `` since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms , like two poor students in the back streets of paris . '' <EOS>	65.45144655018326
<SOS> `` when , then , the count of monte cristo , hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed , has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli . '' <EOS>	59.19784815820925
<SOS> the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise . <EOS>	82.34331441511675
<SOS> `` but do you think , '' asked albert , `` that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger ? '' <EOS>	60.273393033947464
<SOS> `` what sort of person is this count of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	56.06203441086451
<SOS> asked franz of his host . <EOS>	84.41991050920586
<SOS> `` a very great nobleman , but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say ; but this i know , that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine . '' <EOS>	75.02781599976548
<SOS> `` it seems to me , '' said franz , speaking in an undertone to albert , `` that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord , he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel , and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way . <EOS>	101.29431472128356
<SOS> he would have written or `` at this instant someone knocked at the door . <EOS>	65.26065494491499
<SOS> `` come in , '' said franz . <EOS>	66.03725560259595
<SOS> a servant , wearing a livery of considerable style and richness , appeared at the threshold , and , placing two cards in the landlord 's hands , who forthwith presented them to the two young men , he said : `` please to deliver these , from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m. franz d'épinay . <EOS>	84.14585619406644
<SOS> the count of monte cristo , '' continued the servant , `` begs these gentlemen 's permission to wait upon them as their neighbor , and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him . '' <EOS>	64.0003935392395
<SOS> `` faith , franz , '' whispered albert , `` there is not much to find fault with here . '' <EOS>	75.95964645571155
<SOS> `` tell the count , '' replied franz , `` that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him . '' <EOS>	64.98410340882427
<SOS> the servant bowed and retired . <EOS>	61.20920895104968
<SOS> `` that is what i call an elegant mode of attack , '' said albert , `` you were quite correct in what you said , signor pastrini . <EOS>	98.77224918607568
<SOS> the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world . '' <EOS>	86.07419382933853
<SOS> `` then you accept his offer ? '' <EOS>	44.86886754575269
<SOS> said the host . <EOS>	83.538921711164
<SOS> `` of course we do , '' replied albert . <EOS>	79.53037605238072
<SOS> `` still , i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect ! <EOS>	49.15388195049719
<SOS> and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli , by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme , i do n't know but what i should have held on by my original plan . <EOS>	73.16084058865619
<SOS> what say you , franz ? '' <EOS>	60.227537718407525
<SOS> `` oh , i agree with you ; the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me . '' <EOS>	68.65911983811262
<SOS> the truth was , that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin , in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal ; and if this muffled up individual proved ( as franz felt sure he would ) the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina , then he should be able to establish his identity , and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom . <EOS>	72.60519411631992
<SOS> franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor , and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce . <EOS>	84.70656186765963
<SOS> the next day must clear up every doubt ; and unless his near neighbor and would be friend , the count of monte cristo , possessed the ring of gyges , and by its power was able to render himself invisible , it was very certain he could not escape this time . <EOS>	62.36076869786301
<SOS> eight o'clock found franz up and dressed , while albert , who had not the same motives for early rising , was still soundly asleep . <EOS>	69.02964141780852
<SOS> the first act of franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness . <EOS>	54.366225998922225
<SOS> `` pray , signor pastrini , '' asked franz , `` is not some execution appointed to take place today ? '' <EOS>	68.48919487615518
<SOS> `` yes , your excellency ; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from , you are much too late . '' <EOS>	104.22442336263575
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' answered franz , `` i had no such intention ; and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle , i might have done so from monte pincio ; could i not ? '' <EOS>	104.10740500486861
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	56.72076357470253
<SOS> exclaimed mine host , `` i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill , which , indeed , they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves . '' <EOS>	73.7694275321645
<SOS> `` very possibly i may not go , '' answered franz ; `` but in case i feel disposed , give me some particulars of today 's executions . '' <EOS>	77.92308181751116
<SOS> `` what particulars would your excellency like to hear ? '' <EOS>	90.3169701628351
<SOS> `` why , the number of persons condemned to suffer , their names , and description of the death they are to die . '' <EOS>	61.905727216088444
<SOS> `` that happens just lucky , your excellency ! <EOS>	76.2481553978059
<SOS> only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas . '' <EOS>	79.354684875589
<SOS> `` what are they ? '' <EOS>	68.80591465231933
<SOS> `` sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution , on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment . <EOS>	71.9117238798172
<SOS> the reason for so publicly announcing all this is , that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits , and , above all , beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance . '' <EOS>	63.488511110985336
<SOS> `` and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful , are they ? '' <EOS>	68.84632884109705
<SOS> asked franz somewhat incredulously . <EOS>	65.24822674649364
<SOS> `` oh , dear , no , your excellency ! <EOS>	102.09786300177454
<SOS> i have not time for anybody 's affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests ; but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers , and he brings them to me as he would the playbills , that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution , he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc . '' <EOS>	59.55490499950616
<SOS> `` upon my word , that is a most delicate attention on your part , signor pastrini , '' cried franz . <EOS>	104.36741146549402
<SOS> `` why , your excellency , '' returned the landlord , chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency , `` i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel . '' <EOS>	92.5087431966599
<SOS> `` i see that plainly enough , my most excellent host , and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go . <EOS>	82.13224140648364
<SOS> meanwhile , oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas . '' <EOS>	63.40775913603616
<SOS> `` nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency 's wish , '' said the landlord , opening the door of the chamber ; `` i have caused one to be placed on the landing , close by your apartment . '' <EOS>	72.60262120699487
<SOS> then , taking the tablet from the wall , he handed it to franz , who read as follows : `` 'the public is informed that on wednesday , february < num > rd , being the first day of the carnival , executions will take place in the piazza del popolo , by order of the tribunal of the rota , of two persons , named andrea rondolo , and peppino , otherwise called rocca priori ; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest , named don césar torlini , canon of the church of st. john lateran ; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit , luigi vampa , and his band . <EOS>	83.51377221915637
<SOS> the first named malefactor will be mazzolato , the second culprit decapitato . <EOS>	72.59018262665336
<SOS> `` 'the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men , that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt , and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes . ' '' <EOS>	58.19929730249829
<SOS> this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum . <EOS>	47.38884091453761
<SOS> no part of the programme differed , the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment , all agreed with his previous information . <EOS>	71.65085095674218
<SOS> in all probability , therefore , the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself , and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as `` sinbad the sailor , '' but who , no doubt , was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome , as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis . <EOS>	73.94418330064678
<SOS> time was getting on , however , and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert ; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber , his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day . <EOS>	87.49309971614612
<SOS> the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour . <EOS>	57.77377629720597
<SOS> `` now , my excellent signor pastrini , '' said franz , addressing his landlord , `` since we are both ready , do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	82.79056052755917
<SOS> `` most assuredly , '' replied he . <EOS>	59.89512454387247
<SOS> `` the count of monte cristo is always an early riser ; and i can answer for his having been up these two hours . '' <EOS>	68.85058209300092
<SOS> `` then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly ? '' <EOS>	97.61133722342998
<SOS> < num > m `` oh , i am quite sure . <EOS>	79.30401219563507
<SOS> i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error . '' <EOS>	93.13837702707336
<SOS> `` well , then , if it be so , are you ready , albert ? '' <EOS>	76.58066726284729
<SOS> `` perfectly . '' <EOS>	109.35054330274232
<SOS> `` let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy . '' <EOS>	100.41565332272074
<SOS> `` yes , let us do so . '' <EOS>	54.18245482340074
<SOS> the landlord preceded the friends across the landing , which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count , rang at the bell , and , upon the door being opened by a servant , said : `` i signori francesi . '' <EOS>	98.76870586389194
<SOS> the domestic bowed respectfully , and invited them to enter . <EOS>	82.66289396701733
<SOS> they passed through two rooms , furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini , and were shown into an elegantly fitted up drawing room . <EOS>	63.97021794524167
<SOS> the richest turkey carpets covered the floor , and the softest and most inviting couches , easy chairs , and sofas , offered their high piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment . <EOS>	88.98156090343299
<SOS> splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls , intermingled with magnificent trophies of war , while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room . <EOS>	95.2507854688616
<SOS> `` if your excellencies will please to be seated , '' said the man , `` i will let the count know that you are here . '' <EOS>	57.2205954774976
<SOS> and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières . <EOS>	102.72155589771562
<SOS> as the door opened , the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men , but was almost immediately lost , for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter . <EOS>	86.50285614608762
<SOS> franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	100.93104318384034
<SOS> everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey . <EOS>	65.55733452994443
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz to his friend , `` what think you of all this ? '' <EOS>	69.15365525425567
<SOS> `` why , upon my soul , my dear fellow , it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds , or some prince travelling incog . '' <EOS>	81.57157126033867
<SOS> `` hush , hush ! '' <EOS>	75.50265175490745
<SOS> replied franz ; `` we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes ! '' <EOS>	52.849427064741455
<SOS> as franz spoke , he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges , and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside , and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men . <EOS>	53.911888668753264
<SOS> albert instantly rose to meet him , but franz remained , in a manner , spellbound on his chair ; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum , and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina , but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo . <EOS>	87.3101360926216
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	57.32095433704835
<SOS> la mazzolata gentlemen , '' said the count of monte cristo as he entered , `` i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated ; but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments ; besides , you sent me word that you would come to me , and i have held myself at your disposal . '' <EOS>	63.31717456963849
<SOS> `` franz and i have to thank you a thousand times , count , '' returned albert ; `` you extricated us from a great dilemma , and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us . '' <EOS>	81.34455108549666
<SOS> `` indeed , '' returned the count , motioning the two young men to sit down . <EOS>	40.56328184075546
<SOS> `` it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini , that i did not sooner assist you in your distress . <EOS>	74.46223559115437
<SOS> he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me , when he knows that , alone and isolated as i am , i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors . <EOS>	51.321083755313516
<SOS> as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you , i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services . '' <EOS>	49.01019942934518
<SOS> the two young men bowed . <EOS>	89.35383042735012
<SOS> franz had , as yet , found nothing to say ; he had come to no determination , and as nothing in the count 's manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him , he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past , or wait until he had more proof ; besides , although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening , he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum . <EOS>	79.18377515976745
<SOS> he resolved , therefore , to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count . <EOS>	54.25064567279958
<SOS> moreover , he had this advantage , he was master of the count 's secret , while the count had no hold on franz , who had nothing to conceal . <EOS>	56.55342069460812
<SOS> however , he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts . <EOS>	53.45946288186607
<SOS> `` count , '' said he , `` you have offered us places in your carriage , and at your windows in the rospoli palace . <EOS>	92.78159062056812
<SOS> can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ? '' <EOS>	77.22702445439215
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the count negligently , looking attentively at morcerf , `` is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo ? '' <EOS>	67.3937399561419
<SOS> `` yes , '' returned franz , finding that the count was coming to the point he wished . <EOS>	72.75645397451002
<SOS> `` stay , i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this ; perhaps i can render you this slight service also . '' <EOS>	65.57719589109217
<SOS> he extended his hand , and rang the bell thrice . <EOS>	69.5423417066234
<SOS> `` did you ever occupy yourself , '' said he to franz , `` with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants ? <EOS>	69.88874203822284
<SOS> i have . <EOS>	54.08021606932371
<SOS> when i ring once , it is for my valet ; twice , for my majordomo ; thrice , for my steward , thus i do not waste a minute or a word . <EOS>	57.65186042998083
<SOS> here he is . '' <EOS>	73.6715945714008
<SOS> a man of about forty five or fifty entered , exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern ; but he did not appear to recognize him . <EOS>	51.514353648574065
<SOS> it was evident he had his orders . <EOS>	85.90225953968951
<SOS> `` monsieur bertuccio , '' said the count , `` you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo , as i ordered you yesterday . '' <EOS>	61.36464345828298
<SOS> `` yes , excellency , '' returned the steward ; `` but it was very late . '' <EOS>	53.78814917163783
<SOS> `` did i not tell you i wished for one ? '' <EOS>	61.74812949358361
<SOS> replied the count , frowning . <EOS>	109.28654710006923
<SOS> `` and your excellency has one , which was let to prince lobanieff ; but i was obliged to pay a hundred `` `` that will do that will do , monsieur bertuccio ; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements . <EOS>	84.91237008006705
<SOS> you have the window , that is sufficient . <EOS>	49.418805167124965
<SOS> give orders to the coachman ; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it . '' <EOS>	110.20503794620682
<SOS> the steward bowed , and was about to quit the room . <EOS>	59.947717226367764
<SOS> `` ah ! '' <EOS>	52.03374662785214
<SOS> continued the count , `` be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta , and if he can send us an account of the execution . '' <EOS>	77.24843757030004
<SOS> `` there is no need to do that , '' said franz , taking out his tablets ; `` for i saw the account , and copied it down . '' <EOS>	67.77462295192585
<SOS> `` very well , you can retire , m. bertuccio ; i need you no longer . <EOS>	60.358126156166
<SOS> let us know when breakfast is ready . <EOS>	103.90553348935335
<SOS> these gentlemen , '' added he , turning to the two friends , `` will , i trust , do me the honor to breakfast with me ? '' <EOS>	99.6194932391339
<SOS> `` but , my dear count , '' said albert , `` we shall abuse your kindness . '' <EOS>	85.10024307686798
<SOS> `` not at all ; on the contrary , you will give me great pleasure . <EOS>	54.93578915193463
<SOS> you will , one or other of you , perhaps both , return it to me at paris . <EOS>	67.55936107505404
<SOS> m. bertuccio , lay covers for three . '' <EOS>	88.29860071281021
<SOS> he then took franz 's tablets out of his hand . <EOS>	78.36066264074078
<SOS> `` 'we announce , ' he read , in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper , 'that today , the < num > rd of february , will be executed andrea rondolo , guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini , canon of the church of st. john lateran , and peppino , called rocca priori , convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa , and the men of his band . ' <EOS>	68.69101570914184
<SOS> `` hum ! <EOS>	87.1782961092381
<SOS> 'the first will be mazzolato , the second decapitato . ' <EOS>	84.83926421592649
<SOS> yes , '' continued the count , `` it was at first arranged in this way ; but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony . '' <EOS>	84.89814084841494
<SOS> `` really ? '' <EOS>	42.44130710183811
<SOS> said franz . <EOS>	74.59250058323285
<SOS> `` yes , i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi 's , and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men . '' <EOS>	74.66022460000984
<SOS> `` for andrea rondolo ? '' <EOS>	67.69785174569279
<SOS> asked franz . <EOS>	44.978935346780254
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the count , carelessly ; `` for the other ( he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name ) , for peppino , called rocca priori . <EOS>	42.75758178396272
<SOS> you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined ; but the mazzolata still remains , which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time , and even the second , while the other , as you must know , is very simple . <EOS>	84.8814206556975
<SOS> the mandaïa < num > never fails , never trembles , never strikes thirty times ineffectually , like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais , and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer . <EOS>	55.935778647941284
<SOS> ah , '' added the count , in a contemptuous tone , `` do not tell me of european punishments , they are in the infancy , or rather the old age , of cruelty . '' <EOS>	94.93543430343233
<SOS> `` really , count , '' replied franz , `` one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world . '' <EOS>	50.296279274889315
<SOS> `` there are , at least , few that i have not seen , '' said the count coldly . <EOS>	66.41260233560978
<SOS> `` and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles ? '' <EOS>	88.8397658213147
<SOS> `` my first sentiment was horror , the second indifference , the third curiosity . '' <EOS>	67.03321833858122
<SOS> `` curiosity that is a terrible word . '' <EOS>	103.30077374817348
<SOS> `` why so ? <EOS>	77.67860561921725
<SOS> in life , our greatest preoccupation is death ; is it not then , curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part ; and how , according to their different characters , temperaments , and even the different customs of their countries , different persons bear the transition from life to death , from existence to annihilation ? <EOS>	48.45485688209926
<SOS> as for myself , i can assure you of one thing , the more men you see die , the easier it becomes to die yourself ; and in my opinion , death may be a torture , but it is not an expiation . '' <EOS>	88.16027228924514
<SOS> `` i do not quite understand you , '' replied franz ; `` pray explain your meaning , for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch . '' <EOS>	59.839972985779106
<SOS> `` listen , '' said the count , and deep hatred mounted to his face , as the blood would to the face of any other . <EOS>	64.47051701030375
<SOS> `` if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father , your mother , your betrothed , a being who , when torn from you , left a desolation , a wound that never closes , in your breast , do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer , and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain ? '' <EOS>	63.48744892861751
<SOS> `` yes , i know , '' said franz , `` that human justice is insufficient to console us ; she can give blood in return for blood , that is all ; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant . '' <EOS>	69.72956522078606
<SOS> `` i will put another case to you , '' continued the count ; `` that where society , attacked by the death of a person , avenges death by death . <EOS>	77.87727102360103
<SOS> but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them , or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance , of which we have just spoken ? <EOS>	70.95104821691936
<SOS> are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks , the augers of the persians , the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians , are inadequate tortures , and which are unpunished by society ? <EOS>	76.34566614824645
<SOS> answer me , do not these crimes exist ? '' <EOS>	93.3386069480799
<SOS> `` yes , '' answered franz ; `` and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated . '' <EOS>	73.32538019353598
<SOS> `` ah , duelling , '' cried the count ; `` a pleasant manner , upon my soul , of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance ! <EOS>	52.791990917495504
<SOS> a man has carried off your mistress , a man has seduced your wife , a man has dishonored your daughter ; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures , an existence of misery and infamy ; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head , or pass a sword through the breast , of that man who has planted madness in your brain , and despair in your heart . <EOS>	73.33161674567103
<SOS> and remember , moreover , that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife , absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world . <EOS>	105.37535889911481
<SOS> no , no , '' continued the count , `` had i to avenge myself , it is not thus i would take revenge . '' <EOS>	55.17770726779463
<SOS> `` then you disapprove of duelling ? <EOS>	65.89254209366622
<SOS> you would not fight a duel ? '' <EOS>	99.57033063150782
<SOS> asked albert in his turn , astonished at this strange theory . <EOS>	49.8929333354359
<SOS> `` oh , yes , '' replied the count ; `` understand me , i would fight a duel for a trifle , for an insult , for a blow ; and the more so that , thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises , and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired , i should be almost certain to kill my man . <EOS>	64.12649746204697
<SOS> oh , i would fight for such a cause ; but in return for a slow , profound , eternal torture , i would give back the same , were it possible ; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , as the orientalists say , our masters in everything , those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities . '' <EOS>	74.72817260697637
<SOS> `` but , '' said franz to the count , `` with this theory , which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause , it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law . <EOS>	67.32236452860178
<SOS> hatred is blind , rage carries you away ; and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught . '' <EOS>	77.34714987206077
<SOS> `` yes , if he be poor and inexperienced , not if he be rich and skilful ; besides , the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken , and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel . <EOS>	68.12449972019756
<SOS> what matters this punishment , as long as he is avenged ? <EOS>	85.36394804988927
<SOS> on my word , i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded , as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts , and whether it is worth even mentioning ; but , really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival , gentlemen ; how did it arise ? <EOS>	69.31135314749005
<SOS> ah , i recollect , you asked for a place at my window ; you shall have it ; but let us first sit down to table , for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready . '' <EOS>	65.03988442997263
<SOS> as he spoke , a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment , saying : `` al suo commodo ! `` <EOS>	85.65557793220947
<SOS> the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room . <EOS>	97.29586164064354
<SOS> during the meal , which was excellent , and admirably served , franz looked repeatedly at albert , in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer ; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him , whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him , or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone , he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them , but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is , the worst in the world . <EOS>	92.96148735786834
<SOS> as for the count , he just touched the dishes ; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests , and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food . <EOS>	56.852914425425176
<SOS> this brought back to franz , in spite of himself , the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g , and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire . <EOS>	52.51235421988267
<SOS> at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch . <EOS>	59.727283767110094
<SOS> `` well , '' said the count , `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	120.21862033953926
<SOS> `` you must excuse us , count , '' returned franz , `` but we have still much to do . '' <EOS>	73.02970871620713
<SOS> `` what may that be ? '' <EOS>	52.720720094520004
<SOS> `` we have no masks , and it is absolutely necessary to procure them . '' <EOS>	86.72128579445788

<SOS> `` after the execution ? '' <EOS>	57.49777843078867
<SOS> cried franz . <EOS>	56.620915754304846
<SOS> `` before or after , whichever you please . '' <EOS>	79.70835408450272
<SOS> `` opposite the scaffold ? '' <EOS>	55.190212556034766
<SOS> `` the scaffold forms part of the fête . '' <EOS>	48.22221358715024
<SOS> `` count , i have reflected on the matter , '' said franz , `` i thank you for your courtesy , but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace , and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo . '' <EOS>	53.72756972754748
<SOS> `` but i warn you , you will lose a very curious sight , '' returned the count . <EOS>	57.98843692978566
<SOS> `` you will describe it to me , '' replied franz , `` and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it . <EOS>	64.07661945033759
<SOS> i have more than once intended witnessing an execution , but i have never been able to make up my mind ; and you , albert ? '' <EOS>	45.77399904984325
<SOS> `` i , '' replied the viscount , `` i saw castaing executed , but i think i was rather intoxicated that day , for i had quitted college the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern . '' <EOS>	77.51601546946844
<SOS> `` besides , it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris , that you should not see one anywhere else ; when you travel , it is to see everything . <EOS>	75.55461271260037
<SOS> think what a figure you will make when you are asked , 'how do they execute at rome ? ' <EOS>	77.02511129693674
<SOS> and you reply , ' i do not know ! ' <EOS>	71.31231081128787
<SOS> and , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son . <EOS>	111.97103521866751
<SOS> diable ! <EOS>	76.33537853456637
<SOS> when a churchman is killed , it should be with a different weapon than a log , especially when he has behaved like a father . <EOS>	42.391392767794876
<SOS> if you went to spain , would you not see the bull fights ? <EOS>	51.95324591892661
<SOS> well , suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see ? <EOS>	67.6998507351933
<SOS> recollect the ancient romans of the circus , and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men . <EOS>	78.94099703352357
<SOS> think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators , the sage matrons who took their daughters , and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said , 'come , despatch the dying . ' '' <EOS>	86.56950294021814
<SOS> `` shall you go , then , albert ? '' <EOS>	68.93273128970047
<SOS> asked franz. `` <EOS>	72.61248816331491
<SOS> ma foi , yes ; like you , i hesitated , but the count 's eloquence decides me . '' <EOS>	88.65737172341858
<SOS> `` let us go , then , '' said franz , `` since you wish it ; but on our way to the piazza del popolo , i wish to pass through the corso . <EOS>	53.66772727519436

<SOS> `` on foot , yes , in a carriage , no . '' <EOS>	68.28865857505588

<SOS> `` is it important that you should go that way ? '' <EOS>	87.8489717201946
<SOS> `` yes , there is something i wish to see . '' <EOS>	93.56686122551541
<SOS> `` well , we will go by the corso . <EOS>	96.84810762333137

<SOS> `` excellency , '' said a servant , opening the door , `` a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you . '' <EOS>	58.84078211596768
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	90.88093790455821
<SOS> yes , '' returned the count , `` i know who he is , gentlemen ; will you return to the salon ? <EOS>	75.72101810017189
<SOS> you will find good cigars on the centre table . <EOS>	53.30633868331725
<SOS> i will be with you directly . '' <EOS>	56.10576875875466
<SOS> the young men rose and returned into the salon , while the count , again apologizing , left by another door . <EOS>	87.77895342763752
<SOS> albert , who was a great smoker , and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris , approached the table , and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros . <EOS>	101.08461498465152
<SOS> `` well , '' asked franz , `` what think you of the count of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	75.3648258801754
<SOS> `` what do i think ? '' <EOS>	119.74487555517759
<SOS> said albert , evidently surprised at such a question from his companion ; `` i think he is a delightful fellow , who does the honors of his table admirably ; who has travelled much , read much , is , like brutus , of the stoic school , and moreover , '' added he , sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling , `` that he has excellent cigars . '' <EOS>	69.2695038356571
<SOS> such was albert 's opinion of the count , and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection , he made no attempt to change it . <EOS>	114.75872585372835
<SOS> `` but , '' said he , `` did you observe one very singular thing ? '' <EOS>	86.37298957055368
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	49.605752844739314
<SOS> `` how attentively he looked at you . '' <EOS>	70.56315852313901
<SOS> `` at me ? '' <EOS>	67.2320129644828
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	72.88723008140963
<SOS> albert reflected . <EOS>	75.39771970790083
<SOS> `` ah , '' replied he , sighing , `` that is not very surprising ; i have been more than a year absent from paris , and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut ; the count takes me for a provincial . <EOS>	61.90207863439626
<SOS> the first opportunity you have , undeceive him , i beg , and tell him i am nothing of the kind . '' <EOS>	98.28500811126361
<SOS> franz smiled ; an instant after the count entered . <EOS>	108.33063886232935
<SOS> `` i am now quite at your service , gentlemen , '' said he . <EOS>	84.10131945876691
<SOS> `` the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo , and we will go another ; and , if you please , by the corso . <EOS>	91.92891048553977
<SOS> take some more of these cigars , m. de morcerf . '' <EOS>	76.23807443323246
<SOS> `` with all my heart , '' returned albert ; `` italian cigars are horrible . <EOS>	78.90780727936195
<SOS> when you come to paris , i will return all this . '' <EOS>	113.10480729263638
<SOS> `` i will not refuse ; i intend going there soon , and since you allow me , i will pay you a visit . <EOS>	49.38217304558877
<SOS> come , we have not any time to lose , it is half past twelve let us set off . '' <EOS>	80.2306458110007
<SOS> all three descended ; the coachman received his master 's orders , and drove down the via del babuino . <EOS>	102.04872900633855
<SOS> while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina , which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces , franz 's attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace , for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant . <EOS>	79.3719232835195
<SOS> `` which are your windows ? '' <EOS>	67.72344784921461
<SOS> asked he of the count , with as much indifference as he could assume . <EOS>	75.32678096183291
<SOS> `` the three last , '' returned he , with a negligence evidently unaffected , for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put . <EOS>	65.27254884782757
<SOS> franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows . <EOS>	75.61622985307501
<SOS> the side windows were hung with yellow damask , and the centre one with white damask and a red cross . <EOS>	76.28695526452265
<SOS> the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin , and there could now be no doubt that he was the count . <EOS>	97.9481797554238
<SOS> the three windows were still untenanted . <EOS>	63.051893559642394
<SOS> preparations were making on every side ; chairs were placed , scaffolds were raised , and windows were hung with flags . <EOS>	83.99236946106701
<SOS> the masks could not appear ; the carriages could not move about ; but the masks were visible behind the windows , the carriages , and the doors . <EOS>	107.99432459274001
<SOS> franz , albert , and the count continued to descend the corso . <EOS>	61.132820942021
<SOS> as they approached the piazza del popolo , the crowd became more dense , and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible : the obelisk , surmounted by a cross , which marks the centre of the square , and in front of the obelisk , at the point where the three streets , del babuino , del corso , and di ripetta , meet , the two uprights of the scaffold , between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaïa . <EOS>	69.07861053009647
<SOS> at the corner of the street they met the count 's steward , who was awaiting his master . <EOS>	72.51757137203124
<SOS> the window , let at an exorbitant price , which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests , was on the second floor of the great palace , situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio . <EOS>	99.6290839298027
<SOS> it consisted , as we have said , of a small dressing room , opening into a bedroom , and , when the door of communication was shut , the inmates were quite alone . <EOS>	70.74163744503613
<SOS> on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin . <EOS>	48.7968542489882
<SOS> < num > m `` as you left the choice of your costumes to me , '' said the count to the two friends , `` i have had these brought , as they will be the most worn this year ; and they are most suitable , on account of the confetti ( sweetmeats ) , as they do not show the flour . '' <EOS>	58.86005845971614
<SOS> franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly , and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes ; for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented , and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre . <EOS>	88.37138387847689
<SOS> it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine , we say guillotine , because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument. < num > the knife , which is shaped like a crescent , that cuts with the convex side , falls from a less height , and that is all the difference . <EOS>	77.69612738022268
<SOS> two men , seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid , were eating their breakfasts , while waiting for the criminal . <EOS>	94.40673178051138
<SOS> their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages . <EOS>	65.2870756681947
<SOS> one of them lifted the plank , took out a flask of wine , drank some , and then passed it to his companion . <EOS>	84.29037128929004
<SOS> these two men were the executioner 's assistants . <EOS>	44.222959112707656
<SOS> at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow . <EOS>	57.849091887610776
<SOS> the prisoners , transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo , had passed the night , each accompanied by two priests , in a chapel closed by a grating , before which were two sentinels , who were relieved at intervals . <EOS>	65.49813487467425
<SOS> a double line of carbineers , placed on each side of the door of the church , reached to the scaffold , and formed a circle around it , leaving a path about ten feet wide , and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet . <EOS>	71.54726429576975
<SOS> all the rest of the square was paved with heads . <EOS>	72.16588478418308
<SOS> many women held their infants on their shoulders , and thus the children had the best view . <EOS>	75.58293307157854
<SOS> the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators ; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed ; the steps even seemed a parti colored sea , that was impelled towards the portico ; every niche in the wall held its living statue . <EOS>	110.89697647769952
<SOS> what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death . <EOS>	111.5416848357723
<SOS> and yet , instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion , laughter and jests arose from the crowd . <EOS>	91.45436089400897
<SOS> it was evident that the execution was , in the eyes of the people , only the commencement of the carnival . <EOS>	68.42948388170882
<SOS> suddenly the tumult ceased , as if by magic , and the doors of the church opened . <EOS>	81.87359077769169
<SOS> a brotherhood of penitents , clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth , with holes for the eyes , and holding in their hands lighted tapers , appeared first ; the chief marched at the head . <EOS>	67.27278706182913
<SOS> < num > m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions . <EOS>	75.94489482438487
<SOS> he was naked , with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath , and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer . <EOS>	48.02081511629405
<SOS> this man was the executioner . <EOS>	52.49496284930269
<SOS> he had , moreover , sandals bound on his feet by cords . <EOS>	70.80215849426567
<SOS> behind the executioner came , in the order in which they were to die , first peppino and then andrea . <EOS>	103.21696852633194
<SOS> each was accompanied by two priests . <EOS>	114.43095393363959
<SOS> neither had his eyes bandaged . <EOS>	88.6381608507054
<SOS> peppino walked with a firm step , doubtless aware of what awaited him . <EOS>	79.65370267217006
<SOS> andrea was supported by two priests . <EOS>	56.24069426746681
<SOS> each of them , from time to time , kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them . <EOS>	74.3143527735173
<SOS> at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him . <EOS>	65.5480968262271
<SOS> he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt , and mechanically cast away his cigar , although he had not half smoked it . <EOS>	88.0343087623887
<SOS> the count alone seemed unmoved nay , more , a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks . <EOS>	74.53526146443843
<SOS> his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey , and his lips , half opened , disclosed his white teeth , small and sharp like those of a jackal . <EOS>	74.3978317315023
<SOS> and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness , such as franz had never before witnessed in them ; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity . <EOS>	56.357251434515284
<SOS> however , the two culprits advanced , and as they approached their faces became visible . <EOS>	46.32670244247562
<SOS> peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty , bronzed by the sun ; he carried his head erect , and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear . <EOS>	94.45995283756048
<SOS> andrea was short and fat ; his visage , marked with brutal cruelty , did not indicate age ; he might be thirty . <EOS>	91.98416891993584
<SOS> in prison he had suffered his beard to grow ; his head fell on his shoulder , his legs bent beneath him , and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious . <EOS>	83.68633745903013
<SOS> `` i thought , '' said franz to the count , `` that you told me there would be but one execution . '' <EOS>	99.85894756093
<SOS> `` i told you true , '' replied he coldly . <EOS>	68.68458943681927
<SOS> `` and yet here are two culprits . '' <EOS>	40.9635962630836
<SOS> `` yes ; but only one of these two is about to die ; the other has many years to live . '' <EOS>	68.15074751106746
<SOS> `` if the pardon is to come , there is no time to lose . '' <EOS>	73.62276220131874
<SOS> `` and see , here it is , '' said the count . <EOS>	57.54947632689317
<SOS> at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaïa , a priest arrived in some haste , forced his way through the soldiers , and , advancing to the chief of the brotherhood , gave him a folded paper . <EOS>	58.43066098192969
<SOS> the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all . <EOS>	61.08733581764704
<SOS> the chief took the paper , unfolded it , and , raising his hand , `` heaven be praised , and his holiness also , '' said he in a loud voice ; `` here is a pardon for one of the prisoners ! '' <EOS>	100.27895195955995
<SOS> `` a pardon ! '' <EOS>	52.228436566960504
<SOS> cried the people with one voice ; `` a pardon ! '' <EOS>	49.16313140386298
<SOS> at this cry andrea raised his head . <EOS>	64.11182168503174
<SOS> `` pardon for whom ? '' <EOS>	94.94927354757873
<SOS> cried he . <EOS>	79.80023197019517
<SOS> peppino remained breathless . <EOS>	72.58061989232355
<SOS> `` a pardon for peppino , called rocca priori , '' said the principal friar . <EOS>	66.40003287772855
<SOS> and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers , who read and returned it to him . <EOS>	73.8055653662555
<SOS> `` for peppino ! '' <EOS>	101.73939293204916
<SOS> cried andrea , who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged . <EOS>	121.04412491509213
<SOS> `` why for him and not for me ? <EOS>	63.25238110703533
<SOS> we ought to die together . <EOS>	62.007623546659566
<SOS> i was promised he should die with me . <EOS>	71.10051276957498
<SOS> you have no right to put me to death alone . <EOS>	77.61790134187486
<SOS> i will not die alone i will not ! '' <EOS>	81.92681883917156
<SOS> and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast , and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands . <EOS>	77.96009038148298
<SOS> the executioner made a sign , and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him . <EOS>	83.67848925070737
<SOS> `` what is going on ? '' <EOS>	110.51909910505783
<SOS> asked franz of the count ; for , as all the talk was in the roman dialect , he had not perfectly understood it . <EOS>	80.15649637405015
<SOS> `` do you not see ? '' <EOS>	57.64405121928041
<SOS> returned the count , `` that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him ? <EOS>	56.078186527555204
<SOS> and , were he able , he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of . <EOS>	70.61883341357847
<SOS> oh , man , man race of crocodiles , '' cried the count , extending his clenched hands towards the crowd , `` how well do i recognize you there , and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves ! '' <EOS>	109.11622701088672
<SOS> meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground , and he kept exclaiming , `` he ought to die ! <EOS>	45.52176132255794
<SOS> he shall die ! <EOS>	65.01298271453344
<SOS> i will not die alone ! '' <EOS>	92.13339094726994
<SOS> `` look , look , '' cried the count , seizing the young men 's hands ; `` look , for on my soul it is curious . <EOS>	77.28296434663355
<SOS> here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate , who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward , it is true , but he was about to die without resistance . <EOS>	62.836668576412585
<SOS> do you know what gave him strength ? <EOS>	100.94552236399852
<SOS> do you know what consoled him ? <EOS>	46.679158641488165
<SOS> it was , that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him ! <EOS>	49.60411638821566
<SOS> lead two sheep to the butcher 's , two oxen to the slaughterhouse , and make one of them understand that his companion will not die ; the sheep will bleat for pleasure , the ox will bellow with joy . <EOS>	67.65058958265514
<SOS> but man man , whom god created in his own image man , upon whom god has laid his first , his sole commandment , to love his neighbor man , to whom god has given a voice to express his thoughts what is his first cry when he hears his fellow man is saved ? <EOS>	74.19316937190274
<SOS> a blasphemy . <EOS>	72.12344067792293
<SOS> honor to man , this masterpiece of nature , this king of the creation ! '' <EOS>	86.54182635833048
<SOS> and the count burst into a laugh ; a terrible laugh , that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh . <EOS>	82.403686054324
<SOS> however , the struggle still continued , and it was dreadful to witness . <EOS>	89.8649233935747
<SOS> the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold ; the people all took part against andrea , and twenty thousand voices cried , `` put him to death ! <EOS>	51.33072306589028
<SOS> put him to death ! '' <EOS>	55.89527800351201
<SOS> franz sprang back , but the count seized his arm , and held him before the window . <EOS>	63.85084284834415
<SOS> `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	62.591915981885286
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	61.47117595547974

<SOS> no , no look , look ! '' <EOS>	78.84914733509196

<SOS> franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle . <EOS>	115.97321029665285
<SOS> the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold , and there , in spite of his struggles , his bites , and his cries , had forced him to his knees . <EOS>	110.5534905298877
<SOS> during this time the executioner had raised his mace , and signed to them to get out of the way ; the criminal strove to rise , but , ere he had time , the mace fell on his left temple . <EOS>	42.71378962620632
<SOS> a dull and heavy sound was heard , and the man dropped like an ox on his face , and then turned over on his back . <EOS>	55.32043559247811
<SOS> the executioner let fall his mace , drew his knife , and with one stroke opened his throat , and mounting on his stomach , stamped violently on it with his feet . <EOS>	68.75148261792856
<SOS> at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound . <EOS>	61.00157634093471
<SOS> this time franz could contain himself no longer , but sank , half fainting , into a seat . <EOS>	42.66289834972202
<SOS> albert , with his eyes closed , was standing grasping the window curtains . <EOS>	70.29070751694672
<SOS> the count was erect and triumphant , like the avenging angel ! <EOS>	91.25947862641533
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	89.63970922302565
<SOS> the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses , he saw albert drinking a glass of water , of which , to judge from his pallor , he stood in great need ; and the count , who was assuming his masquerade costume . <EOS>	65.6009096143998
<SOS> he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed ; scaffold , executioners , victims , all had disappeared ; only the people remained , full of noise and excitement . <EOS>	84.42225672791305
<SOS> the bell of monte citorio , which only sounds on the pope 's decease and the opening of the carnival , was ringing a joyous peal . <EOS>	96.28145135412923
<SOS> `` well , '' asked he of the count , `` what has , then , happened ? '' <EOS>	66.30394046524043
<SOS> `` nothing , '' replied the count ; `` only , as you see , the carnival has commenced . <EOS>	72.02575114499386
<SOS> make haste and dress yourself . '' <EOS>	66.99630715702082
<SOS> `` in fact , '' said franz , `` this horrible scene has passed away like a dream . '' <EOS>	48.72797571210405
<SOS> `` it is but a dream , a nightmare , that has disturbed you . '' <EOS>	86.6860201846833
<SOS> `` yes , that i have suffered ; but the culprit ? '' <EOS>	48.72995163188303
<SOS> `` that is a dream also ; only he has remained asleep , while you have awakened ; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate ? '' <EOS>	95.31858425497944
<SOS> `` but peppino what has become of him ? '' <EOS>	62.69390484512436
<SOS> `` peppino is a lad of sense , who , unlike most men , who are happy in proportion as they are noticed , was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion . <EOS>	81.09863807941755
<SOS> he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd , without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him . <EOS>	82.68643556339913
<SOS> decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal . <EOS>	96.13798292594585
<SOS> but dress yourself ; see , m. de morcerf sets you the example . '' <EOS>	77.64174226492513
<SOS> albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots . <EOS>	73.15443722630255
<SOS> `` well , albert , '' said franz , `` do you feel much inclined to join the revels ? <EOS>	81.21865884033664
<SOS> come , answer frankly . '' <EOS>	112.87109608000218
<SOS> `` ma foi , no , '' returned albert . <EOS>	96.53579546890579
<SOS> `` but i am really glad to have seen such a sight ; and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle , it is the only one that causes you any emotion . '' <EOS>	76.60054910621994
<SOS> < num > m `` without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character , '' said the count ; `` on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life , and the real visage is disclosed . <EOS>	96.89841433222874
<SOS> it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome , the hideous scoundrel ! <EOS>	69.79153755162231
<SOS> come , dress yourselves , gentlemen , dress yourselves . '' <EOS>	75.95142917135799
<SOS> franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions ' example . <EOS>	56.49843076779251
<SOS> he assumed his costume , and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face . <EOS>	50.41427211715615
<SOS> their toilet finished , they descended ; the carriage awaited them at the door , filled with sweetmeats and bouquets . <EOS>	93.01828792794029
<SOS> they fell into the line of carriages . <EOS>	62.8304206897467
<SOS> it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place . <EOS>	95.27826791479418
<SOS> instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death , the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry . <EOS>	84.40602780184155
<SOS> a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides , emerging from the doors , descending from the windows . <EOS>	66.33456502594174
<SOS> from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns , harlequins , dominoes , mummers , pantomimists , transteverins , knights , and peasants , screaming , fighting , gesticulating , throwing eggs filled with flour , confetti , nosegays , attacking , with their sarcasms and their missiles , friends and foes , companions and strangers , indiscriminately , and no one took offence , or did anything but laugh . <EOS>	67.28869728438202
<SOS> franz and albert were like men who , to drive away a violent sorrow , have recourse to wine , and who , as they drink and become intoxicated , feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present . <EOS>	96.63309466226568
<SOS> they saw , or rather continued to see , the image of what they had witnessed ; but little by little the general vertigo seized them , and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion . <EOS>	102.10455829097543
<SOS> a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage , and which , while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust , pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins , incited him to join in the general combat , in which all the masks around him were engaged . <EOS>	48.84669960555159
<SOS> he rose in his turn , and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats , with which the carriage was filled , cast them with all the force and skill he was master of . <EOS>	95.98232202887729
<SOS> < num > m the strife had fairly begun , and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men 's minds , so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld . <EOS>	67.53757373091275
<SOS> as for the count of monte cristo , he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved . <EOS>	88.12957119598914
<SOS> imagine the large and splendid corso , bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces , with their balconies hung with carpets , and their windows with flags . <EOS>	62.09246392900083
<SOS> at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans , italians , strangers from all parts of the world , the united aristocracy of birth , wealth , and genius . <EOS>	75.09022363159158
<SOS> lovely women , yielding to the influence of the scene , bend over their balconies , or lean from their windows , and shower down confetti , which are returned by bouquets ; the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers . <EOS>	94.52206143108334
<SOS> in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about , buffaloes ' heads bellow from men 's shoulders , dogs walk on their hind legs ; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted , and , as in callot 's temptation of st. anthony , a lovely face is exhibited , which we would fain follow , but from which we are separated by troops of fiends . <EOS>	79.78394895025173
<SOS> this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome . <EOS>	52.59202187150094
<SOS> at the second turn , the count stopped the carriage , and requested permission to withdraw , leaving the vehicle at their disposal . <EOS>	51.93047812582369
<SOS> franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace . <EOS>	82.46294128242228
<SOS> at the centre window , the one hung with white damask with a red cross , was a blue domino , beneath which franz 's imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina . <EOS>	95.58434787480388
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the count , springing out , `` when you are tired of being actors , and wish to become spectators of this scene , you know you have places at my windows . <EOS>	102.36612859440329
<SOS> in the meantime , dispose of my coachman , my carriage , and my servants . '' <EOS>	63.36463253943929
<SOS> we have forgotten to mention , that the count 's coachman was attired in a bear skin , exactly resembling odry 's in the bear and the pasha ; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys , with spring masks , with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed . <EOS>	80.21221659435727
<SOS> franz thanked the count for his attention . <EOS>	52.86991397319482
<SOS> as for albert , he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him . <EOS>	52.640552356169984
<SOS> unfortunately for him , the line of carriages moved on again , and while he descended the piazza del popolo , the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia . <EOS>	73.43240244518046
<SOS> `` ah , my dear fellow , '' said he to franz ; `` you did not see ? '' <EOS>	95.10943911383468
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	94.65587076295398
<SOS> `` there , that calash filled with roman peasants . '' <EOS>	95.84248943256507
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	51.56374573737362
<SOS> `` well , i am convinced they are all charming women . '' <EOS>	66.16984801931994
<SOS> `` how unfortunate that you were masked , albert , '' said franz ; `` here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments . '' <EOS>	100.77116850944856
<SOS> `` oh , '' replied he , half laughing , half serious ; `` i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other . '' <EOS>	75.48568794768369
<SOS> but , in spite of albert 's hope , the day passed unmarked by any incident , excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants . <EOS>	60.56572910922824
<SOS> at one of these encounters , accidentally or purposely , albert 's mask fell off . <EOS>	68.50877344958451
<SOS> he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage . <EOS>	53.761953121990544
<SOS> doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry ; for , as the carriage of the two friends passed her , she threw a bunch of violets . <EOS>	50.90107976195012
<SOS> albert seized it , and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him , he suffered albert to retain it . <EOS>	74.72150492678965
<SOS> albert placed it in his button hole , and the carriage went triumphantly on . <EOS>	60.34496207571894
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz to him ; `` there is the beginning of an adventure . '' <EOS>	61.12360869381872
<SOS> `` laugh if you please i really think so . <EOS>	95.27561450476804
<SOS> so i will not abandon this bouquet . '' <EOS>	63.66140754308403
<SOS> `` pardieu , '' returned franz , laughing , `` in token of your ingratitude . '' <EOS>	55.60491087891974
<SOS> the jest , however , soon appeared to become earnest ; for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini , the one who had thrown the violets to albert , clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole . <EOS>	81.92609297453177
<SOS> `` bravo , bravo , '' said franz ; `` things go wonderfully . <EOS>	68.05391997638837
<SOS> shall i leave you ? <EOS>	81.85900603117265
<SOS> perhaps you would prefer being alone ? '' <EOS>	48.49912224671912
<SOS> `` no , '' replied he ; `` i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock , as they say at the opera balls . <EOS>	106.43365002673592
<SOS> if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further , we shall find her , or rather , she will find us tomorrow ; then she will give me some sign or other , and i shall know what i have to do . '' <EOS>	92.15784368087382
<SOS> `` on my word , '' said franz , `` you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses , and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind . '' <EOS>	62.95774035711945
<SOS> albert was right ; the fair unknown had resolved , doubtless , to carry the intrigue no farther ; for although the young men made several more turns , they did not again see the calash , which had turned up one of the neighboring streets . <EOS>	55.13038785285054
<SOS> then they returned to the rospoli palace ; but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared ; the two windows , hung with yellow damask , were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited . <EOS>	84.85152943028515
<SOS> at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat . <EOS>	69.40621788284895
<SOS> the file on the corso broke the line , and in a second all the carriages had disappeared . <EOS>	53.406478042980616
<SOS> franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte ; the coachman , without saying a word , drove up it , passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel . <EOS>	73.52331223827869
<SOS> signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests . <EOS>	76.18496736304004
<SOS> franz hastened to inquire after the count , and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time ; but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself , and that it had gone at four o'clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace . <EOS>	53.905141182121255
<SOS> the count had , moreover , charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina . <EOS>	105.41089613564185
<SOS> franz questioned albert as to his intentions ; but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre ; and instead of making any answer , he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor . <EOS>	89.88333879913829
<SOS> `` a tailor , '' said the host ; `` and for what ? '' <EOS>	75.25878259937811
<SOS> `` to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes , '' returned albert . <EOS>	98.33315106296189
<SOS> the host shook his head . <EOS>	40.441955271287334
<SOS> `` to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow ? <EOS>	108.99993573501307
<SOS> i ask your excellencies ' pardon , but this is quite a french demand ; for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button . '' <EOS>	79.41201089867434
<SOS> `` then i must give up the idea ? '' <EOS>	113.06507389042858
<SOS> `` no ; we have them ready made . <EOS>	74.61958630874493
<SOS> leave all to me ; and tomorrow , when you awake , you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied . '' <EOS>	81.87721922803725
<SOS> `` my dear albert , '' said franz , `` leave all to our host ; he has already proved himself full of resources ; let us dine quietly , and afterwards go and see l'italienne à alger ! <EOS>	69.85804894401004
<SOS> `` agreed , '' returned albert ; `` but remember , signor pastrini , that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for . '' <EOS>	70.22960311023088
<SOS> the host again assured them they might rely on him , and that their wishes should be attended to ; upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments , and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes . <EOS>	56.965153756984115
<SOS> albert , as he took off his dress , carefully preserved the bunch of violets ; it was his token reserved for the morrow . <EOS>	89.71437037849613
<SOS> the two friends sat down to table ; but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo 's table and that of signor pastrini . <EOS>	71.0380293511026
<SOS> truth compelled franz , in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count , to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini 's side . <EOS>	110.60976447006966
<SOS> during dessert , the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage . <EOS>	72.96191678263924
<SOS> albert and franz looked at each other , fearing really to abuse the count 's kindness . <EOS>	79.86904935291301
<SOS> the servant understood them . <EOS>	51.43623143982142
<SOS> `` his excellency the count of monte cristo had , '' he said , `` given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships ' orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion . '' <EOS>	73.018626617719
<SOS> they resolved to profit by the count 's courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained . <EOS>	42.67405682093833
<SOS> < num > m this precaution taken , they went to the theatre , and installed themselves in the count 's box . <EOS>	50.209065385319334
<SOS> during the first act , the countess g entered . <EOS>	59.72060611975797
<SOS> her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening , so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz . <EOS>	101.2734521881485
<SOS> her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them , that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity ; and , availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres , who use their boxes to hold receptions , the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess . <EOS>	68.06435377625141
<SOS> scarcely had they entered , when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor . <EOS>	70.96710026323818
<SOS> albert , in his turn , sat behind . <EOS>	41.243196713925556
<SOS> `` well , '' said she , hardly giving franz time to sit down , `` it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven , and you are already the best friends in the world . '' <EOS>	47.083496193526834
<SOS> `` without being so far advanced as that , my dear countess , '' returned franz , `` i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day . '' <EOS>	94.80146020301619
<SOS> `` all day ? '' <EOS>	46.934761761896205
<SOS> `` yes ; this morning we breakfasted with him ; we rode in his carriage all day , and now we have taken possession of his box . '' <EOS>	55.82238965572618

<SOS> `` a tuscan count . '' <EOS>	70.48787780517252

<SOS> `` what sort of a man is he ? '' <EOS>	64.77193036080507

<SOS> `` we should be very hard to please , madam , '' returned albert , `` did we not think him delightful . <EOS>	106.9598889453733

<SOS> `` why , he must be a nabob . <EOS>	91.46219885106741
<SOS> do you know what those three windows were worth ? '' <EOS>	46.48861402661332
<SOS> `` two or three hundred roman crowns ? '' <EOS>	49.14132548179527
<SOS> `` two or three thousand . '' <EOS>	57.13163324968676
<SOS> `` the deuce ! '' <EOS>	71.97411297517299
<SOS> `` does his island produce him such a revenue ? '' <EOS>	92.63517218720825
<SOS> `` it does not bring him a bajocco . '' <EOS>	77.9964649570102
<SOS> `` then why did he purchase it ? '' <EOS>	81.55173440651552
<SOS> `` for a whim . '' <EOS>	86.56649100745584
<SOS> `` he is an original , then ? '' <EOS>	64.29688657798694
<SOS> `` in reality , '' observed albert , `` he seemed to me somewhat eccentric ; were he at paris , and a frequenter of the theatres , i should say he was a poor devil literally mad . <EOS>	76.42001751174374
<SOS> this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony . '' <EOS>	60.89375990310307
<SOS> at this moment a fresh visitor entered , and , according to custom , franz gave up his seat to him . <EOS>	65.63575973965332
<SOS> this circumstance had , moreover , the effect of changing the conversation ; an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel . <EOS>	68.01739480225102
<SOS> signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow ; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied . <EOS>	69.83211404410055
<SOS> the next morning , at nine o'clock , he entered franz 's room , followed by a tailor , who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm ; they selected two exactly alike , and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon , and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days . <EOS>	61.302372671640974
<SOS> albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet , silk stockings with clocks , shoes with buckles , and a silk waistcoat . <EOS>	109.38232438706315
<SOS> this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage ; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist , and when his hat , placed coquettishly on one side , let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons , franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations . <EOS>	57.60472201328779
<SOS> the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes , but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin , and their red caps , which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal ? <EOS>	90.88542645265312
<SOS> franz complimented albert , who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction . <EOS>	106.0293187280731
<SOS> they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered . <EOS>	65.47831212066815
<SOS> < num > m `` gentlemen , '' said he , `` although a companion is agreeable , perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable . <EOS>	83.48732905428028
<SOS> i come to say that today , and for the remainder of the carnival , i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal . <EOS>	54.7299499413694
<SOS> the host will tell you i have three or four more , so that you will not inconvenience me in any way . <EOS>	43.21523077168322
<SOS> make use of it , i pray you , for your pleasure or your business . '' <EOS>	85.01476511224539
<SOS> the young men wished to decline , but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them . <EOS>	79.16706937271624
<SOS> the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them , conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease . <EOS>	84.41928768355973
<SOS> he was , as we have already said , perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries . <EOS>	103.81913802102548
<SOS> a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures . <EOS>	90.7342193450226
<SOS> a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences , and he seemed much occupied with chemistry . <EOS>	94.37835116983615
<SOS> the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them ; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini . <EOS>	84.51957704622293
<SOS> they told him so frankly , and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy . <EOS>	104.82676921796093
<SOS> albert was charmed with the count 's manners , and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge . <EOS>	67.61505687405608
<SOS> the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all , for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening , and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them . <EOS>	111.78828847583091
<SOS> at half past one they descended , the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises , which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever , and which gained them the applause of franz and albert . <EOS>	100.23059559875115
<SOS> albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole . <EOS>	83.3413381562441
<SOS> at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria . <EOS>	65.08241427481691
<SOS> at the second turn , a bunch of fresh violets , thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins , indicated to albert that , like himself and his friend , the peasants had changed their costume also ; and whether it was the result of chance , or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both , while he had donned their costume , they had assumed his . <EOS>	76.64383207599657
<SOS> albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole , but he kept the faded one in his hand ; and when he again met the calash , he raised it to his lips , an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it , but her joyous companions also . <EOS>	86.13167956022629
<SOS> the day was as gay as the preceding one , perhaps even more animated and noisy ; the count appeared for an instant at his window , but when they again passed he had disappeared . <EOS>	90.21890469705953
<SOS> it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day . <EOS>	66.59811246075971
<SOS> in the evening , on his return , franz found a letter from the embassy , informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day . <EOS>	70.29383388258192
<SOS> at each previous visit he had made to rome , he had solicited and obtained the same favor ; and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude , he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st. peter 's successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues . <EOS>	66.32448555992117
<SOS> he did not then think of the carnival , for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness , one can not incline one 's self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi . <EOS>	45.18403439587713
<SOS> on his return from the vatican , franz carefully avoided the corso ; he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts , to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation . <EOS>	81.77757278223812
<SOS> at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed . <EOS>	90.33467899127015
<SOS> the harlequin had reassumed her peasant 's costume , and as she passed she raised her mask . <EOS>	51.205323472483144
<SOS> she was charming . <EOS>	65.91101449110978
<SOS> franz congratulated albert , who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited . <EOS>	109.20614650640653
<SOS> he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs , that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy . <EOS>	112.92610059895397
<SOS> he had made up his mind to write to her the next day . <EOS>	51.25378503903594
<SOS> franz remarked , while he gave these details , that albert seemed to have something to ask of him , but that he was unwilling to ask it . <EOS>	54.78571300112665
<SOS> he insisted upon it , declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished . <EOS>	68.14520493955202
<SOS> albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required , and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day . <EOS>	96.45633671360109
<SOS> albert attributed to franz 's absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask . <EOS>	68.9900271255673
<SOS> franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity . <EOS>	99.62448940641951
<SOS> he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened ; and as , during three years that he had travelled all over italy , a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share , franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion . <EOS>	75.64387911168687
<SOS> he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace . <EOS>	94.75079631803445
<SOS> the next morning he saw albert pass and repass , holding an enormous bouquet , which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle . <EOS>	116.2853565223383
<SOS> this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet ( conspicuous by a circle of white camellias ) in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin . <EOS>	73.22072329965587
<SOS> the evening was no longer joy , but delirium . <EOS>	91.91522047945762
<SOS> albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner . <EOS>	79.5035309662757
<SOS> franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him , and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal . <EOS>	101.5853744979332
<SOS> albert was not deceived , for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner . <EOS>	99.01101190223
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , `` was i mistaken ? '' <EOS>	71.80982720714513
<SOS> `` she has answered you ! '' <EOS>	56.3624842344533
<SOS> cried franz . <EOS>	69.28238144104725
<SOS> `` read . '' <EOS>	60.26797032358421
<SOS> this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe . <EOS>	55.27921611389627
<SOS> franz took the letter , and read : `` tuesday evening , at seven o'clock , descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici , and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you . <EOS>	72.78058584438203
<SOS> when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo , be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume , in order that you may be recognized . <EOS>	68.38905807840264
<SOS> until then you will not see me . <EOS>	65.798394565467
<SOS> constancy and discretion . '' <EOS>	65.01630186558724
<SOS> `` well , '' asked he , when franz had finished , `` what do you think of that ? '' <EOS>	57.160143002176156
<SOS> `` i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance . '' <EOS>	85.92074883451386
<SOS> `` i think so , also , '' replied albert ; `` and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of bracciano 's ball . '' <EOS>	97.92659241257343
<SOS> franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker . <EOS>	48.34698262895299
<SOS> `` take care , albert , '' said franz . <EOS>	72.59711156299385
<SOS> `` all the nobility of rome will be present , and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society , she must go there . '' <EOS>	67.33736304275172
<SOS> `` whether she goes there or not , my opinion is still the same , '' returned albert . <EOS>	69.22875923593573
<SOS> `` you have read the letter ? '' <EOS>	57.579774936214314
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	61.84074350070647
<SOS> `` you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy ? '' <EOS>	85.08163893979707
<SOS> ( this is the name of the lower class . ) <EOS>	87.41404313736817
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	52.652535481735036
<SOS> `` well , read the letter again . <EOS>	55.52687272675985
<SOS> look at the writing , and find if you can , any blemish in the language or orthography . '' <EOS>	88.28815341140744
<SOS> the writing was , in reality , charming , and the orthography irreproachable . <EOS>	77.54932701798987
<SOS> `` you are born to good fortune , '' said franz , as he returned the letter . <EOS>	89.23085757435551
<SOS> `` laugh as much as you will , '' replied albert , `` i am in love . '' <EOS>	93.66276869035042
<SOS> `` you alarm me , '' cried franz . <EOS>	117.79242794591936
<SOS> `` i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano 's , but also return to florence alone . '' <EOS>	80.15358944767982
<SOS> `` if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful , '' said albert , `` i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks , at least . <EOS>	75.61071001448606
<SOS> i adore rome , and i have always had a great taste for archæology . '' <EOS>	55.33403660868747
<SOS> < num > m `` come , two or three more such adventures , and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy . '' <EOS>	50.66541808511811
<SOS> doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready . <EOS>	66.54816005138103
<SOS> albert 's love had not taken away his appetite . <EOS>	88.78515203012961
<SOS> he hastened with franz to seat himself , free to recommence the discussion after dinner . <EOS>	91.69875903966766
<SOS> after dinner , the count of monte cristo was announced . <EOS>	80.03025618654752
<SOS> they had not seen him for two days . <EOS>	86.70179715349988
<SOS> signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia . <EOS>	76.05149692954491
<SOS> he had started the previous evening , and had only returned an hour since . <EOS>	79.13475953594329
<SOS> he was charming . <EOS>	73.1937477876487
<SOS> whether he kept a watch over himself , or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched , he was tonight like everybody else . <EOS>	78.38987090290428
<SOS> the man was an enigma to franz . <EOS>	111.91842554880374
<SOS> the count must feel sure that franz recognized him ; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them . <EOS>	68.24950320663864
<SOS> on his side , however great franz 's desire was to allude to their former interview , the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it . <EOS>	78.93596380313637
<SOS> the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre , and were told they were all let . <EOS>	81.291101381725
<SOS> in consequence , he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit . <EOS>	101.8956279754621
<SOS> franz and albert made some difficulty , alleging their fear of depriving him of it ; but the count replied that , as he was going to the palli theatre , the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it . <EOS>	112.80987543376872
<SOS> this assurance determined the two friends to accept it . <EOS>	90.39050800012255
<SOS> franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count 's pallor , which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting . <EOS>	101.73611854964486
<SOS> he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features , the only defect , or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor . <EOS>	71.14025508225845
<SOS> truly , a byronic hero ! <EOS>	50.81925072407023
<SOS> franz could not , we will not say see him , but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred 's shoulders , or beneath lara 's helmet . <EOS>	66.54298289726057
<SOS> his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts ; he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul , and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed . <EOS>	62.167048156017295
<SOS> the count was no longer young . <EOS>	55.43238543123851
<SOS> he was at least forty ; and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present . <EOS>	86.0947587286558
<SOS> and , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet , the count seemed to have the power of fascination . <EOS>	73.9627740351003
<SOS> albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man . <EOS>	91.05945844890813
<SOS> franz was less enthusiastic ; but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering . <EOS>	69.86214027948859
<SOS> he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris ; and he had no doubt but that , with his eccentric character , his characteristic face , and his colossal fortune , he would produce a great effect there . <EOS>	95.08960029567946
<SOS> and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there . <EOS>	96.04702608111589
<SOS> the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing . <EOS>	73.29917531571252
<SOS> the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count , but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her , and , in spite of albert 's demonstrations of false modesty , he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days . <EOS>	69.93771653882365
<SOS> as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy , if we may credit travellers , the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity , but congratulated albert on his success . <EOS>	65.66437916426192
<SOS> they promised , upon separating , to meet at the duke of bracciano 's ball , to which all rome was invited . <EOS>	78.04771270649537
<SOS> the heroine of the bouquet kept her word ; she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after . <EOS>	64.34131004604622
<SOS> at length tuesday came , the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival . <EOS>	75.57579816894948
<SOS> on tuesday , the theatres open at ten o'clock in the morning , as lent begins after eight at night . <EOS>	59.35846862728126
<SOS> on tuesday , all those who through want of money , time , or enthusiasm , have not been to see the carnival before , mingle in the gayety , and contribute to the noise and excitement . <EOS>	84.64596614333266
<SOS> from two o'clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête , exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians , who crowded amongst the horses ' feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident , a single dispute , or a single fight . <EOS>	107.32231156974575
<SOS> the fêtes are veritable pleasure days to the italians . <EOS>	70.51930738224814
<SOS> the author of this history , who has resided five or six years in italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries . <EOS>	90.91290446266565
<SOS> albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume . <EOS>	115.21172960482127
<SOS> a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground . <EOS>	70.65096926353833
<SOS> in order that there might be no confusion , franz wore his peasant 's costume . <EOS>	73.14317214693823
<SOS> as the day advanced , the tumult became greater . <EOS>	76.73692835529737
<SOS> there was not on the pavement , in the carriages , at the windows , a single tongue that was silent , a single arm that did not move . <EOS>	83.6921618805444
<SOS> it was a human storm , made up of a thunder of cries , and a hail of sweetmeats , flowers , eggs , oranges , and nosegays . <EOS>	56.164571173629376
<SOS> at three o'clock the sound of fireworks , let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia ( heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion ) announced that the races were about to begin . <EOS>	67.07813673015248
<SOS> the races , like the moccoli , are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival . <EOS>	53.05538918761366
<SOS> at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks , and retired by the adjacent streets . <EOS>	83.70793161932903
<SOS> all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity , without the police interfering in the matter . <EOS>	72.24778989226593
<SOS> the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls ; then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard . <EOS>	56.88827165074704
<SOS> a detachment of carbineers , fifteen abreast , galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi . <EOS>	79.4383343014334
<SOS> when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia , a second volley of fireworks was discharged , to announce that the street was clear . <EOS>	80.25698385195575
<SOS> almost instantly , in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry , seven or eight horses , excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators , passed by like lightning . <EOS>	55.316295059560375
<SOS> then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won . <EOS>	69.02368482204552
<SOS> immediately , without any other signal , the carriages moved on , flowing on towards the corso , down all the streets , like torrents pent up for a while , which again flow into the parent river ; and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks . <EOS>	83.61299711625963
<SOS> a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd . <EOS>	60.4162169737977
<SOS> the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene . <EOS>	73.58643092067405
<SOS> the moccoli , or moccoletti , are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight , and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with , first , how to keep his own moccoletto alight ; and secondly , how to extinguish the moccoletti of others . <EOS>	95.6596966046919
<SOS> the moccoletto is like life : man has found but one means of transmitting it , and that one comes from god . <EOS>	70.62014039519512
<SOS> but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away , and the devil has somewhat aided him . <EOS>	76.85690406373949
<SOS> the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light . <EOS>	57.99283971997397
<SOS> but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto ? <EOS>	102.74490361873944
<SOS> the gigantic bellows , the monstrous extinguishers , the superhuman fans . <EOS>	44.40320570036975
<SOS> everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest . <EOS>	95.66357738498661
<SOS> the night was rapidly approaching ; and already , at the cry of `` moccoletti ! '' <EOS>	70.14162405964126
<SOS> repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors , two or three stars began to burn among the crowd . <EOS>	54.86644224931364
<SOS> it was a signal . <EOS>	84.34586805064731
<SOS> at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered , descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo , and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia . <EOS>	74.642649756983
<SOS> it seemed like the fête of jack o ' lanterns . <EOS>	46.98445904951393
<SOS> it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it . <EOS>	60.48622913029618
<SOS> suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth ; the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world . <EOS>	60.74255726389378
<SOS> the facchino follows the prince , the transteverin the citizen , everyone blowing , extinguishing , relighting . <EOS>	50.85394525191306
<SOS> had old æolus appeared at this moment , he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli , and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne . <EOS>	65.8526426296684
<SOS> this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours ; the corso was light as day ; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible . <EOS>	91.71510414877619
<SOS> every five minutes albert took out his watch ; at length it pointed to seven . <EOS>	62.27817119120861
<SOS> the two friends were in the via dei pontefici . <EOS>	84.6833264061448
<SOS> albert sprang out , bearing his moccoletto in his hand . <EOS>	56.703633152071674
<SOS> two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand ; but albert , a first rate pugilist , sent them rolling in the street , one after the other , and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo . <EOS>	81.03677376365117
<SOS> the steps were crowded with masks , who strove to snatch each other 's torches . <EOS>	54.566186810265485
<SOS> franz followed albert with his eyes , and saw him mount the first step . <EOS>	114.80321596076031
<SOS> instantly a mask , wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman , snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance . <EOS>	51.86403923815794
<SOS> franz was too far off to hear what they said ; but , without doubt , nothing hostile passed , for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl . <EOS>	62.625526969659106
<SOS> he watched them pass through the crowd for some time , but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello . <EOS>	62.44335647606803
<SOS> suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded , and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment . <EOS>	84.39784003231384
<SOS> it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone . <EOS>	92.6980842639438
<SOS> franz found himself in utter darkness . <EOS>	44.05396255467225
<SOS> no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows . <EOS>	83.32794341996272
<SOS> the carnival was over . <EOS>	81.91927634661955
<SOS> < num > m chapter < num > . <EOS>	56.33759072647868
<SOS> the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life , perhaps , franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression , so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness , as in this moment . <EOS>	68.5465759383707
<SOS> it seemed as though rome , under the magic breath of some demon of the night , had suddenly changed into a vast tomb . <EOS>	72.8049677509875
<SOS> by a chance , which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness , the moon , which was on the wane , did not rise until eleven o'clock , and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity . <EOS>	66.82131812954091
<SOS> the distance was short , and at the end of ten minutes his carriage , or rather the count 's , stopped before the hôtel de londres . <EOS>	72.47446476226165
<SOS> dinner was waiting , but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon , franz sat down without him . <EOS>	77.71716460229857
<SOS> signor pastrini , who had been accustomed to see them dine together , inquired into the cause of his absence , but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted . <EOS>	55.41440189317141
<SOS> the sudden extinction of the moccoletti , the darkness which had replaced the light , and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil , had left in franz 's mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness . <EOS>	57.21760022391035
<SOS> he therefore dined very silently , in spite of the officious attention of his host , who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything . <EOS>	57.434178843090976
<SOS> franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible . <EOS>	77.47592254265763
<SOS> he ordered the carriage , therefore , for eleven o'clock , desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel . <EOS>	76.80658123431817
<SOS> at eleven o'clock albert had not come back . <EOS>	108.53746594869283
<SOS> franz dressed himself , and went out , telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano 's . <EOS>	79.55990296235564
<SOS> the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome , the duchess , one of the last heiresses of the colonnas , does its honors with the most consummate grace , and thus their fêtes have a european celebrity . <EOS>	39.29844782207595
<SOS> franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them , and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion . <EOS>	85.1242321321811
<SOS> franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli , and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello . <EOS>	104.4228754560253
<SOS> `` then he has not returned ? '' <EOS>	95.63771166776789
<SOS> said the duke . <EOS>	85.84688112934623
<SOS> `` i waited for him until this hour , '' replied franz . <EOS>	74.43298494157557
<SOS> `` and do you know whither he went ? '' <EOS>	94.47609686265483
<SOS> `` no , not precisely ; however , i think it was something very like a rendezvous . '' <EOS>	93.58161036510508
<SOS> `` diavolo ! `` <EOS>	68.0202972675087
<SOS> said the duke , `` this is a bad day , or rather a bad night , to be out late ; is it not , countess ? '' <EOS>	61.00282584255761
<SOS> these words were addressed to the countess g , who had just arrived , and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia , the duke 's brother . <EOS>	59.08737596826533
<SOS> `` i think , on the contrary , that it is a charming night , '' replied the countess , `` and those who are here will complain of but one thing , that of its too rapid flight . '' <EOS>	56.18136290242593
<SOS> `` i am not speaking , '' said the duke with a smile , `` of the persons who are here ; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you , and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely ; i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome . '' <EOS>	49.46168394780307
<SOS> `` ah , '' asked the countess , `` who is out in the streets of rome at this hour , unless it be to go to a ball ? '' <EOS>	47.56968668353045
<SOS> `` our friend , albert de morcerf , countess , whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o'clock this evening , '' said franz , `` and whom i have not seen since . '' <EOS>	109.4928948804813
<SOS> `` and do n't you know where he is ? '' <EOS>	53.14883088904159
<SOS> `` not at all . '' <EOS>	47.11131780943328
<SOS> `` is he armed ? '' <EOS>	66.21600498649929
<SOS> `` he is in masquerade . '' <EOS>	46.05108566615339
<SOS> `` you should not have allowed him to go , '' said the duke to franz ; `` you , who know rome better than he does . '' <EOS>	59.25116100227801
<SOS> `` you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi , who gained the prize in the race today , '' replied franz ; `` and then moreover , what could happen to him ? '' <EOS>	95.06810749565639
<SOS> `` who can tell ? <EOS>	42.55330722075857
<SOS> the night is gloomy , and the tiber is very near the via macello . '' <EOS>	109.12215837530738
<SOS> franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude . <EOS>	94.40412911531082
<SOS> `` i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here , duke , '' said franz , `` and desired them to come and inform me of his return . '' <EOS>	71.9220875008234
<SOS> `` ah , '' replied the duke , `` here i think , is one of my servants who is seeking you . '' <EOS>	73.83589977530129
<SOS> the duke was not mistaken ; when he saw franz , the servant came up to him . <EOS>	82.87054397785177
<SOS> `` your excellency , '' he said , `` the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf . '' <EOS>	81.95804689515826
<SOS> `` a letter from the viscount ! '' <EOS>	64.45641240440945
<SOS> exclaimed franz . <EOS>	72.6619766982511
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	90.92554437792225
<SOS> `` and who is the man ? '' <EOS>	81.10494005169839
<SOS> `` i do not know . '' <EOS>	114.85392994229815
<SOS> `` why did he not bring it to me here ? '' <EOS>	76.34377949139899
<SOS> `` the messenger did not say . '' <EOS>	113.4099905966566
<SOS> `` and where is the messenger ? '' <EOS>	49.694645839351345
<SOS> `` he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you . '' <EOS>	59.31817624637297
<SOS> `` oh , '' said the countess to franz , `` go with all speed poor young man ! <EOS>	88.11258674769729
<SOS> perhaps some accident has happened to him . '' <EOS>	56.32293836095913
<SOS> `` i will hasten , '' replied franz . <EOS>	100.93582215911991
<SOS> `` shall we see you again to give us any information ? '' <EOS>	77.36229544600863
<SOS> inquired the countess . <EOS>	66.58177581878921
<SOS> `` yes , if it is not any serious affair , otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself . '' <EOS>	60.19995900346291
<SOS> `` be prudent , in any event , '' said the countess . <EOS>	62.21717236449075
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	58.74622057684945
<SOS> pray be assured of that . '' <EOS>	47.43773964297338
<SOS> franz took his hat and went away in haste . <EOS>	67.03292456941834
<SOS> he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o'clock ; fortunately the palazzo bracciano , which is on one side in the corso , and on the other in the square of the holy apostles , is hardly ten minutes ' walk from the hôtel de londres . <EOS>	70.65360180047519
<SOS> as he came near the hotel , franz saw a man in the middle of the street . <EOS>	63.05470592565824
<SOS> he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert . <EOS>	67.74521180688048
<SOS> the man was wrapped up in a large cloak . <EOS>	58.21796818480454
<SOS> he went up to him , but , to his extreme astonishment , the stranger first addressed him . <EOS>	108.02569083732725
<SOS> `` what wants your excellency of me ? '' <EOS>	102.4146715149808
<SOS> inquired the man , retreating a step or two , as if to keep on his guard . <EOS>	99.30602527174095
<SOS> `` are not you the person who brought me a letter , '' inquired franz , `` from the viscount of morcerf ? '' <EOS>	66.30908557890335
<SOS> `` your excellency lodges at pastrini 's hotel ? '' <EOS>	80.66547490695365
<SOS> `` i do . '' <EOS>	77.12692460914283
<SOS> `` your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount ? '' <EOS>	100.95690246235225
<SOS> `` i am . '' <EOS>	79.55211149150212
<SOS> `` your excellency 's name `` `` is the baron franz d'épinay . '' <EOS>	90.91888962372468
<SOS> < num > m `` then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed . '' <EOS>	71.4711216054911
<SOS> `` is there any answer ? '' <EOS>	100.30669944160172
<SOS> inquired franz , taking the letter from him . <EOS>	50.64746914544189
<SOS> `` yes your friend at least hopes so . '' <EOS>	65.01738619301939
<SOS> `` come upstairs with me , and i will give it to you . '' <EOS>	72.06242239302189
<SOS> `` i prefer waiting here , '' said the messenger , with a smile . <EOS>	65.31924438984115
<SOS> `` and why ? '' <EOS>	76.4865424627826
<SOS> `` your excellency will know when you have read the letter . '' <EOS>	102.99731982107693
<SOS> `` shall i find you here , then ? '' <EOS>	49.49605497451143
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	107.64369533094586
<SOS> franz entered the hotel . <EOS>	83.15628907621011
<SOS> on the staircase he met signor pastrini . <EOS>	74.31779255193634
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	74.9267126901715
<SOS> said the landlord . <EOS>	69.67628303679751
<SOS> `` well what ? '' <EOS>	86.19443103663548
<SOS> responded franz . <EOS>	104.05703863430773
<SOS> `` you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend ? '' <EOS>	88.00145097969465
<SOS> he asked of franz . <EOS>	49.14815391627493
<SOS> `` yes , i have seen him , '' he replied , `` and he has handed this letter to me . <EOS>	66.46906072573498
<SOS> light the candles in my apartment , if you please . '' <EOS>	98.25485501794805
<SOS> the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light . <EOS>	93.36226232472676
<SOS> the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed , and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert 's letter ; and so he went instantly towards the waxlight , and unfolded it . <EOS>	81.86746285058805
<SOS> it was written and signed by albert . <EOS>	62.38182787536187
<SOS> franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained . <EOS>	80.94709511606236
<SOS> it was thus worded : `` my dear fellow , `` the moment you have received this , have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket book , which you will find in the square drawer of the secrétaire ; add your own to it , if it be not sufficient . <EOS>	114.00060366547325
<SOS> run to torlonia , draw from him instantly four thousand piastres , and give them to the bearer . <EOS>	62.168156095778045
<SOS> it is urgent that i should have this money without delay . <EOS>	66.39530696470375
<SOS> i do not say more , relying on you as you may rely on me . <EOS>	75.20900732580019
<SOS> `` your friend , `` albert de morcerf . <EOS>	93.61121781147716
<SOS> `` p.s . <EOS>	61.28748707144252
<SOS> i now believe in italian banditti . '' <EOS>	107.52280603428454
<SOS> below these lines were written , in a strange hand , the following in italian : `` se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere . <EOS>	85.29323970528604
<SOS> `` luigi vampa . '' <EOS>	53.805855512112
<SOS> `` if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands , by seven o'clock the count albert will have ceased to live . '' <EOS>	90.88596682309006
<SOS> this second signature explained everything to franz , who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment ; the street was safer for him . <EOS>	62.30320924843525
<SOS> albert , then , had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief , in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe . <EOS>	44.14712021900643
<SOS> there was no time to lose . <EOS>	58.364299607552006
<SOS> he hastened to open the secrétaire , and found the pocket book in the drawer , and in it the letter of credit . <EOS>	49.54605588193017
<SOS> there were in all six thousand piastres , but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand . <EOS>	62.7104442499008
<SOS> as to franz , he had no letter of credit , as he lived at florence , and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days ; he had brought but a hundred louis , and of these he had not more than fifty left . <EOS>	62.558402975408235
<SOS> thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required . <EOS>	53.947286456581395
<SOS> true , he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia . <EOS>	101.07870018121099
<SOS> he was , therefore , about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time , when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind . <EOS>	69.63674694342419
<SOS> he remembered the count of monte cristo . <EOS>	95.80120574360014
<SOS> franz was about to ring for signor pastrini , when that worthy presented himself . <EOS>	90.94976856815767
<SOS> `` my dear sir , '' he said , hastily , `` do you know if the count is within ? '' <EOS>	60.06851495355944
<SOS> `` yes , your excellency ; he has this moment returned . '' <EOS>	98.51838941400112
<SOS> `` is he in bed ? '' <EOS>	60.95236971015696
<SOS> `` i should say no . '' <EOS>	91.33033798802722
<SOS> `` then ring at his door , if you please , and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience . '' <EOS>	65.76927817912173
<SOS> signor pastrini did as he was desired , and returning five minutes after , he said : `` the count awaits your excellency . '' <EOS>	55.30286948266912
<SOS> franz went along the corridor , and a servant introduced him to the count . <EOS>	93.6670905342194
<SOS> he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen , and which was surrounded with divans . <EOS>	58.37913421383464
<SOS> the count came towards him . <EOS>	67.47771407322715
<SOS> `` well , what good wind blows you hither at this hour ? '' <EOS>	71.72973501861468
<SOS> said he ; `` have you come to sup with me ? <EOS>	48.01165092795904
<SOS> it would be very kind of you . '' <EOS>	68.18858085539965
<SOS> `` no ; i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter . '' <EOS>	65.65221746867091
<SOS> `` a serious matter , '' said the count , looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him ; `` and what may it be ? '' <EOS>	57.7746126538624
<SOS> `` are we alone ? '' <EOS>	52.05751982430992
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the count , going to the door , and returning . <EOS>	64.45107071821707
<SOS> franz gave him albert 's letter . <EOS>	72.19653880256045
<SOS> `` read that , '' he said . <EOS>	70.90837853861092
<SOS> the count read it . <EOS>	47.26460113537009
<SOS> `` well , well ! '' <EOS>	43.87073915027333
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	71.99093098978594
<SOS> `` did you see the postscript ? '' <EOS>	63.58527452718429
<SOS> `` i did , indeed. `` <EOS>	54.01839352382831
<SOS> 'se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere . <EOS>	72.28283620933293
<SOS> `` 'luigi vampa . ' '' <EOS>	92.37994832332215
<SOS> `` what think you of that ? '' <EOS>	71.14963115698458
<SOS> inquired franz . <EOS>	104.98637158418775
<SOS> `` have you the money he demands ? '' <EOS>	109.34925818375714
<SOS> `` yes , all but eight hundred piastres . '' <EOS>	70.39599531351624
<SOS> the count went to his secrétaire , opened it , and pulling out a drawer filled with gold , said to franz , `` i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself . '' <EOS>	103.24803314958804
<SOS> `` you see , on the contrary , i come to you first and instantly , '' replied franz . <EOS>	101.82663107123851
<SOS> `` and i thank you ; have what you will ; '' and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased . <EOS>	66.78603205201092
<SOS> `` is it absolutely necessary , then , to send the money to luigi vampa ? '' <EOS>	123.1252815100643
<SOS> asked the young man , looking fixedly in his turn at the count . <EOS>	68.87523238740711
<SOS> `` judge for yourself , '' replied he . <EOS>	49.56244462243707
<SOS> `` the postscript is explicit . '' <EOS>	50.002636824289645
<SOS> `` i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting , you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation , '' said franz . <EOS>	81.96352972698232
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	53.256811052590294
<SOS> returned the count , with surprise . <EOS>	91.14162698985368
<SOS> `` if we were to go together to luigi vampa , i am sure he would not refuse you albert 's freedom . '' <EOS>	54.52371707577471
<SOS> `` what influence can i possibly have over a bandit ? '' <EOS>	101.80496136360692
<SOS> `` have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten ? '' <EOS>	73.68206872534714

<SOS> `` well , well , '' said the count , `` who told you that ? '' <EOS>	66.21365138914999
<SOS> `` no matter ; i know it . '' <EOS>	53.786038730948455
<SOS> the count knit his brows , and remained silent an instant . <EOS>	66.98010754407053
<SOS> `` and if i went to seek vampa , would you accompany me ? '' <EOS>	85.71274163242329

<SOS> `` he awaits the answer ? '' <EOS>	63.584938886854964

<SOS> `` to your apartments , perhaps ; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine . '' <EOS>	115.36565493895262
<SOS> the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street , and whistled in a peculiar manner . <EOS>	50.40302225494211
<SOS> the man in the mantle quitted the wall , and advanced into the middle of the street. `` <EOS>	71.96820015283046
<SOS> salite ! `` <EOS>	44.5978199263172
<SOS> said the count , in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant . <EOS>	75.52256325592744
<SOS> the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation , but rather with alacrity , and , mounting the steps at a bound , entered the hotel ; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room . <EOS>	53.85939608384146
<SOS> `` ah , it is you , peppino , '' said the count . <EOS>	89.50228406900648
<SOS> but peppino , instead of answering , threw himself on his knees , seized the count 's hand , and covered it with kisses . <EOS>	122.90398652290573
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the count , `` you have , then , not forgotten that i saved your life ; that is strange , for it is a week ago . '' <EOS>	77.51299180060103
<SOS> < num > m `` no , excellency ; and never shall i forget it , '' returned peppino , with an accent of profound gratitude . <EOS>	47.887755380283146
<SOS> `` never ? <EOS>	68.70081041442965
<SOS> that is a long time ; but it is something that you believe so . <EOS>	75.32598994070591
<SOS> rise and answer . '' <EOS>	99.03921032550265
<SOS> peppino glanced anxiously at franz . <EOS>	69.43101148941113
<SOS> `` oh , you may speak before his excellency , '' said he ; `` he is one of my friends . <EOS>	77.75432004758873

<SOS> continued the count in french , `` it is necessary to excite this man 's confidence . '' <EOS>	51.963733358620274
<SOS> `` you can speak before me , '' said franz ; `` i am a friend of the count 's . '' <EOS>	46.583706399151126
<SOS> `` good ! '' <EOS>	92.58681998023276
<SOS> returned peppino . <EOS>	54.15801675755021
<SOS> `` i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me . '' <EOS>	77.91587867236602
<SOS> `` how did the viscount albert fall into luigi 's hands ? '' <EOS>	97.20779523229147
<SOS> `` excellency , the frenchman 's carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa . '' <EOS>	52.011379413954955
<SOS> `` the chief 's mistress ? '' <EOS>	70.606248148755
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	52.62474087414302
<SOS> the frenchman threw her a bouquet ; teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief , who was in the carriage . '' <EOS>	59.658676479254
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	86.07029415734141
<SOS> cried franz , `` was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants ? '' <EOS>	43.62589945985119
<SOS> `` it was he who drove , disguised as the coachman , '' replied peppino . <EOS>	53.483923021927865
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	83.84977826678885
<SOS> said the count . <EOS>	78.41719983429982
<SOS> `` well , then , the frenchman took off his mask ; teresa , with the chief 's consent , did the same . <EOS>	83.96590068290922
<SOS> the frenchman asked for a rendezvous ; teresa gave him one only , instead of teresa , it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo . '' <EOS>	78.69585264867072
<SOS> `` what ! '' <EOS>	93.01537433964896
<SOS> exclaimed franz , `` the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him `` `` was a lad of fifteen , '' replied peppino . <EOS>	63.0601556730798
<SOS> `` but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived ; beppo has taken in plenty of others . '' <EOS>	82.00736146926964
<SOS> `` and beppo led him outside the walls ? '' <EOS>	75.86692911322939
<SOS> said the count . <EOS>	78.78896751825351
<SOS> `` exactly so ; a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello . <EOS>	57.73088702686925
<SOS> beppo got in , inviting the frenchman to follow him , and he did not wait to be asked twice . <EOS>	57.66414209935003
<SOS> he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo , and sat by him . <EOS>	67.37474023493996
<SOS> beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome ; the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world . <EOS>	53.1413757729708
<SOS> the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo ; and when they were two hundred yards outside , as the frenchman became somewhat too forward , beppo put a brace of pistols to his head , the coachman pulled up and did the same . <EOS>	73.46497823097273
<SOS> at the same time , four of the band , who were concealed on the banks of the almo , surrounded the carriage . <EOS>	101.74317393736254
<SOS> the frenchman made some resistance , and nearly strangled beppo ; but he could not resist five armed men , and was forced to yield . <EOS>	83.38122597669545
<SOS> they made him get out , walk along the banks of the river , and then brought him to teresa and luigi , who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st . <EOS>	38.36050858782322
<SOS> sebastian . '' <EOS>	82.27657007002321
<SOS> `` well , '' said the count , turning towards franz , `` it seems to me that this is a very likely story . <EOS>	116.86516680726459
<SOS> what do you say to it ? '' <EOS>	92.62456281878603
<SOS> `` why , that i should think it very amusing , '' replied franz , `` if it had happened to anyone but poor albert . '' <EOS>	85.12875189367625
<SOS> `` and , in truth , if you had not found me here , '' said the count , `` it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear ; but now , be assured , his alarm will be the only serious consequence . '' <EOS>	61.43005619770371
<SOS> `` and shall we go and find him ? '' <EOS>	99.1656121851193
<SOS> inquired franz . <EOS>	70.15386042835692
<SOS> `` oh , decidedly , sir . <EOS>	114.88051178691043
<SOS> he is in a very picturesque place do you know the catacombs of st . <EOS>	45.15126409429221
<SOS> sebastian ? '' <EOS>	86.67578669209823
<SOS> `` i was never in them ; but i have often resolved to visit them . '' <EOS>	51.3635943207712
<SOS> `` well , here is an opportunity made to your hand , and it would be difficult to contrive a better . <EOS>	72.76721472408167
<SOS> have you a carriage ? '' <EOS>	82.00350114088488
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	93.87100936439532
<SOS> `` that is of no consequence ; i always have one ready , day and night . '' <EOS>	65.30626313660531
<SOS> `` always ready ? '' <EOS>	54.792857960586815
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	62.67771065610355
<SOS> i am a very capricious being , and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise , or after my dinner , or in the middle of the night , i resolve on starting for some particular point , and away i go . '' <EOS>	87.84168274533123
<SOS> the count rang , and a footman appeared . <EOS>	51.12273606870828
<SOS> `` order out the carriage , '' he said , `` and remove the pistols which are in the holsters . <EOS>	42.00288662683117
<SOS> you need not awaken the coachman ; ali will drive . '' <EOS>	73.63070233476351
<SOS> in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard , and the carriage stopped at the door . <EOS>	63.203177387081865
<SOS> the count took out his watch . <EOS>	79.31254227265
<SOS> `` half past twelve , '' he said . <EOS>	104.59439845161049
<SOS> `` we might start at five o'clock and be in time , but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night , and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels . <EOS>	64.33204432001601
<SOS> are you still resolved to accompany me ? '' <EOS>	105.41027082196668
<SOS> `` more determined than ever . '' <EOS>	78.14149879584325
<SOS> `` well , then , come along . '' <EOS>	96.04056437058892
<SOS> franz and the count went downstairs , accompanied by peppino . <EOS>	79.95493694889511
<SOS> at the door they found the carriage . <EOS>	71.95823513563019
<SOS> ali was on the box , in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo . <EOS>	71.20470351711305
<SOS> franz and the count got into the carriage . <EOS>	57.744441769148295
<SOS> peppino placed himself beside ali , and they set off at a rapid pace . <EOS>	73.67600829621027
<SOS> ali had received his instructions , and went down the corso , crossed the campo vaccino , went up the strada san gregorio , and reached the gates of st. sebastian . <EOS>	51.833319642378626
<SOS> then the porter raised some difficulties , but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome , allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night ; the portcullis was therefore raised , the porter had a louis for his trouble , and they went on their way . <EOS>	79.10042506730231
<SOS> the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way , and bordered with tombs . <EOS>	81.63556132267496
<SOS> from time to time , by the light of the moon , which began to rise , franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins , and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino . <EOS>	73.37186527473378
<SOS> a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped , peppino opened the door , and the count and franz alighted . <EOS>	64.04587023942713
<SOS> `` in ten minutes , '' said the count to his companion , `` we shall be there . '' <EOS>	78.02494627150959
<SOS> he then took peppino aside , gave him an order in a low voice , and peppino went away , taking with him a torch , brought with them in the carriage . <EOS>	86.01178082700353
<SOS> five minutes elapsed , during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna ; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage , which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion . <EOS>	116.6146716302796
<SOS> `` now , '' said the count , `` let us follow him . '' <EOS>	81.94002214789126
<SOS> franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path , which , at the distance of a hundred paces , led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley . <EOS>	73.20260790758277
<SOS> they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity . <EOS>	101.3811335059135
<SOS> `` ought we to go on ? '' <EOS>	60.42699054382796
<SOS> asked franz of the count ; `` or should we pause ? '' <EOS>	105.54161135019412
<SOS> `` let us go on ; peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming . '' <EOS>	104.06157393808799
<SOS> one of the two men was peppino , and the other a bandit on the lookout . <EOS>	88.20116802985737
<SOS> franz and the count advanced , and the bandit saluted them . <EOS>	70.51426286784113
<SOS> `` your excellency , '' said peppino , addressing the count , `` if you will follow me , the opening of the catacombs is close at hand . '' <EOS>	62.23724347896023
<SOS> `` go on , then , '' replied the count . <EOS>	55.86785131089566
<SOS> they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks , by which a man could scarcely pass . <EOS>	70.57484487003381
<SOS> peppino glided first into this crevice ; after they got along a few paces the passage widened . <EOS>	75.76743478010398
<SOS> peppino passed , lighted his torch , and turned to see if they came after him . <EOS>	70.93455081880602
<SOS> the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely . <EOS>	83.37898273588857
<SOS> the passageway sloped in a gentle descent , enlarging as they proceeded ; still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture , and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another . <EOS>	49.0341724244521
<SOS> they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way , and then were stopped by , `` who comes there ? '' <EOS>	48.114868177173385
<SOS> at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel . <EOS>	111.4046482759043
<SOS> `` a friend ! '' <EOS>	106.31149306701549
<SOS> responded peppino ; and , advancing alone towards the sentry , he said a few words to him in a low tone ; and then he , like the first , saluted the nocturnal visitors , making a sign that they might proceed . <EOS>	91.73682888733727
<SOS> behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps . <EOS>	66.80089892857728
<SOS> franz and the count descended these , and found themselves in a mortuary chamber . <EOS>	75.24308336393148
<SOS> five corridors diverged like the rays of a star , and the walls , dug into niches , which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins , showed that they were at last in the catacombs . <EOS>	51.10228796751655
<SOS> down one of the corridors , whose extent it was impossible to determine , rays of light were visible . <EOS>	74.56026667483546
<SOS> the count laid his hand on franz 's shoulder . <EOS>	41.5308707838971
<SOS> `` would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose ? '' <EOS>	46.27321551921555
<SOS> he inquired . <EOS>	65.73058048832527
<SOS> `` exceedingly , '' replied franz . <EOS>	87.72455090106443
<SOS> `` come with me , then . <EOS>	107.29867230693789
<SOS> peppino , put out the torch . '' <EOS>	87.69723101569265
<SOS> peppino obeyed , and franz and the count were in utter darkness , except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare , more evident since peppino had put out his torch , was visible along the wall . <EOS>	108.76056996464993
<SOS> they advanced silently , the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark . <EOS>	69.46935774777866
<SOS> franz himself , however , saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light , which served in some manner as a guide . <EOS>	75.8546417688456
<SOS> three arcades were before them , and the middle one was used as a door . <EOS>	62.918590140487225
<SOS> these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were , and on the other into a large square chamber , entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken . <EOS>	71.2405266841312
<SOS> in the midst of this chamber were four stones , which had formerly served as an altar , as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them . <EOS>	95.24885863278077
<SOS> a lamp , placed at the base of a pillar , lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow . <EOS>	80.8007893824302
<SOS> a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column , and was reading with his back turned to the arcades , through the openings of which the new comers contemplated him . <EOS>	63.84080313521062
<SOS> this was the chief of the band , luigi vampa . <EOS>	95.41287610888966
<SOS> around him , and in groups , according to their fancy , lying in their mantles , or with their backs against a sort of stone bench , which went all round the columbarium , were to be seen twenty brigands or more , each having his carbine within reach . <EOS>	70.93129122410188
<SOS> at the other end , silent , scarcely visible , and like a shadow , was a sentinel , who was walking up and down before a grotto , which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere . <EOS>	49.998133486811305
<SOS> when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau , he raised his finger to his lips , to warn him to be silent , and , ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium , entered the chamber by the middle arcade , and advanced towards vampa , who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps . <EOS>	53.31870897051505
<SOS> `` who comes there ? '' <EOS>	83.71411193145602
<SOS> cried the sentinel , who was less abstracted , and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief . <EOS>	66.9391513802573
<SOS> at this challenge , vampa rose quickly , drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle . <EOS>	63.32005920371599
<SOS> in a moment all the bandits were on their feet , and twenty carbines were levelled at the count . <EOS>	63.328227596119305
<SOS> `` well , '' said he in a voice perfectly calm , and no muscle of his countenance disturbed , `` well , my dear vampa , it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony . '' <EOS>	57.42113652135662
<SOS> < num > m `` ground arms , '' exclaimed the chief , with an imperative sign of the hand , while with the other he took off his hat respectfully ; then , turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene , he said , `` your pardon , your excellency , but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit , that i did not really recognize you . '' <EOS>	66.61515642705513
<SOS> `` it seems that your memory is equally short in everything , vampa , '' said the count , `` and that not only do you forget people 's faces , but also the conditions you make with them . '' <EOS>	80.9292979118544
<SOS> `` what conditions have i forgotten , your excellency ? '' <EOS>	68.0491979301699
<SOS> inquired the bandit , with the air of a man who , having committed an error , is anxious to repair it . <EOS>	87.81368741451281
<SOS> `` was it not agreed , '' asked the count , `` that not only my person , but also that of my friends , should be respected by you ? '' <EOS>	58.710653455567126
<SOS> `` and how have i broken that treaty , your excellency ? '' <EOS>	60.92322943144506
<SOS> `` you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf . <EOS>	87.72215652156248
<SOS> well , '' continued the count , in a tone that made franz shudder , `` this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage , and yet , i repeat to you , you have carried him off , and conveyed him hither , and , '' added the count , taking the letter from his pocket , `` you have set a ransom on him , as if he were an utter stranger . '' <EOS>	94.48672901431199
<SOS> `` why did you not tell me all this you ? '' <EOS>	71.35379688196664
<SOS> inquired the brigand chief , turning towards his men , who all retreated before his look . <EOS>	113.65847246202416
<SOS> `` why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count , who has all our lives in his hands ? <EOS>	78.26919455006167
<SOS> by heavens ! <EOS>	67.69025937307646
<SOS> if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency , i would blow his brains out with my own hand ! '' <EOS>	78.85725716860647
<SOS> < num > m `` well , '' said the count , turning towards franz , `` i told you there was some mistake in this . '' <EOS>	78.93335837142837
<SOS> `` are you not alone ? '' <EOS>	86.62751582080301
<SOS> asked vampa with uneasiness . <EOS>	62.311313530261664
<SOS> `` i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed , and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word . <EOS>	102.14185731192705
<SOS> come , your excellency , '' the count added , turning to franz , `` here is luigi vampa , who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed . '' <EOS>	64.06810193217005
<SOS> franz approached , the chief advancing several steps to meet him . <EOS>	81.18555272529716
<SOS> `` welcome among us , your excellency , '' he said to him ; `` you heard what the count just said , and also my reply ; let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend 's ransom , that this had happened . '' <EOS>	106.47040022235787
<SOS> `` but , '' said franz , looking round him uneasily , `` where is the viscount ? <EOS>	113.07252712551859
<SOS> i do not see him . '' <EOS>	85.43709843814709
<SOS> `` nothing has happened to him , i hope , '' said the count frowningly . <EOS>	83.24014801995833
<SOS> `` the prisoner is there , '' replied vampa , pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard , `` and i will go myself and tell him he is free . '' <EOS>	70.911663640112
<SOS> the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert 's prison , and franz and the count followed him . <EOS>	52.8122526479529
<SOS> `` what is the prisoner doing ? '' <EOS>	58.82420053474524
<SOS> inquired vampa of the sentinel. `` <EOS>	41.91587743212696
<SOS> ma foi , captain , '' replied the sentry , `` i do not know ; for the last hour i have not heard him stir . '' <EOS>	103.61573920156803
<SOS> `` come in , your excellency , '' said vampa . <EOS>	75.0096016267083
<SOS> the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief , who drew back a bolt and opened a door . <EOS>	54.4956015311171
<SOS> then , by the gleam of a lamp , similar to that which lighted the columbarium , albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him , lying in a corner in profound slumber . <EOS>	120.15966685026935
<SOS> `` come , '' said the count , smiling with his own peculiar smile , `` not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o'clock tomorrow morning . '' <EOS>	91.98520883578698
<SOS> vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration ; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage . <EOS>	85.34551117713654
<SOS> `` you are right , your excellency , '' he said ; `` this must be one of your friends . '' <EOS>	87.5743841534882
<SOS> then going to albert , he touched him on the shoulder , saying , `` will your excellency please to awaken ? '' <EOS>	56.32111885124627
<SOS> albert stretched out his arms , rubbed his eyelids , and opened his eyes . <EOS>	70.09908990469306
<SOS> `` oh , '' said he , `` is it you , captain ? <EOS>	66.5914525965502
<SOS> you should have allowed me to sleep . <EOS>	72.89188087880851
<SOS> i had such a delightful dream . <EOS>	80.8500540280343
<SOS> i was dancing the galop at torlonia 's with the countess g . '' <EOS>	58.796426897307484
<SOS> then he drew his watch from his pocket , that he might see how time sped . <EOS>	87.56785092738116
<SOS> `` half past one only ? '' <EOS>	54.326333589614016
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	81.94597152934273
<SOS> `` why the devil do you rouse me at this hour ? '' <EOS>	60.38523706578619
<SOS> `` to tell you that you are free , your excellency . '' <EOS>	88.86051542611608
<SOS> `` my dear fellow , '' replied albert , with perfect ease of mind , `` remember , for the future , napoleon 's maxim , 'never awaken me but for bad news ; ' if you had let me sleep on , i should have finished my galop , and have been grateful to you all my life . <EOS>	82.33248172024477
<SOS> so , then , they have paid my ransom ? '' <EOS>	64.18657865693976
<SOS> `` no , your excellency . '' <EOS>	81.63945169912007
<SOS> `` well , then , how am i free ? '' <EOS>	67.41663670194855
<SOS> `` a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you . '' <EOS>	96.44413459098566
<SOS> `` come hither ? '' <EOS>	49.54644452001094
<SOS> `` yes , hither . '' <EOS>	55.60497341100803
<SOS> `` really ? <EOS>	99.51281567531568
<SOS> then that person is a most amiable person . '' <EOS>	44.84436864761673
<SOS> albert looked around and perceived franz . <EOS>	86.7023091127963
<SOS> `` what , '' said he , `` is it you , my dear franz , whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed ? '' <EOS>	41.09522569664361
<SOS> `` no , not i , '' replied franz , `` but our neighbor , the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	72.681803278451
<SOS> `` oh , my dear count , '' said albert gayly , arranging his cravat and wristbands , `` you are really most kind , and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you , in the first place for the carriage , and in the next for this visit , '' and he put out his hand to the count , who shuddered as he gave his own , but who nevertheless did give it . <EOS>	56.5180660435915
<SOS> the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement ; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him , and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered ; as for franz , he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit . <EOS>	47.13082371232696
<SOS> `` my dear albert , '' he said , `` if you will make haste , we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia 's . <EOS>	68.60696648037997
<SOS> you may conclude your interrupted galop , so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi , who has , indeed , throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman . '' <EOS>	47.88508477919608
<SOS> `` you are decidedly right , and we may reach the palazzo by two o'clock . <EOS>	73.19412356138014
<SOS> signor luigi , '' continued albert , `` is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency ? '' <EOS>	77.01800925166079
<SOS> `` none , sir , '' replied the bandit , `` you are as free as air . '' <EOS>	110.04949119104808
<SOS> `` well , then , a happy and merry life to you . <EOS>	56.53937585279926
<SOS> come , gentlemen , come . '' <EOS>	79.4508481890703
<SOS> and albert , followed by franz and the count , descended the staircase , crossed the square chamber , where stood all the bandits , hat in hand . <EOS>	75.43192048192525
<SOS> `` peppino , '' said the brigand chief , `` give me the torch . '' <EOS>	82.36006451162514
<SOS> `` what are you going to do ? '' <EOS>	57.85775575925147
<SOS> inquired the count . <EOS>	54.464014707577896
<SOS> `` i will show you the way back myself , '' said the captain ; `` that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency . '' <EOS>	61.63945838138771
<SOS> and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman , he preceded his guests , not as a servant who performs an act of civility , but like a king who precedes ambassadors . <EOS>	67.19348924523283
<SOS> on reaching the door , he bowed . <EOS>	108.56017783805618
<SOS> `` and now , your excellency , '' added he , `` allow me to repeat my apologies , and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred . '' <EOS>	82.54594472350445
<SOS> `` no , my dear vampa , '' replied the count ; `` besides , you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way , that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them . '' <EOS>	89.17208809930933
<SOS> < num > m `` gentlemen , '' added the chief , turning towards the young men , `` perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you ; but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit , wherever i may be , you shall be welcome . '' <EOS>	81.6441929211485
<SOS> franz and albert bowed . <EOS>	57.107482483918226
<SOS> the count went out first , then albert . <EOS>	97.69435338763637
<SOS> franz paused for a moment . <EOS>	74.9769120660952
<SOS> `` has your excellency anything to ask me ? '' <EOS>	93.24342202439101
<SOS> said vampa with a smile . <EOS>	101.93364578799127
<SOS> `` yes , i have , '' replied franz ; `` i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered . '' <EOS>	67.89292001255926
<SOS> `` cæsar 's commentaries , '' said the bandit , `` it is my favorite work . '' <EOS>	84.83800446565657
<SOS> `` well , are you coming ? '' <EOS>	73.55393603866132
<SOS> asked albert . <EOS>	77.55214002513725
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied franz , `` here i am , '' and he , in his turn , left the caves . <EOS>	81.63931826841427
<SOS> they advanced to the plain . <EOS>	107.6401678941603
<SOS> `` ah , your pardon , '' said albert , turning round ; `` will you allow me , captain ? '' <EOS>	80.94804558469525
<SOS> and he lighted his cigar at vampa 's torch . <EOS>	97.93601655081763
<SOS> `` now , my dear count , '' he said , `` let us on with all the speed we may . <EOS>	90.03116706608114
<SOS> i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano 's . '' <EOS>	52.959235782419675
<SOS> they found the carriage where they had left it . <EOS>	47.171500866600056
<SOS> the count said a word in arabic to ali , and the horses went on at great speed . <EOS>	67.76660317947248
<SOS> it was just two o'clock by albert 's watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room . <EOS>	114.14128567565344
<SOS> their return was quite an event , but as they entered together , all uneasiness on albert 's account ceased instantly . <EOS>	88.90181607515153
<SOS> `` madame , '' said the viscount of morcerf , advancing towards the countess , `` yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop ; i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise , but here is my friend , whose character for veracity you well know , and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine . '' <EOS>	104.58939772862158
<SOS> and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz , albert put his arm round the waist of the countess , and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers . <EOS>	70.3823878155745
<SOS> in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to albert . <EOS>	79.15895712055513
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	93.19568566555012
<SOS> the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend , on the following morning , contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count ; true , the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening ; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged . <EOS>	90.57243817494809
<SOS> franz , who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count , in which terror was strangely mingled , felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him , and therefore made no objection to albert 's request , but at once accompanied him to the desired spot , and , after a short delay , the count joined them in the salon . <EOS>	67.19596678482907
<SOS> `` my dear count , '' said albert , advancing to meet him , `` permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night , and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory ; believe me , as long as i live , i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me ; and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life . '' <EOS>	90.29107246928766
<SOS> `` my very good friend and excellent neighbor , '' replied the count , with a smile , `` you really exaggerate my trifling exertions . <EOS>	72.4853623390759
<SOS> you owe me nothing but some trifle of < num > , < num > francs , which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses , so that there is not much of a score between us ; but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate , and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take . '' <EOS>	117.77780023110232
<SOS> `` upon my word , '' said albert , `` i deserve no credit for what i could not help , namely , a determination to take everything as i found it , and to let those bandits see , that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world , there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself . <EOS>	49.99876694399917
<SOS> all that , however , has nothing to do with my obligations to you , and i now come to ask you whether , in my own person , my family , or connections , i can in any way serve you ? <EOS>	96.40741076269836
<SOS> my father , the comte de morcerf , although of spanish origin , possesses considerable influence , both at the court of france and madrid , and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself , and all to whom my life is dear , at your disposal . '' <EOS>	100.7733192397721
<SOS> `` monsieur de morcerf , '' replied the count , `` your offer , far from surprising me , is precisely what i expected from you , and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made ; nay , i will go still further , and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands . '' <EOS>	107.0099589264059
<SOS> `` oh , pray name it . '' <EOS>	82.02368440236401
<SOS> `` i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen . '' <EOS>	76.96964277221763
<SOS> `` is it possible , '' exclaimed albert , `` that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world ? <EOS>	54.19179003722392
<SOS> i can scarcely credit it . '' <EOS>	76.35234625733163
<SOS> `` nevertheless , it is quite true ; still , i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way , and calls for immediate correction ; but , in all probability , i should have performed so important , so necessary a duty , as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital , had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world , but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there , and , of necessity , was compelled to abandon the idea . '' <EOS>	62.561502946408005
<SOS> `` so distinguished an individual as yourself , '' cried albert , `` could scarcely have required an introduction . '' <EOS>	113.45476230059268
<SOS> `` you are most kind ; but as regards myself , i can find no merit i possess , save that , as a millionaire , i might have become a partner in the speculations of m. aguado and m. rothschild ; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks , i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution . <EOS>	56.518994037797995
<SOS> your offer , however , smooths all difficulties , and i have only to ask you , my dear m. de morcerf '' ( these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile ) , `` whether you undertake , upon my arrival in france , to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china ? '' <EOS>	46.089464994327734
<SOS> `` oh , that i do , and with infinite pleasure , '' answered albert ; `` and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris , in consequence of a treaty of marriage ( my dear franz , do not smile , i beg of you ) with a family of high standing , and connected with the very cream of parisian society . '' <EOS>	95.10034675398161
<SOS> `` connected by marriage , you mean , '' said franz , laughingly . <EOS>	70.96868042263966
<SOS> `` well , never mind how it is , '' answered albert , `` it comes to the same thing in the end . <EOS>	55.368943168675685
<SOS> perhaps by the time you return to paris , i shall be quite a sober , staid father of a family ! <EOS>	50.67637305521951
<SOS> a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues do n't you think so ? <EOS>	43.7946768446542
<SOS> but as regards your wish to visit our fine city , my dear count , i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please . '' <EOS>	91.15156842109457
<SOS> `` then it is settled , '' said the count , `` and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated . '' <EOS>	66.63930832830656
<SOS> franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo , and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely , hoping to read something of his purpose in his face , but his countenance was inscrutable especially when , as in the present case , it was veiled in a sphinx like smile . <EOS>	116.73103778069357
<SOS> `` but tell me now , count , '' exclaimed albert , delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo ; `` tell me truly whether you are in earnest , or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives , but which , like a house built on the sand , is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind ? '' <EOS>	80.38761453323617
<SOS> `` i pledge you my honor , '' returned the count , `` that i mean to do as i have said ; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris . '' <EOS>	78.33909860621934
<SOS> `` when do you propose going thither ? '' <EOS>	95.71579627855319
<SOS> `` have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself ? '' <EOS>	67.2893593106892
<SOS> `` certainly i have ; in a fortnight or three weeks ' time , that is to say , as fast as i can get there ! '' <EOS>	66.03940223890002
<SOS> `` nay , '' said the count ; `` i will give you three months ere i join you ; you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties . <EOS>	69.04686053286716
<SOS> `` and in three months ' time , '' said albert , `` you will be at my house ? '' <EOS>	82.35926792595936
<SOS> `` shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour ? '' <EOS>	84.2929627010911
<SOS> inquired the count ; `` only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements . '' <EOS>	64.61880325335767
<SOS> `` day for day , hour for hour , '' said albert ; `` that will suit me to a dot . '' <EOS>	78.4770102244809
<SOS> `` so be it , then , '' replied the count , and extending his hand towards a calendar , suspended near the chimney piece , he said , `` today is the < num > st of february ; '' and drawing out his watch , added , `` it is exactly half past ten o'clock . <EOS>	68.46026279788286
<SOS> now promise me to remember this , and expect me the < num > st of may at the same hour in the forenoon . '' <EOS>	73.83883298125556
<SOS> `` capital ! '' <EOS>	87.11924084313596
<SOS> exclaimed albert ; `` your breakfast shall be waiting . '' <EOS>	70.53264195443295
<SOS> `` where do you live ? '' <EOS>	80.71861140235772

<SOS> `` i reside in my father 's house , but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard , entirely separated from the main building . '' <EOS>	64.98223527120116

<SOS> `` that depends ; when do you leave ? '' <EOS>	59.904667434764804
<SOS> `` tomorrow evening , at five o'clock . '' <EOS>	79.3082378489241
<SOS> `` in that case i must say adieu to you , as i am compelled to go to naples , and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning . <EOS>	77.43924654353317

<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	75.57380105263063

<SOS> `` i fear i shall not have that honor . '' <EOS>	58.937385696449475
<SOS> `` well , since we must part , '' said the count , holding out a hand to each of the young men , `` allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey . '' <EOS>	79.34535590985452
<SOS> it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him , and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch , for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse . <EOS>	96.96995581850663

<SOS> `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	66.70450878516641
<SOS> asked albert of franz , when they had returned to their own apartments ; `` you seem more than commonly thoughtful . '' <EOS>	54.19412085971631
<SOS> `` i will confess to you , albert , '' replied franz , `` the count is a very singular person , and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions . '' <EOS>	78.75536132968536

<SOS> `` then listen to me . '' <EOS>	40.700727217767295
<SOS> franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there , and the two corsican bandits with them . <EOS>	56.18495342159155
<SOS> he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count , and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights . <EOS>	71.37825307406989
<SOS> he recounted , with circumstantial exactitude , all the particulars of the supper , the hashish , the statues , the dream , and how , at his awakening , there remained no proof or trace of all these events , save the small yacht , seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio . <EOS>	96.03457581523243
<SOS> then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum , between the count and vampa , in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino , an engagement which , as our readers are aware , he most faithfully fulfilled . <EOS>	90.6535585532109
<SOS> at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night , and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required , and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed . <EOS>	59.876326736776484
<SOS> albert listened with the most profound attention . <EOS>	67.91466836645853
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , when franz had concluded , `` what do you find to object to in all you have related ? <EOS>	50.07996474018907
<SOS> the count is fond of travelling , and , being rich , possesses a vessel of his own . <EOS>	107.74192011976439
<SOS> go but to portsmouth or southampton , and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense , and have the same liking for this amusement . <EOS>	105.71457596112722
<SOS> now , by way of having a resting place during his excursions , avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months , while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years , and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber , monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him ; but , to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace , and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital , he has wisely enough purchased the island , and taken its name . <EOS>	85.85038068320229
<SOS> just ask yourself , my good fellow , whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of ? '' <EOS>	64.21374053745932
<SOS> `` but , '' said franz , `` the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel ? '' <EOS>	81.92380373335158
<SOS> `` why , really the thing seems to me simple enough . <EOS>	54.58134070762483
<SOS> nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves , but purely and simply fugitives , driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village , and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma ; for my own part , i protest that , should i ever go to corsica , my first visit , ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect , should be to the bandits of colomba , if i could only manage to find them ; for , on my conscience , they are a race of men i admire greatly . '' <EOS>	63.91084910111352
<SOS> `` still , '' persisted franz , `` i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains , who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person . <EOS>	88.4151036589389
<SOS> how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians ? '' <EOS>	85.54728573943876
<SOS> `` my good friend , as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence , it would ill become me to search too closely into its source ; therefore , instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws , you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection ; not altogether for preserving my life , for my own idea was that it never was in much danger , but certainly for saving me < num > , < num > piastres , which , being translated , means neither more nor less than < num > , < num > livres of our money a sum at which , most assuredly , i should never have been estimated in france , proving most indisputably , '' added albert with a laugh , `` that no prophet is honored in his own country . '' <EOS>	70.88481025238916
<SOS> `` talking of countries , '' replied franz , `` of what country is the count , what is his native tongue , whence does he derive his immense fortune , and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy ? <EOS>	82.98297223942794
<SOS> certainly these are questions that , in your place , i should like to have answered . '' <EOS>	102.75546435961064
<SOS> `` my dear franz , '' replied albert , `` when , upon receipt of my letter , you found the necessity of asking the count 's assistance , you promptly went to him , saying , 'my friend albert de morcerf is in danger ; help me to deliver him . ' <EOS>	96.35109959004102
<SOS> was not that nearly what you said ? '' <EOS>	67.76189660814086
<SOS> < num > m `` it was . '' <EOS>	75.62269446322081
<SOS> `` well , then , did he ask you , 'who is m. albert de morcerf ? <EOS>	58.87349871514313

<SOS> of what country is he a native ? ' <EOS>	73.65024821745759
<SOS> tell me , did he put all these questions to you ? '' <EOS>	54.815925534410525
<SOS> `` i confess he asked me none . '' <EOS>	72.73084085769615
<SOS> `` no ; he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa , where , i can assure you , in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern , i did not very particularly care to remain . <EOS>	104.61559580428943
<SOS> now , then , franz , when , for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered , he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse ? <EOS>	83.24097270361015
<SOS> my good fellow , you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy . '' <EOS>	55.44428372104164
<SOS> and this time it must be confessed that , contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men , the effective arguments were all on albert 's side . <EOS>	73.51088296887879
<SOS> `` well , '' said franz with a sigh , `` do as you please my dear viscount , for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation . <EOS>	87.95804617884494
<SOS> still , in spite of all , you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage . '' <EOS>	62.83043290219137
<SOS> `` he is a philanthropist , '' answered the other ; `` and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize , given , as you are aware , to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity . <EOS>	44.45454528324245
<SOS> if my vote and interest can obtain it for him , i will readily give him the one and promise the other . <EOS>	106.28360637406148
<SOS> and now , my dear franz , let us talk of something else . <EOS>	82.5122322836453
<SOS> come , shall we take our luncheon , and then pay a last visit to st . <EOS>	62.5078213927539
<SOS> peter 's ? '' <EOS>	74.7752218425012
<SOS> franz silently assented ; and the following afternoon , at half past five o'clock , the young men parted . <EOS>	83.60044474630295
<SOS> albert de morcerf to return to paris , and franz d'épinay to pass a fortnight at venice . <EOS>	98.84384103299097
<SOS> but , ere he entered his travelling carriage , albert , fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into , placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo , on which , beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf , he had written in pencil : `` < num > , rue du helder , on the < num > st may , half past ten a.m. '' chapter < num > . <EOS>	50.561103306282824
<SOS> the guests in the house in the rue du helder , where albert had invited the count of monte cristo , everything was being prepared on the morning of the < num > st of may to do honor to the occasion . <EOS>	65.14541014126706
<SOS> albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court , and directly opposite another building , in which were the servants ' apartments . <EOS>	63.21691971329255
<SOS> two windows only of the pavilion faced the street ; three other windows looked into the court , and two at the back into the garden . <EOS>	79.59965256443938
<SOS> between the court and the garden , built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture , was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf . <EOS>	67.33935146309513
<SOS> a high wall surrounded the whole of the property , surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers , and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron , which served as the carriage entrance . <EOS>	54.60641936998163
<SOS> a small door , close to the lodge of the concierge , gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot . <EOS>	73.79990077975154
<SOS> it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother , unwilling to part from her son , and yet aware that a young man of the viscount 's age required the full exercise of his liberty , had chosen this habitation for albert . <EOS>	57.68832286788513
<SOS> there were not lacking , however , evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent , careless life of an only son , and who lives as it were in a gilded cage . <EOS>	46.437252558897555
<SOS> by means of the two windows looking into the street , albert could see all that passed ; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men , who always want to see the world traverse their horizon , even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare . <EOS>	67.62913572657423
<SOS> then , should anything appear to merit a more minute examination , albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate , similar to that close to the concierge 's door , and which merits a particular description . <EOS>	85.8236080329888
<SOS> it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built , so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt ; but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story . <EOS>	41.05447971932553
<SOS> this door was a mockery to the concierge , from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free , and , like that famous portal in the arabian nights , opening at the `` sesame `` of ali baba , it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world . <EOS>	96.3598387465846
<SOS> at the end of a long corridor , with which the door communicated , and which formed the antechamber , was , on the right , albert 's breakfast room , looking into the court , and on the left the salon , looking into the garden . <EOS>	74.4601283003631
<SOS> shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows , and hid from the garden and court these two apartments , the only rooms into which , as they were on the ground floor , the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate . <EOS>	75.2116167920419
<SOS> on the floor above were similar rooms , with the addition of a third , formed out of the antechamber ; these three rooms were a salon , a boudoir , and a bedroom . <EOS>	102.8127362302622
<SOS> the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan , for the use of smokers . <EOS>	105.21462004080522
<SOS> the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase ; it was evident that every precaution had been taken . <EOS>	49.675058988144784
<SOS> above this floor was a large atelier , which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium , in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence . <EOS>	83.94776390163315
<SOS> there were collected and piled up all albert 's successive caprices , hunting horns , bass viols , flutes a whole orchestra , for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing gloves , broadswords , and single sticks for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , albert de morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy 's education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single stick ; and it was here that he received grisier , cooks , and charles leboucher . <EOS>	62.636901756255426
<SOS> the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets , filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases , lucca della robbia faïences , and palissy platters ; of old armchairs , in which perhaps had sat henry iv . <EOS>	120.69498684026969
<SOS> or sully , louis xiii . <EOS>	62.91235128330865
<SOS> or richelieu for two of these armchairs , adorned with a carved shield , on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field , evidently came from the louvre , or , at least , some royal residence . <EOS>	77.7240056120592
<SOS> over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs , dyed beneath persia 's sun , or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor . <EOS>	98.65077084348547
<SOS> what these stuffs did there , it was impossible to say ; they awaited , while gratifying the eyes , a destination unknown to their owner himself ; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections . <EOS>	77.0601804599157
<SOS> in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet `` baby grand '' piano in rosewood , but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity , and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d'œuvre of beethoven , weber , mozart , haydn , grétry , and porpora . <EOS>	88.82813833491687
<SOS> on the walls , over the doors , on the ceiling , were swords , daggers , malay creeses , maces , battle axes ; gilded , damasked , and inlaid suits of armor ; dried plants , minerals , and stuffed birds , their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight , and their beaks forever open . <EOS>	76.35356950499673
<SOS> this was albert 's favorite lounging place . <EOS>	63.855187556761784
<SOS> however , the morning of the appointment , the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs . <EOS>	65.69192233088826
<SOS> there , on a table , surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan , every species of tobacco known , from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai , and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico , to latakia , was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond ; beside them , in boxes of fragrant wood , were ranged , according to their size and quality , puros , regalias , havanas , and manillas ; and , in an open cabinet , a collection of german pipes , of chibouques , with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral , and of narghiles , with their long tubes of morocco , awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers . <EOS>	80.95067937081751
<SOS> albert had himself presided at the arrangement , or , rather , the symmetrical derangement , which , after coffee , the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths , and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling . <EOS>	67.20445711944816
<SOS> at a quarter to ten , a valet entered ; he composed , with a little groom named john , and who only spoke english , all albert 's establishment , although the cook of the hotel was always at his service , and on great occasions the count 's chasseur also . <EOS>	58.161898515591126
<SOS> this valet , whose name was germain , and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master , held in one hand a number of papers , and in the other a packet of letters , which he gave to albert . <EOS>	65.80765745930815
<SOS> albert glanced carelessly at the different missives , selected two written in a small and delicate hand , and enclosed in scented envelopes , opened them and perused their contents with some attention . <EOS>	45.817332572748846
<SOS> `` how did these letters come ? '' <EOS>	79.53195618257872
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	58.50805565638937
<SOS> `` one by the post , madame danglars ' footman left the other . '' <EOS>	71.27260809909434
<SOS> `` let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box . <EOS>	82.80217551092578

<SOS> take her six bottles of different wine cyprus , sherry , and malaga , and a barrel of ostend oysters ; get them at borel 's , and be sure you say they are for me . '' <EOS>	95.85395242990487

<SOS> `` very well , at half past ten . <EOS>	53.48682234507381
<SOS> debray will , perhaps , be obliged to go to the minister and besides '' ( albert looked at his tablets ) , `` it is the hour i told the count , < num > st may , at half past ten ; and though i do not much rely upon his promise , i wish to be punctual . <EOS>	81.12432315248563

<SOS> `` if you wish , i will inquire . '' <EOS>	96.99451510496264
<SOS> `` yes , ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets , mine is incomplete ; and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o'clock , and that i request permission to introduce someone to her . '' <EOS>	48.12091040094153
<SOS> the valet left the room . <EOS>	111.53885958710528
<SOS> albert threw himself on the divan , tore off the cover of two or three of the papers , looked at the theatre announcements , made a face seeing they gave an opera , and not a ballet ; hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard , and threw down , one after the other , the three leading papers of paris , muttering , `` these papers become more and more stupid every day . '' <EOS>	109.81196744913412
<SOS> a moment after , a carriage stopped before the door , and the servant announced m. lucien debray . <EOS>	40.64396054129702
<SOS> a tall young man , with light hair , clear gray eyes , and thin and compressed lips , dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons , a white neckcloth , and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread , and which , by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles , he fixed in his eye , entered , with a half official air , without smiling or speaking . <EOS>	66.04889755221254
<SOS> `` good morning , lucien , good morning , '' said albert ; `` your punctuality really alarms me . <EOS>	70.41437178244743

<SOS> `` no , my dear fellow , '' returned the young man , seating himself on the divan ; `` reassure yourself ; we are tottering always , but we never fall , and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility , and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us .

<SOS> `` i do not think so , '' added château renaud , with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly . <EOS>	70.85757442715185
<SOS> `` does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	97.29683242638298

<SOS> `` no , but franz has ; for heaven 's sake , not a word of this before him . <EOS>	91.25854692424124
<SOS> franz went in with his eyes blindfolded , and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet . <EOS>	68.56688419588502

<SOS> the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say , `` are you mad , or are you laughing at us ? '' <EOS>	60.907738752561805
<SOS> `` and i also , '' said morrel thoughtfully , `` have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon . '' <EOS>	83.32233969427709

<SOS> `` pardieu ! <EOS>	44.66022157624594
<SOS> everyone exists . '' <EOS>	85.681710218835

<SOS> `` for a man not connected with newspapers , here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel . '' <EOS>	63.05396651708727

<SOS> `` just so , lucien , '' returned morcerf ; `` you have described him feature for feature . <EOS>	66.51995897482657
<SOS> yes , keen and cutting politeness . <EOS>	82.71568065173547
<SOS> this man has often made me shudder ; and one day when we were viewing an execution , i thought i should faint , more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture , than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit . '' <EOS>	71.41977201040605
<SOS> `` did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood ? '' <EOS>	83.40955432374417
<SOS> asked beauchamp . <EOS>	71.74807212919356
<SOS> `` or , having delivered you , make you sign a flaming parchment , surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right ? '' <EOS>	96.05378517178768
<SOS> `` rail on , rail on at your ease , gentlemen , '' said morcerf , somewhat piqued . <EOS>	94.84366835477542
<SOS> `` when i look at you parisians , idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne , and think of this man , it seems to me we are not of the same race . '' <EOS>	40.68483740677742
<SOS> `` i am highly flattered , '' returned beauchamp . <EOS>	74.06657465976446
<SOS> `` at the same time , '' added château renaud , `` your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow , always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti . '' <EOS>	96.71301946501897
<SOS> `` there are no italian banditti , '' said debray . <EOS>	62.164649543743906
<SOS> `` no vampire , '' cried beauchamp . <EOS>	97.37657537052438
<SOS> `` no count of monte cristo '' added debray . <EOS>	92.03818733047129
<SOS> `` there is half past ten striking , albert . '' <EOS>	63.15571061095803
<SOS> < num > m `` confess you have dreamed this , and let us sit down to breakfast , '' continued beauchamp . <EOS>	57.438802775176406
<SOS> but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced , `` his excellency the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	72.3678204268095
<SOS> the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf 's narrative had impressed them , and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion . <EOS>	43.95593362950621
<SOS> he had not heard a carriage stop in the street , or steps in the antechamber ; the door had itself opened noiselessly . <EOS>	66.87869075891132
<SOS> the count appeared , dressed with the greatest simplicity , but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet . <EOS>	49.60508190329326
<SOS> every article of dress hat , coat , gloves , and boots was from the first makers . <EOS>	52.808004897559165
<SOS> he seemed scarcely five and thirty . <EOS>	55.76281431718144
<SOS> but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn . <EOS>	67.92924892908673
<SOS> the count advanced , smiling , into the centre of the room , and approached albert , who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner . <EOS>	71.9831021942515
<SOS> `` punctuality , '' said monte cristo , `` is the politeness of kings , according to one of your sovereigns , i think ; but it is not the same with travellers . <EOS>	41.86414329328685
<SOS> however , i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand ; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble , and especially in france , where , it seems , it is forbidden to beat the postilions . '' <EOS>	97.50355584480408
<SOS> `` my dear count , '' replied albert , `` i was announcing your visit to some of my friends , whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make , and whom i now present to you . <EOS>	58.98804880559105
<SOS> they are the count of château renaud , whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers , and whose ancestors had a place at the round table ; m. lucien debray , private secretary to the minister of the interior ; m. beauchamp , an editor of a paper , and the terror of the french government , but of whom , in spite of his national celebrity , you perhaps have not heard in italy , since his paper is prohibited there ; and m. maximilian morrel , captain of spahis . '' <EOS>	84.59647982257543
<SOS> at this name the count , who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy , but at the same time with coldness and formality , stepped a pace forward , and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks . <EOS>	50.04110504964585
<SOS> `` you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors , monsieur , '' said he ; `` it is a handsome uniform . '' <EOS>	47.18178468543249
<SOS> no one could have said what caused the count 's voice to vibrate so deeply , and what made his eye flash , which was in general so clear , lustrous , and limpid when he pleased . <EOS>	90.1151496873557
<SOS> `` you have never seen our africans , count ? '' <EOS>	81.1617243464617
<SOS> said albert . <EOS>	116.02475293012233
<SOS> `` never , '' replied the count , who was by this time perfectly master of himself again . <EOS>	62.17879112703633
<SOS> `` well , beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army . '' <EOS>	86.95528544834326
<SOS> `` oh , m. de morcerf , '' interrupted morrel . <EOS>	54.80495522381665
<SOS> `` let me go on , captain . <EOS>	90.16745095177804
<SOS> and we have just heard , '' continued albert , `` of a new deed of his , and so heroic a one , that , although i have seen him today for the first time , i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend . '' <EOS>	75.853212107101
<SOS> at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look , changing color , and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion . <EOS>	71.2539317850383
<SOS> `` ah , you have a noble heart , '' said the count ; `` so much the better . '' <EOS>	108.74011055656203
<SOS> this exclamation , which corresponded to the count 's own thought rather than to what albert was saying , surprised everybody , and especially morrel , who looked at monte cristo with wonder . <EOS>	71.63057908414126
<SOS> but , at the same time , the intonation was so soft that , however strange the speech might seem , it was impossible to be offended at it . <EOS>	50.24723604557331
<SOS> < num > m `` why should he doubt it ? '' <EOS>	110.12296200632235
<SOS> said beauchamp to château renaud . <EOS>	79.12304306870419
<SOS> `` in reality , '' replied the latter , who , with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world , had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo , `` albert has not deceived us , for the count is a most singular being . <EOS>	78.21132940999856
<SOS> what say you , morrel ! '' <EOS>	102.5817374931906
<SOS> `` ma foi , he has an open look about him that pleases me , in spite of the singular remark he has made about me . '' <EOS>	74.59061525669618
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said albert , `` germain informs me that breakfast is ready . <EOS>	99.11435465379357
<SOS> my dear count , allow me to show you the way . '' <EOS>	46.48134658303888
<SOS> they passed silently into the breakfast room , and everyone took his place . <EOS>	76.16080751157624
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said the count , seating himself , `` permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit . <EOS>	60.06363617190047
<SOS> i am a stranger , and a stranger to such a degree , that this is the first time i have ever been at paris . <EOS>	46.208657087242415
<SOS> the french way of living is utterly unknown to me , and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs , which are entirely in contrast to the parisian . <EOS>	73.37885829167121
<SOS> i beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish , too italian , or too arabian . <EOS>	41.95279736062404
<SOS> now , then , let us breakfast . '' <EOS>	77.29042074288172
<SOS> `` with what an air he says all this , '' muttered beauchamp ; `` decidedly he is a great man . '' <EOS>	64.90961457617001
<SOS> `` a great man in his own country , '' added debray . <EOS>	67.63671424136957
<SOS> `` a great man in every country , m. debray , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	101.49496811886583
<SOS> the count was , it may be remembered , a most temperate guest . <EOS>	59.4593678469731
<SOS> albert remarked this , expressing his fears lest , at the outset , the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point . <EOS>	55.8609804558971
<SOS> `` my dear count , '' said he , `` i fear one thing , and that is , that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna . <EOS>	54.026404504817016
<SOS> i ought to have consulted you on the point , and have had some dishes prepared expressly . '' <EOS>	70.90556290394956
<SOS> `` did you know me better , '' returned the count , smiling , `` you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself , who has successively lived on macaroni at naples , polenta at milan , olla podrida at valencia , pilau at constantinople , curry in india , and swallows ' nests in china . <EOS>	90.39831448133252
<SOS> i eat everywhere , and of everything , only i eat but little ; and today , that you reproach me with my want of appetite , is my day of appetite , for i have not eaten since yesterday morning . '' <EOS>	43.247594628137854
<SOS> `` what , '' cried all the guests , `` you have not eaten for four and twenty hours ? '' <EOS>	45.78756287338223
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the count ; `` i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes , so that i was somewhat late , and therefore i did not choose to stop . '' <EOS>	66.97868651161495
<SOS> `` and you ate in your carriage ? '' <EOS>	54.10089987441872
<SOS> asked morcerf . <EOS>	56.304380383972784
<SOS> `` no , i slept , as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself , or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat . '' <EOS>	71.39071564874193
<SOS> `` but you can sleep when you please , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	82.81268960158815
<SOS> said morrel . <EOS>	53.26658182035793
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	86.44414488748984
<SOS> `` you have a recipe for it ? '' <EOS>	113.0158162707901
<SOS> `` an infallible one . '' <EOS>	62.5337029503941
<SOS> `` that would be invaluable to us in africa , who have not always any food to eat , and rarely anything to drink . '' <EOS>	79.49502739267025
<SOS> `` yes , '' said monte cristo ; `` but , unfortunately , a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army , which might not awake when it was needed . '' <EOS>	60.8279520495533
<SOS> `` may we inquire what is this recipe ? '' <EOS>	68.45293500020165
<SOS> asked debray . <EOS>	75.10809102008065
<SOS> `` oh , yes , '' returned monte cristo ; `` i make no secret of it . <EOS>	71.34331037161968
<SOS> it is a mixture of excellent opium , which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure , and the best hashish which grows in the east that is , between the tigris and the euphrates . <EOS>	80.28135652148383
<SOS> these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions , and formed into pills . <EOS>	73.77632666017563
<SOS> ten minutes after one is taken , the effect is produced . <EOS>	73.41194967868573
<SOS> ask baron franz d'épinay ; i think he tasted them one day . '' <EOS>	52.31308157871303
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied morcerf , `` he said something about it to me . '' <EOS>	68.32180574009946
<SOS> `` but , '' said beauchamp , who , as became a journalist , was very incredulous , `` you always carry this drug about you ? '' <EOS>	76.90415570533712
<SOS> `` always . '' <EOS>	43.702700526223964
<SOS> `` would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills ? '' <EOS>	89.34818092930108
<SOS> continued beauchamp , hoping to take him at a disadvantage . <EOS>	83.2546420204806
<SOS> `` no , monsieur , '' returned the count ; and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket , formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea . <EOS>	94.83009436220254
<SOS> this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor . <EOS>	87.66011726038793
<SOS> there were four or five more in the emerald , which would contain about a dozen . <EOS>	98.79621133886789
<SOS> the casket passed around the table , but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand . <EOS>	94.72401813058966
<SOS> `` and is it your cook who prepares these pills ? '' <EOS>	72.1817283063004
<SOS> asked beauchamp . <EOS>	49.52053593533685
<SOS> `` oh , no , monsieur , '' replied monte cristo ; `` i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar . <EOS>	94.81645030127535
<SOS> i am a tolerable chemist , and prepare my pills myself . '' <EOS>	98.06376521900269
<SOS> `` this is a magnificent emerald , and the largest i have ever seen , '' said château renaud , `` although my mother has some remarkable family jewels . '' <EOS>	106.38452468747096
<SOS> `` i had three similar ones , '' returned monte cristo . <EOS>	66.05334771004445
<SOS> `` i gave one to the sultan , who mounted it in his sabre ; another to our holy father the pope , who had it set in his tiara , opposite to one nearly as large , though not so fine , given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor , pius vii . <EOS>	57.97674203503857
<SOS> i kept the third for myself , and i had it hollowed out , which reduced its value , but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended . '' <EOS>	48.00132916902483
<SOS> everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment ; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth , or that he was mad . <EOS>	100.5933951748615
<SOS> however , the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief . <EOS>	59.933706663541024
<SOS> `` and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents ? '' <EOS>	103.55705698821947
<SOS> asked debray . <EOS>	123.13121496524718
<SOS> `` the sultan , the liberty of a woman , '' replied the count ; `` the pope , the life of a man ; so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne . '' <EOS>	70.25617450978592
<SOS> `` and it was peppino you saved , was it not ? '' <EOS>	96.72627195507158
<SOS> cried morcerf ; `` it was for him that you obtained pardon ? '' <EOS>	59.33463411342511
<SOS> `` perhaps , '' returned the count , smiling . <EOS>	42.48726102167555
<SOS> `` my dear count , you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus , '' said morcerf . <EOS>	82.4040679450617
<SOS> `` i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights , a wizard of the middle ages ; but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths , when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence . <EOS>	58.233396440082124
<SOS> for example , here is debray who reads , and beauchamp who prints , every day , ' a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard ; ' 'four persons have been assassinated in the rue st. denis ' or 'the faubourg st. germain ; ' 'ten , fifteen , or twenty thieves , have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple , or in the thermes de julien , ' and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma , the campagna di romana , or the pontine marshes . <EOS>	58.643284725061285
<SOS> tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits , and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st. sebastian , instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder . '' <EOS>	62.285562694348904
<SOS> `` ah , '' said monte cristo `` you promised me never to mention that circumstance . '' <EOS>	91.80902167433605
<SOS> `` it was not i who made that promise , '' cried morcerf ; `` it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner , and whom you have forgotten . <EOS>	96.26331514604068
<SOS> pray speak of it , for i shall not only , i trust , relate the little i do know , but also a great deal i do not know . '' <EOS>	83.2104563764569
<SOS> `` it seems to me , '' returned the count , smiling , `` that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened . '' <EOS>	59.86192765703628
<SOS> < num > m `` well , you promise me , if i tell all i know , to relate , in your turn , all that i do not know ? '' <EOS>	109.87280593309343
<SOS> `` that is but fair , '' replied monte cristo . <EOS>	94.314567909177
<SOS> `` well , '' said morcerf , `` for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque , whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa , while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina , and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl . <EOS>	61.228133699123866
<SOS> what i know is , that , like a fool , a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now , i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen , with a beardless chin and slim waist , and who , just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips , placed a pistol to my head , and , aided by seven or eight others , led , or rather dragged me , to the catacombs of st. sebastian , where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar 's commentaries , and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me , that unless the next morning , before six o'clock , four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker 's , at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist . <EOS>	42.71588959135317
<SOS> the letter is still to be seen , for it is in franz d'épinay 's possession , signed by me , and with a postscript of m. luigi vampa . <EOS>	70.19782330777352
<SOS> this is all i know , but i know not , count , how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything . <EOS>	54.865389705067386
<SOS> i assure you , franz and i were lost in admiration . '' <EOS>	67.51429046259796
<SOS> `` nothing more simple , '' returned the count . <EOS>	77.14338747924207
<SOS> `` i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years . <EOS>	66.04283088931645
<SOS> when he was quite a child , and only a shepherd , i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way , and he , in order to repay me , gave me a poniard , the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand , and which you may have seen in my collection of arms . <EOS>	91.98048421154404
<SOS> in after years , whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents , which ought to have cemented our friendship , or whether he did not recollect me , he sought to take me , but , on the contrary , it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band . <EOS>	98.60698717012832
<SOS> i might have handed him over to roman justice , which is somewhat expeditious , and which would have been particularly so with him ; but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart . '' <EOS>	70.11201688692114
<SOS> `` with the condition that they should sin no more , '' said beauchamp , laughing . <EOS>	79.73823690205133
<SOS> `` i see they kept their promise . '' <EOS>	41.731094159480996
<SOS> `` no , monsieur , '' returned monte cristo `` upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends . <EOS>	84.82981219115779
<SOS> perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you , who are socialists , and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor , but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me , and which i will even say , generally occupies itself about me only to injure me ; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem , and preserving a neutrality towards them , it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me . '' <EOS>	91.09660580728386
<SOS> `` bravo , '' cried château renaud ; `` you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism . <EOS>	69.40235677719879
<SOS> bravo , count , bravo ! '' <EOS>	95.98963924798959
<SOS> `` it is frank , at least , '' said morrel . <EOS>	91.61686150627844
<SOS> `` but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed . '' <EOS>	61.60483523443087
<SOS> `` how have i deviated from those principles , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	57.5506062972686
<SOS> asked monte cristo , who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity , that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance . <EOS>	70.46305347208356
<SOS> `` why , it seems to me , '' replied morrel , `` that in delivering m. de morcerf , whom you did not know , you did good to your neighbor and to society . '' <EOS>	78.80925566719631
<SOS> `` of which he is the brightest ornament , '' said beauchamp , drinking off a glass of champagne . <EOS>	78.18505984014097
<SOS> `` my dear count , '' cried morcerf , `` you are at fault you , one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist , you are a philanthropist . <EOS>	81.6795088995845
<SOS> ah , you call yourself oriental , a levantine , maltese , indian , chinese ; your family name is monte cristo ; sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation , and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue , or rather the chief defect , of us eccentric parisians , that is , you assume the vices you have not , and conceal the virtues you possess . '' <EOS>	87.82690561143622
<SOS> `` my dear vicomte , '' returned monte cristo , `` i do not see , in all i have done , anything that merits , either from you or these gentlemen , the pretended eulogies i have received . <EOS>	88.96144339941182
<SOS> you were no stranger to me , for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you , invited you to breakfast with me , lent you one of my carriages , witnessed the carnival in your company , and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted . <EOS>	88.30660376778887
<SOS> i will appeal to any of these gentlemen , could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit , as you term him ? <EOS>	57.86660968783685
<SOS> besides , you know , i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france . <EOS>	64.2102064518301
<SOS> you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project , but today you see it was a reality , and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word . '' <EOS>	61.81933098046121
<SOS> `` i will keep it , '' returned morcerf ; `` but i fear that you will be much disappointed , accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons . <EOS>	93.29946964426401
<SOS> amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you ; our chimborazo is mortmartre , our himalaya is mount valérien , our great desert is the plain of grenelle , where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans . <EOS>	79.62490300826974
<SOS> we have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord . <EOS>	109.87812110081614
<SOS> france is so prosaic , and paris so civilized a city , that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five , because i do not include corsica you will not find , then , in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph , or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp . <EOS>	59.82919707270244
<SOS> there is but one service i can render you , and for that i place myself entirely at your orders , that is , to present , or make my friends present , you everywhere ; besides , you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name , and your fortune , and your talent '' ( monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile ) `` you can present yourself everywhere , and be well received . <EOS>	87.22900631022142

<SOS> i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you , as i shared yours at rome i , who do not profess egotism , but am yet egotist par excellence ; for , except myself , these rooms would not hold a shadow more , unless that shadow were feminine . '' <EOS>	67.50077312176086
<SOS> `` ah , '' said the count , `` that is a most conjugal reservation ; i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage . <EOS>	51.97862578456104

<SOS> `` the affair is still in projection . '' <EOS>	63.17296780508388

<SOS> `` no , '' replied morcerf , `` my father is most anxious about it ; and i hope , ere long , to introduce you , if not to my wife , at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugénie danglars . '' <EOS>	65.19107181275686

<SOS> `` yes , '' returned morcerf , `` a baron of a new creation . '' <EOS>	84.26803432155972
<SOS> `` what matter , '' said monte cristo `` if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction ? '' <EOS>	73.23298863625966
<SOS> `` enormous ones , '' answered beauchamp . <EOS>	55.08936668995942
<SOS> `` although in reality a liberal , he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x. , in < num > , who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor ; so that he wears the ribbon , not , as you would think , in his waistcoat pocket , but at his button hole .

<SOS> `` i do not know him , '' returned monte cristo ; `` but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance , for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard & blount , of london , arstein & eskeles of vienna , and thomson & french at rome . '' <EOS>	60.33809025285579
<SOS> as he pronounced the two last names , the count glanced at maximilian morrel . <EOS>	76.10546045302655
<SOS> if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel , he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified . <EOS>	92.47426886358957

<SOS> `` is it that excellent m. bertuccio , who understands hiring windows so well ? '' <EOS>	95.12542931989346
<SOS> `` yes , you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you ; he has been a soldier , a smuggler in fact , everything . <EOS>	72.27189435069555
<SOS> i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife , for instance . '' <EOS>	86.24689195429342
<SOS> `` and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward , '' said debray . <EOS>	88.34630424412751
<SOS> `` of how much does he rob you every year ? '' <EOS>	93.47920089121054
<SOS> `` on my word , '' replied the count , `` not more than another . <EOS>	81.18204666347955
<SOS> i am sure he answers my purpose , knows no impossibility , and so i keep him . '' <EOS>	61.2418984487889
<SOS> `` then , '' continued château renaud , `` since you have an establishment , a steward , and a hotel in the champs élysées , you only want a mistress . '' <EOS>	64.21632869247496
<SOS> albert smiled . <EOS>	84.11519679213771
<SOS> he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count 's box at the argentina and valle theatres . <EOS>	50.41163769717407
<SOS> `` i have something better than that , '' said monte cristo ; `` i have a slave . <EOS>	69.50149860855147
<SOS> you procure your mistresses from the opera , the vaudeville , or the variétés ; i purchased mine at constantinople ; it cost me more , but i have nothing to fear . '' <EOS>	64.92633324075899
<SOS> `` but you forget , '' replied debray , laughing , `` that we are franks by name and franks by nature , as king charles said , and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free . '' <EOS>	44.31354523337818
<SOS> `` who will tell her ? '' <EOS>	52.78539605333025
<SOS> `` the first person who sees her . '' <EOS>	95.26910744282303

<SOS> `` that is different . '' <EOS>	98.42208454863564
<SOS> `` but at least we shall see her , '' said beauchamp , `` or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes ? '' <EOS>	94.3367467271289
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' replied monte cristo ; `` i do not carry brutalism so far . <EOS>	43.411272950757734
<SOS> everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me , and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else ; it is for that reason , perhaps , that they do not quit me . '' <EOS>	61.20893977507579
<SOS> they had long since passed to dessert and cigars . <EOS>	69.56364699352221
<SOS> `` my dear albert , '' said debray , rising , `` it is half past two . <EOS>	55.33046427179425
<SOS> your guest is charming , but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes . <EOS>	52.44950963177091
<SOS> i must return to the minister 's . <EOS>	78.1141405921856
<SOS> i will tell him of the count , and we shall soon know who he is . '' <EOS>	99.76518697194102
<SOS> `` take care , '' returned albert ; `` no one has been able to accomplish that . '' <EOS>	93.24466048588653
<SOS> `` oh , we have three millions for our police ; it is true they are almost always spent beforehand , but , no matter , we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose . '' <EOS>	67.80097169023189

<SOS> gentlemen , good morning . '' <EOS>	73.50681385765022
<SOS> as he left the room , debray called out loudly , `` my carriage . '' <EOS>	58.46927095045517
<SOS> `` bravo , '' said beauchamp to albert ; `` i shall not go to the chamber , but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m . <EOS>	62.892377051863
<SOS> danglars . '' <EOS>	53.093382477235195
<SOS> `` for heaven 's sake , beauchamp , '' returned morcerf , `` do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere . <EOS>	101.79896216364705
<SOS> is he not peculiar ? '' <EOS>	83.99433473280239
<SOS> `` he is more than that , '' replied château renaud ; `` he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life . <EOS>	51.33888368744858
<SOS> are you coming , morrel ? '' <EOS>	92.02692083488257
<SOS> `` directly i have given my card to the count , who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay , no . <EOS>	75.1465264261078
<SOS> < num > . '' <EOS>	70.43680896787191
<SOS> `` be sure i shall not fail to do so , '' returned the count , bowing . <EOS>	68.76603112562292
<SOS> and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud , leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf . <EOS>	53.14217929965792
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	72.26837343164952
<SOS> the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo , `` my dear count , '' said he , `` allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor 's apartment . <EOS>	113.22376239387191
<SOS> you , who are accustomed to the palaces of italy , can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live . <EOS>	47.51060479155769
<SOS> as we pass from one room to another , i will open the windows to let you breathe . '' <EOS>	79.92786565786538
<SOS> monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor . <EOS>	62.053129877709154
<SOS> albert led him first to his atelier , which was , as we have said , his favorite apartment . <EOS>	75.23164651617576
<SOS> monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets , japanese porcelain , oriental stuffs , venetian glass , arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him ; and at the first glance he recognized their date , their country , and their origin . <EOS>	52.271425361727125
<SOS> morcerf had expected he should be the guide ; on the contrary , it was he who , under the count 's guidance , followed a course of archæology , mineralogy , and natural history . <EOS>	74.8999713167751
<SOS> they descended to the first floor ; albert led his guest into the salon . <EOS>	49.66490716899199
<SOS> the salon was filled with the works of modern artists ; there were landscapes by dupré , with their long reeds and tall trees , their lowing oxen and marvellous skies ; delacroix 's arabian cavaliers , with their long white burnouses , their shining belts , their damasked arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces ; aquarelles of boulanger , representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet ; there were paintings by diaz , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his suns more brilliant than the sun ; designs by decamp , as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa , but more poetic ; pastels by giraud and müller , representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; sketches torn from the album of dauzats ' `` travels in the east , '' that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel , or beneath the dome of a mosque in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past . <EOS>	84.24375992359003
<SOS> albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller , but , to his great surprise , the latter , without seeking for the signatures , many of which , indeed , were only initials , named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him , but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him . <EOS>	72.77926114431975
<SOS> from the salon they passed into the bedchamber ; it was a model of taste and simple elegance . <EOS>	58.17535332306405
<SOS> a single portrait , signed by léopold robert , shone in its carved and gilded frame . <EOS>	73.22528275953724
<SOS> this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo 's attention , for he made three rapid steps in the chamber , and stopped suddenly before it . <EOS>	69.2225696390137
<SOS> it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty , with a dark complexion , and light and lustrous eyes , veiled beneath long lashes . <EOS>	60.24224718804904
<SOS> she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen , a red and black bodice , and golden pins in her hair . <EOS>	90.36406090598562
<SOS> she was looking at the sea , and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky . <EOS>	47.68890220832696
<SOS> the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count 's visage , or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders . <EOS>	76.54326456849061
<SOS> silence prevailed for an instant , during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture . <EOS>	98.1177454402896
<SOS> `` you have there a most charming mistress , viscount , '' said the count in a perfectly calm tone ; `` and this costume a ball costume , doubtless becomes her admirably . '' <EOS>	77.09879786791701
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur , '' returned albert , `` i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this . <EOS>	79.34625626824626
<SOS> you do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here . <EOS>	69.31184526218614
<SOS> she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago . <EOS>	98.09707689735762
<SOS> this costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in < num > . <EOS>	74.76383669775089
<SOS> the countess had this portrait painted during the count 's absence . <EOS>	102.26597175351814
<SOS> she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of léopold robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . <EOS>	88.49802242153973
<SOS> it is true , between ourselves , that m. de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most mediocre amateur of art . <EOS>	91.91505587318746
<SOS> it is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease m. de morcerf , whose portrait , by gros , i will also show you . <EOS>	82.37967677020937
<SOS> excuse my talking of family matters , but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . <EOS>	74.15912221431292
<SOS> the picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping . <EOS>	85.86452759951767
<SOS> this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . '' <EOS>	50.82277352570072
<SOS> < num > m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert , as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words , but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart . <EOS>	86.45675916696719
<SOS> `` now , '' said albert , `` that you have seen all my treasures , allow me to offer them to you , unworthy as they are . <EOS>	58.82783170119886
<SOS> consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of m. de morcerf , he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom i announced your promised visit , and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person . <EOS>	71.7633323710661
<SOS> you are somewhat blasé i know , and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor , who has seen so many others . <EOS>	42.89488244810806
<SOS> however , accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions . '' <EOS>	83.22831743422033
<SOS> monte cristo bowed without making any answer ; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty . <EOS>	92.79960528506224
<SOS> albert summoned his servant , and ordered him to acquaint m. and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo . <EOS>	65.76590677242847
<SOS> albert followed him with the count . <EOS>	62.17821437204473
<SOS> when they arrived at the antechamber , above the door was visible a shield , which , by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture , indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon . <EOS>	80.92253408058116
<SOS> monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively . <EOS>	98.56774539852253
<SOS> `` azure seven merlets , or , placed bender , '' said he . <EOS>	72.72625898726024
<SOS> `` these are , doubtless , your family arms ? <EOS>	55.780266875047815
<SOS> except the knowledge of blazons , that enables me to decipher them , i am very ignorant of heraldry i , a count of a fresh creation , fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st. stephen , and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary . <EOS>	102.5922104408012
<SOS> besides , you must have something on the panels of your carriage , to escape being searched by the custom house officers . <EOS>	58.41583585734321
<SOS> excuse my putting such a question to you . '' <EOS>	91.77485796483262
<SOS> `` it is not indiscreet , '' returned morcerf , with the simplicity of conviction . <EOS>	63.78185427899915
<SOS> `` you have guessed rightly . <EOS>	85.55924492309087
<SOS> these are our arms , that is , those of my father , but they are , as you see , joined to another shield , which has gules , a silver tower , which are my mother 's . <EOS>	45.4572729578957
<SOS> by her side i am spanish , but the family of morcerf is french , and , i have heard , one of the oldest of the south of france . '' <EOS>	75.09465560511546
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied monte cristo `` these blazons prove that . <EOS>	48.79035690971752
<SOS> almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross , in honor of their mission , or birds of passage , in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake , and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith . <EOS>	42.7101459705547
<SOS> one of your ancestors had joined the crusades , and supposing it to be only that of st. louis , that makes you mount to the thirteenth century , which is tolerably ancient . '' <EOS>	70.79807315065838
<SOS> `` it is possible , '' said morcerf ; `` my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that , and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d'hozier and jaucourt . <EOS>	51.92363849973471
<SOS> at present i no longer think of it , and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government . '' <EOS>	43.479935576035665
<SOS> `` well , then , your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments , and which have no heraldic meaning whatever . <EOS>	42.40352228954126
<SOS> as for you , viscount , '' continued monte cristo to morcerf , `` you are more fortunate than the government , for your arms are really beautiful , and speak to the imagination . <EOS>	54.80064514207339
<SOS> yes , you are at once from provence and spain ; that explains , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan . '' <EOS>	97.08157825071639
<SOS> it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness . <EOS>	62.63684721986849
<SOS> morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon . <EOS>	80.80523117750325
<SOS> in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait . <EOS>	72.85719808649513
<SOS> it was that of a man , from five to eight and thirty , in the uniform of a general officer , wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion , that indicates superior rank , the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck , which showed he was a commander , and on the right breast , the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour , and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii. , which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain , or , what was just the same thing as regarded decorations , had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries . <EOS>	56.06256416551
<SOS> monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other , when another door opened , and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person . <EOS>	42.136334618461326
<SOS> he was a man of forty to forty five years , but he seemed at least fifty , and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair , which was cut short , in the military fashion . <EOS>	90.0406067187127
<SOS> he was dressed in plain clothes , and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged . <EOS>	48.60594923062088
<SOS> he entered with a tolerably dignified step , and some little haste . <EOS>	45.02579775107774
<SOS> monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step . <EOS>	87.59436511949788
<SOS> it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground , and his eyes on the count of morcerf . <EOS>	65.45822050012092
<SOS> `` father , '' said the young man , `` i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo , the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you . '' <EOS>	55.2296183966431
<SOS> `` you are most welcome , monsieur , '' said the count of morcerf , saluting monte cristo with a smile , `` and monsieur has rendered our house , in preserving its only heir , a service which insures him our eternal gratitude . '' <EOS>	92.01730670294171
<SOS> as he said these words , the count of morcerf pointed to a chair , while he seated himself in another opposite the window . <EOS>	113.76725402587968
<SOS> monte cristo , in taking the seat morcerf offered him , placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains , and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there . <EOS>	67.20105598746422
<SOS> `` the countess , '' said morcerf , `` was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive . <EOS>	99.56123665808703
<SOS> she will , however , be in the salon in ten minutes . '' <EOS>	66.65430810745313
<SOS> `` it is a great honor to me , '' returned monte cristo , `` to be thus , on the first day of my arrival in paris , brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation , and to whom fortune has for once been equitable , but has she not still on the plains of mitidja , or in the mountains of atlas , a marshal 's staff to offer you ? '' <EOS>	72.04471364776943
<SOS> `` oh , '' replied morcerf , reddening slightly , `` i have left the service , monsieur . <EOS>	84.44561973320168
<SOS> made a peer at the restoration , i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont . <EOS>	88.51767775373214
<SOS> i could , therefore , expect a higher rank , and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne ? <EOS>	110.98902778434787
<SOS> but the revolution of july was , it seems , sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful , and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period . <EOS>	65.83239731323792
<SOS> i tendered my resignation , for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field , you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons . <EOS>	100.49814072941517
<SOS> i have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics . <EOS>	73.94307672827743
<SOS> i have devoted myself to industry ; i study the useful arts . <EOS>	61.2424658283463
<SOS> during the twenty years i served , i often wished to do so , but i had not the time . '' <EOS>	89.74555372240019
<SOS> `` these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other , '' returned monte cristo . <EOS>	50.953081541143995
<SOS> `` a gentleman of high birth , possessor of an ample fortune , you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier , step by step this is uncommon ; then become general , peer of france , commander of the legion of honor , you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship , without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures ; this , indeed , is praiseworthy , nay , more , it is sublime . '' <EOS>	64.29201005521699
<SOS> < num > m albert looked on and listened with astonishment ; he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm . <EOS>	63.280392430307664
<SOS> `` alas , '' continued the stranger , doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf 's brow , `` we do not act thus in italy ; we grow according to our race and our species , and we pursue the same lines , and often the same uselessness , all our lives . '' <EOS>	45.992206759218504
<SOS> `` but , monsieur , '' said the count of morcerf , `` for a man of your merit , italy is not a country , and france opens her arms to receive you ; respond to her call . <EOS>	67.70644680689136
<SOS> france will not , perhaps , be always ungrateful . <EOS>	108.6640965222564
<SOS> she treats her children ill , but she always welcomes strangers . '' <EOS>	61.53336766573519
<SOS> `` ah , father , '' said albert with a smile , `` it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo ; he despises all honors , and contents himself with those written on his passport . '' <EOS>	74.80484434203896
<SOS> `` that is the most just remark , '' replied the stranger , `` i ever heard made concerning myself . '' <EOS>	73.57665679058168
<SOS> `` you have been free to choose your career , '' observed the count of morcerf , with a sigh ; `` and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers . '' <EOS>	46.72418975818637
<SOS> `` precisely , monsieur , '' replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze . <EOS>	101.38919797152096
<SOS> `` if i did not fear to fatigue you , '' said the general , evidently charmed with the count 's manners , `` i would have taken you to the chamber ; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators . '' <EOS>	56.579247179993025
<SOS> `` i shall be most grateful , monsieur , if you will , at some future time , renew your offer , but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess , and i will therefore wait . '' <EOS>	115.92553824387495
<SOS> `` ah , here is my mother , '' cried the viscount . <EOS>	120.99308948156805
<SOS> monte cristo , turned round hastily , and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon , at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered , pale and motionless ; when monte cristo turned round , she let fall her arm , which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door post . <EOS>	65.33361554942064
<SOS> she had been there some moments , and had heard the last words of the visitor . <EOS>	101.36384246714309
<SOS> the latter rose and bowed to the countess , who inclined herself without speaking . <EOS>	49.53811977207074
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	76.91852607537898
<SOS> good heavens , madame , '' said the count , `` are you ill , or is it the heat of the room that affects you ? '' <EOS>	73.80798991194992
<SOS> `` are you ill , mother ? '' <EOS>	87.34389321959357
<SOS> cried the viscount , springing towards her . <EOS>	56.55637324291569
<SOS> she thanked them both with a smile . <EOS>	59.10251286470601
<SOS> `` no , '' returned she , `` but i feel some emotion on seeing , for the first time , the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation . <EOS>	81.76527333042766
<SOS> monsieur , '' continued the countess , advancing with the majesty of a queen , `` i owe to you the life of my son , and for this i bless you . <EOS>	72.00328217084166
<SOS> now , i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you , from the bottom of my heart . '' <EOS>	61.04428348197924
<SOS> the count bowed again , but lower than before ; he was even paler than mercédès . <EOS>	108.00722976300742
<SOS> `` madame , '' said he , `` the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action . <EOS>	66.93950878324402
<SOS> to save a man , to spare a father 's feelings , or a mother 's sensibility , is not to do a good action , but a simple deed of humanity . '' <EOS>	75.07437676668732
<SOS> at these words , uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness , madame de morcerf replied : `` it is very fortunate for my son , monsieur , that he found such a friend , and i thank god that things are thus . '' <EOS>	84.58769494920533
<SOS> and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude , that the count fancied he saw tears in them . <EOS>	64.77320204561177
<SOS> m. de morcerf approached her . <EOS>	47.09931173564515
<SOS> `` madame , '' said he . <EOS>	73.57532900305745
<SOS> `` i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him , and i pray you to do so also . <EOS>	78.9435059725187
<SOS> the sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and i am to speak . '' <EOS>	73.10858504357005
<SOS> `` go , then , and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence , '' replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling . <EOS>	65.97881793230792
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' continued she , turning to monte cristo , `` will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us ? '' <EOS>	107.14134243407949
<SOS> `` believe me , madame , i feel most grateful for your kindness , but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning , and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris , which i scarcely know ; this is but a trifling inquietude , i know , but one that may be appreciated . '' <EOS>	80.4890052499333
<SOS> `` we shall have the pleasure another time , '' said the countess ; `` you promise that ? '' <EOS>	85.31292063881068
<SOS> monte cristo inclined himself without answering , but the gesture might pass for assent . <EOS>	56.894560794106184
<SOS> `` i will not detain you , monsieur , '' continued the countess ; `` i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate . '' <EOS>	66.28284486949441
<SOS> `` my dear count , '' said albert , `` i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome , and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready . '' <EOS>	53.509244548465965
<SOS> `` a thousand thanks for your kindness , viscount , '' returned the count of monte cristo `` but i suppose that m. bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him , and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door . '' <EOS>	59.89728671207415
<SOS> albert was used to the count 's manner of proceeding ; he knew that , like nero , he was in search of the impossible , and nothing astonished him , but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count 's orders had been executed , he accompanied him to the door of the house . <EOS>	85.09263243434992
<SOS> monte cristo was not deceived . <EOS>	108.41546374542978
<SOS> as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf 's antechamber , a footman , the same who at rome had brought the count 's card to the two young men , and announced his visit , sprang into the vestibule , and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him . <EOS>	82.33716667698785
<SOS> it was a coupé of koller 's building , and with horses and harness for which drake had , to the knowledge of all the lions of paris , refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas . <EOS>	78.240979324728
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' said the count to albert , `` i do not ask you to accompany me to my house , as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry , and i have , as you know , a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise . <EOS>	62.47740682815218
<SOS> give me , therefore , one more day before i invite you ; i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality . '' <EOS>	76.57430864275608
<SOS> `` if you ask me for a day , count , i know what to anticipate ; it will not be a house i shall see , but a palace . <EOS>	87.22269498998654
<SOS> you have decidedly some genius at your control . '' <EOS>	76.81192820351713
<SOS> `` ma foi , spread that idea , '' replied the count of monte cristo , putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage , `` and that will be worth something to me among the ladies . '' <EOS>	74.0776190593352
<SOS> as he spoke , he sprang into the vehicle , the door was closed , but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf . <EOS>	76.3779720245119
<SOS> when albert returned to his mother , he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair , the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle , fastened here and there to the drapery , and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures , showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom . <EOS>	72.82845791953231
<SOS> albert could not see the face of the countess , as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head , and which fell over her features in misty folds , but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered . <EOS>	65.58914280725723
<SOS> he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands , the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts , and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess 's smelling bottle , taken from its shagreen case , and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness , as he entered : `` my dear mother , have you been ill during my absence ? '' <EOS>	102.19210429284945
<SOS> `` no , no , albert , but you know these roses , tuberoses , and orange flowers throw out at first , before one is used to them , such violent perfumes . '' <EOS>	88.27576376922957
<SOS> `` then , my dear mother , '' said albert , putting his hand to the bell , `` they must be taken into the antechamber . <EOS>	92.34363793079287
<SOS> you are really ill , and just now were so pale as you came into the room `` `` was i pale , albert ? '' <EOS>	93.77232216154039
<SOS> `` yes ; a pallor that suits you admirably , mother , but which did not the less alarm my father and myself . '' <EOS>	101.9068806392035
<SOS> `` did your father speak of it ? '' <EOS>	64.84232366993997
<SOS> inquired mercédès eagerly . <EOS>	59.67765902610399
<SOS> `` no , madame ; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you ? '' <EOS>	53.31715158439072
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , i do remember , '' replied the countess . <EOS>	71.10664683330234
<SOS> a servant entered , summoned by albert 's ring of the bell . <EOS>	43.71894178917521
<SOS> `` take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room , '' said the viscount ; `` they make the countess ill. '' the footman obeyed his orders . <EOS>	56.944087958456834
<SOS> a long pause ensued , which lasted until all the flowers were removed . <EOS>	72.50515187597792
<SOS> `` what is this name of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	49.0773135724406
<SOS> inquired the countess , when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers , `` is it a family name , or the name of the estate , or a simple title ? '' <EOS>	99.58646418597947
<SOS> `` i believe , mother , it is merely a title . <EOS>	87.15980921281347
<SOS> the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago , and , as he told you today , has founded a commandery . <EOS>	90.21414325770024
<SOS> you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence , saint george constantinian of parma , and even for the order of malta . <EOS>	74.20787587133336
<SOS> except this , he has no pretension to nobility , and calls himself a chance count , although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction . '' <EOS>	77.84720926743967
<SOS> `` his manners are admirable , '' said the countess , `` at least , as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here . '' <EOS>	96.86761475210092
<SOS> `` they are perfect mother , so perfect , that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english , the spanish , and the german . '' <EOS>	63.663401562389105
<SOS> the countess paused a moment ; then , after a slight hesitation , she resumed . <EOS>	78.99421234573535
<SOS> `` you have seen , my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m. de monte cristo in his house , you are quicksighted , have much knowledge of the world , more tact than is usual at your age , do you think the count is really what he appears to be ? '' <EOS>	86.57848649957583
<SOS> `` what does he appear to be ? '' <EOS>	79.05978099262944
<SOS> `` why , you have just said , a man of high distinction . '' <EOS>	85.07570854638264
<SOS> `` i told you , my dear mother , he was esteemed such . '' <EOS>	96.80097319008873
<SOS> `` but what is your own opinion , albert ? '' <EOS>	100.42184467397254
<SOS> `` i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him , but i think him a maltese . '' <EOS>	93.78565052568767
<SOS> `` i do not ask you of his origin but what he is . '' <EOS>	47.91370393246764
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	66.11964660776601
<SOS> what he is ; that is quite another thing . <EOS>	70.6677703235976
<SOS> i have seen so many remarkable things in him , that if you would have me really say what i think , i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron 's heroes , whom misery has marked with a fatal brand ; some manfred , some lara , some werner , one of those wrecks , as it were , of some ancient family , who , disinherited of their patrimony , have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius , which has placed them above the laws of society . '' <EOS>	55.62235960805316
<SOS> `` you say `` `` i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean , without inhabitants or garrison , the resort of smugglers of all nations , and pirates of every flag . <EOS>	56.47084837673896
<SOS> who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection ? '' <EOS>	69.38929380711708
<SOS> `` that is possible , '' said the countess , reflecting . <EOS>	85.50461385090928
<SOS> `` never mind , '' continued the young man , `` smuggler or not , you must agree , mother dear , as you have seen him , that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man , who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris . <EOS>	62.139045508813126
<SOS> why , this very morning , in my rooms , he made his entrée amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement , not even excepting château renaud . '' <EOS>	51.90379577325023
<SOS> `` and what do you suppose is the count 's age ? '' <EOS>	109.40173093887732
<SOS> inquired mercédès , evidently attaching great importance to this question . <EOS>	93.70449439709456
<SOS> `` thirty five or thirty six , mother . '' <EOS>	90.82427822950099
<SOS> `` so young , it is impossible , '' said mercédès , replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection . <EOS>	72.45261087667512
<SOS> `` it is the truth , however . <EOS>	47.7577477997234
<SOS> three or four times he has said to me , and certainly without the slightest premeditation , 'at such a period i was five years old , at another ten years old , at another twelve , ' and i , induced by curiosity , which kept me alive to these details , have compared the dates , and never found him inaccurate . <EOS>	74.74053541374377
<SOS> the age of this singular man , who is of no age , is then , i am certain , thirty five . <EOS>	56.73553104168467
<SOS> besides , mother , remark how vivid his eye , how raven black his hair , and his brow , though so pale , is free from wrinkles , he is not only vigorous , but also young . '' <EOS>	115.3111356011698
<SOS> the countess bent her head , as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts . <EOS>	71.91880972834274
<SOS> `` and has this man displayed a friendship for you , albert ? '' <EOS>	65.55273358562103
<SOS> she asked with a nervous shudder . <EOS>	95.61787272618645
<SOS> `` i am inclined to think so . '' <EOS>	82.60777306223048
<SOS> `` and do you like him ? '' <EOS>	90.74389727147314
<SOS> `` why , he pleases me in spite of franz d'épinay , who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world . '' <EOS>	86.88642811872216
<SOS> the countess shuddered . <EOS>	70.25777757119111
<SOS> `` albert , '' she said , in a voice which was altered by emotion , `` i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances . <EOS>	82.67216495452321
<SOS> now you are a man , and are able to give me advice ; yet i repeat to you , albert , be prudent . '' <EOS>	121.31910997716918
<SOS> `` why , my dear mother , it is necessary , in order to make your advice turn to account , that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust . <EOS>	112.24114627516359
<SOS> the count never plays , he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry , and is so rich that he can not , without intending to laugh at me , try to borrow money . <EOS>	94.70021265570182
<SOS> what , then , have i to fear from him ? '' <EOS>	64.80827320071653
<SOS> `` you are right , '' said the countess , `` and my fears are weakness , especially when directed against a man who has saved your life . <EOS>	70.29346106979116
<SOS> how did your father receive him , albert ? <EOS>	83.90498141324346
<SOS> it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count . <EOS>	55.21245112452627
<SOS> m. de morcerf is sometimes occupied , his business makes him reflective , and he might , without intending it `` `` nothing could be in better taste than my father 's demeanor , madame , '' said albert ; `` nay , more , he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years . <EOS>	57.579955140331634
<SOS> each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father , '' added albert with a laugh . <EOS>	56.625857744788064
<SOS> `` and thus they parted the best possible friends , and m. de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers . '' <EOS>	77.96678314475756
<SOS> the countess made no reply . <EOS>	69.66053959100866
<SOS> she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed . <EOS>	50.00866288995932
<SOS> the young man , standing up before her , gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome . <EOS>	84.73753599964883
<SOS> then , after seeing her eyes closed , and hearing her breathe gently , he believed she had dropped asleep , and left the apartment on tiptoe , closing the door after him with the utmost precaution . <EOS>	64.783790218888
<SOS> `` this devil of a fellow , '' he muttered , shaking his head ; `` i said at the time he would create a sensation here , and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer . <EOS>	64.98107343019802
<SOS> my mother has noticed him , and he must therefore , perforce , be remarkable . '' <EOS>	84.421209204368
<SOS> he went down to the stables , not without some slight annoyance , when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a `` turnout '' which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs . <EOS>	55.65382574965892

<SOS> monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house ; it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance , but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves , to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give < num > , < num > francs apiece for his horses . <EOS>	85.23610822969015
<SOS> the house ali had chosen , and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo , was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs élysées . <EOS>	70.5225439627776
<SOS> a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre , and masked a portion of the front ; around this shrubbery two alleys , like two arms , extended right and left , and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico , on every step of which stood a porcelain vase , filled with flowers . <EOS>	73.70400294076762
<SOS> this house , isolated from the rest , had , besides the main entrance , another in the rue de ponthieu . <EOS>	49.34233875935422
<SOS> even before the coachman had hailed the concierge , the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming , and at paris , as everywhere else , he was served with the rapidity of lightning . <EOS>	67.32739556719085
<SOS> the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed , and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel . <EOS>	68.11430320610995
<SOS> the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico , two men presented themselves at the carriage window ; the one was ali , who , smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy , seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo . <EOS>	75.24066460101102
<SOS> the other bowed respectfully , and offered his arm to assist the count in descending . <EOS>	58.821942204718106
<SOS> `` thanks , m. bertuccio , '' said the count , springing lightly up the three steps of the portico ; `` and the notary ? '' <EOS>	77.07351268988837
<SOS> `` he is in the small salon , excellency , '' returned bertuccio . <EOS>	89.34077901294317

<SOS> monte cristo gave his hat , cane , and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerf 's , and then he passed into the small salon , preceded by bertuccio , who showed him the way . <EOS>	105.5107901963163
<SOS> `` these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	44.76267872110594

<SOS> as the steward had said , the notary awaited him in the small salon . <EOS>	60.41528671321903
<SOS> he was a simple looking lawyer 's clerk , elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener . <EOS>	89.00456847020837

<SOS> `` very well ; and where is this house that i purchase ? '' <EOS>	66.80955850300529
<SOS> asked the count carelessly , addressing himself half to bertuccio , half to the notary . <EOS>	90.28112923377422
<SOS> the steward made a gesture that signified , `` i do not know . '' <EOS>	76.44267715991207
<SOS> the notary looked at the count with astonishment . <EOS>	51.38073289116704

<SOS> said he , `` does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated ? '' <EOS>	57.898508497981815

<SOS> `` bertuccio , '' said he , `` give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur . '' <EOS>	63.837132197930416
<SOS> the steward left the room with a faltering step , and returned with a bundle of bank notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there . <EOS>	65.97032034659182
<SOS> `` and now , '' demanded the count , `` are all the forms complied with ? '' <EOS>	89.07892905384965

<SOS> `` but , '' observed the honest notary , `` the count is , i think , mistaken ; it is only fifty thousand francs , everything included . '' <EOS>	112.60107217948016

<SOS> `` well , then , it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble , '' said the count ; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal . <EOS>	90.03613227802235
<SOS> the notary left the room backwards , and bowing down to the ground ; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client . <EOS>	77.12641823918393
<SOS> `` see this gentleman out , '' said the count to bertuccio . <EOS>	111.77197478933421
<SOS> and the steward followed the notary out of the room . <EOS>	55.61643113381136
<SOS> scarcely was the count alone , when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock , and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck , and which never left him . <EOS>	57.06175922320669
<SOS> after having sought for a few minutes , he stopped at a leaf which had several notes , and compared them with the deed of sale , which lay on the table , and recalling his souvenirs `` 'auteuil , rue de la fontaine , no . <EOS>	94.56793331433047
<SOS> < num > ; ' it is indeed the same , '' said he ; `` and now , am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror ? <EOS>	68.0469108735208

<SOS> `` bertuccio ! '' <EOS>	70.40168666231162
<SOS> the steward appeared at the door . <EOS>	67.34351896074628

<SOS> `` you know the environs of paris , then ? '' <EOS>	63.38653811712552
<SOS> `` no , excellency , no , '' returned the steward , with a sort of nervous trembling , which monte cristo , a connoisseur in all emotions , rightly attributed to great disquietude . <EOS>	66.84757105157388
<SOS> `` it is unfortunate , '' returned he , `` that you have never visited the environs , for i wish to see my new property this evening , and had you gone with me , you could have given me some useful information . '' <EOS>	59.690091311044746
<SOS> `` to auteuil ! '' <EOS>	40.702920196746035
<SOS> cried bertuccio , whose copper complexion became livid `` i go to auteuil ? '' <EOS>	82.17616451666937
<SOS> `` well , what is there surprising in that ? <EOS>	88.72518590907137
<SOS> when i live at auteuil , you must come there , as you belong to my service . '' <EOS>	67.82446886799893
<SOS> bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master , and remained motionless , without making any answer . <EOS>	66.46828600646961
<SOS> `` why , what has happened to you ? <EOS>	115.1515491879315
<SOS> are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage ? '' <EOS>	64.18268106986547
<SOS> asked monte cristo , in the same tone that louis xiv . <EOS>	90.80678245091116
<SOS> pronounced the famous , `` i have been almost obliged to wait . '' <EOS>	47.24640428707127
<SOS> bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber , and cried in a hoarse voice : `` his excellency 's horses ! '' <EOS>	107.18163021834249
<SOS> monte cristo wrote two or three notes , and , as he sealed the last , the steward appeared . <EOS>	45.664080702568555
<SOS> `` your excellency 's carriage is at the door , '' said he . <EOS>	65.25515154814906
<SOS> `` well , take your hat and gloves , '' returned monte cristo . <EOS>	56.418573974971146
<SOS> `` am i to accompany you , your excellency ? '' <EOS>	48.49407257825038
<SOS> cried bertuccio . <EOS>	60.63530713700316
<SOS> `` certainly , you must give the orders , for i intend residing at the house . '' <EOS>	119.18478480832454
<SOS> < num > m it was unexampled for a servant of the count 's to dare to dispute an order of his , so the steward , without saying a word , followed his master , who got into the carriage , and signed to him to follow , which he did , taking his place respectfully on the front seat . <EOS>	82.91373241022866
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	66.20964466168259
<SOS> the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed , as they descended the staircase , that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner ; that is , had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb , and as he seated himself in the carriage , muttered a short prayer . <EOS>	80.5807748523833
<SOS> anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward 's extraordinary repugnance for the count 's projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey . <EOS>	69.35796734736896
<SOS> in twenty minutes they were at auteuil ; the steward 's emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village . <EOS>	92.63926728824714
<SOS> bertuccio , crouched in the corner of the carriage , began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed . <EOS>	98.14147855640843
<SOS> `` tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine , no . <EOS>	59.516775433903
<SOS> < num > , '' said the count , fixing his eyes on the steward , to whom he gave this order . <EOS>	54.20143193897922
<SOS> bertuccio 's forehead was covered with perspiration ; however , he obeyed , and , leaning out of the window , he cried to the coachman , `` rue de la fontaine , no . <EOS>	58.66625058953821
<SOS> < num > . '' <EOS>	108.8569788214615
<SOS> no . <EOS>	51.70863428303919
<SOS> < num > was situated at the extremity of the village ; during the drive night had set in , and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage . <EOS>	99.28246851118803
<SOS> the carriage stopped , the footman sprang off the box and opened the door . <EOS>	81.47521538645933
<SOS> `` well , '' said the count , `` you do not get out , m. bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage , then ? <EOS>	56.699938770265014
<SOS> what are you thinking of this evening ? '' <EOS>	77.74435265152754
<SOS> bertuccio sprang out , and offered his shoulder to the count , who , this time , leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage . <EOS>	79.35041263635556
<SOS> `` knock , '' said the count , `` and announce me . '' <EOS>	91.39393318367328
<SOS> bertuccio knocked , the door opened , and the concierge appeared . <EOS>	46.98175376271993
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	61.885629900934326
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	44.93820608911047
<SOS> `` it is your new master , my good fellow , '' said the footman . <EOS>	82.06960290327821
<SOS> and he held out to the concierge the notary 's order . <EOS>	107.78525083187736
<SOS> `` the house is sold , then ? '' <EOS>	39.9336247457864
<SOS> demanded the concierge ; `` and this gentleman is coming to live here ? '' <EOS>	59.04147730960992
<SOS> `` yes , my friend , '' returned the count ; `` and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master . '' <EOS>	65.06306214190919
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur , '' said the concierge , `` i shall not have much cause to regret him , for he came here but seldom ; it is five years since he was here last , and he did well to sell the house , for it did not bring him in anything at all . '' <EOS>	84.8905150804176
<SOS> `` what was the name of your old master ? '' <EOS>	54.0891784825425
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	99.61836534240425
<SOS> `` the marquis of saint méran . <EOS>	113.31653792774534
<SOS> ah , i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it . '' <EOS>	71.8571938381589
<SOS> `` the marquis of saint méran ! '' <EOS>	77.51136300516974
<SOS> returned the count . <EOS>	88.91246028477545
<SOS> `` the name is not unknown to me ; the marquis of saint méran ! '' <EOS>	101.49200128248127
<SOS> and he appeared to meditate . <EOS>	49.87268594519577
<SOS> `` an old gentleman , '' continued the concierge , `` a staunch follower of the bourbons ; he had an only daughter , who married m. de villefort , who had been the king 's attorney at nîmes , and afterwards at versailles . '' <EOS>	52.20648822687885
<SOS> monte cristo glanced at bertuccio , who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling . <EOS>	79.02520677363947
<SOS> `` and is not this daughter dead ? '' <EOS>	87.07379870327192
<SOS> demanded monte cristo ; `` i fancy i have heard so . '' <EOS>	118.69999880280487
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , one and twenty years ago ; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times . '' <EOS>	43.00487822410028
<SOS> `` thanks , thanks , '' said monte cristo , judging from the steward 's utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it . <EOS>	54.57290314675104
<SOS> `` give me a light . '' <EOS>	74.29364921435327
<SOS> `` shall i accompany you , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	69.81566822417253
<SOS> `` no , it is unnecessary ; bertuccio will show me a light . '' <EOS>	49.047506048250376
<SOS> and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces , which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge . <EOS>	72.49682981100686
<SOS> `` ah , monsieur , '' said he , after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves , `` i have not got any candles . '' <EOS>	64.09752382390894
<SOS> `` take one of the carriage lamps , bertuccio , '' said the count , `` and show me the apartments . '' <EOS>	52.32853719466295
<SOS> the steward obeyed in silence , but it was easy to see , from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled , how much it cost him to obey . <EOS>	101.77498473698823
<SOS> they went over a tolerably large ground floor ; a first floor consisted of a salon , a bathroom , and two bedrooms ; near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden . <EOS>	96.99785803652104
<SOS> `` ah , here is a private staircase , '' said the count ; `` that is convenient . <EOS>	101.69183910835254
<SOS> light me , m. bertuccio , and go first ; we will see where it leads to . '' <EOS>	72.9871612236739
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' replied bertuccio , `` it leads to the garden . '' <EOS>	72.0274222209184
<SOS> `` and , pray , how do you know that ? '' <EOS>	58.93101061568634
<SOS> `` it ought to do so , at least . '' <EOS>	41.302726710013985
<SOS> `` well , let us be sure of that . '' <EOS>	41.080296236488294
<SOS> bertuccio sighed , and went on first ; the stairs did , indeed , lead to the garden . <EOS>	69.76036953294907
<SOS> at the outer door the steward paused . <EOS>	101.67476319438786
<SOS> `` go on , monsieur bertuccio , '' said the count . <EOS>	44.16229122314179
<SOS> but he who was addressed stood there , stupefied , bewildered , stunned ; his haggard eyes glanced around , as if in search of the traces of some terrible event , and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections . <EOS>	51.582656817092456
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	65.34195592680038
<SOS> insisted the count . <EOS>	76.53775878855235
<SOS> `` no , no , '' cried bertuccio , setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall . <EOS>	60.83225067799851
<SOS> `` no , monsieur , it is impossible ; i can go no farther . '' <EOS>	80.09968710942846
<SOS> `` what does this mean ? '' <EOS>	66.81983203938543
<SOS> demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo . <EOS>	71.65897022933754
<SOS> `` why , you must see , your excellency , '' cried the steward , `` that this is not natural ; that , having a house to purchase , you purchase it exactly at auteuil , and that , purchasing it at auteuil , this house should be no . <EOS>	111.12820260863418

<SOS> i am sure you would not have forced me to come . <EOS>	67.98694914262911
<SOS> i hoped your house would have been some other one than this ; as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination ! '' <EOS>	71.97407990226728
<SOS> `` what , what ! '' <EOS>	58.93718661100676
<SOS> cried monte cristo , stopping suddenly , `` what words do you utter ? <EOS>	83.63195616534563
<SOS> devil of a man , corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions . <EOS>	83.23988449510881
<SOS> come , take the lantern , and let us visit the garden ; you are not afraid of ghosts with me , i hope ? '' <EOS>	84.61005149052957
<SOS> bertuccio raised the lantern , and obeyed . <EOS>	73.65889965158739
<SOS> the door , as it opened , disclosed a gloomy sky , in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant , only to sink into obscurity . <EOS>	104.93703807931419
<SOS> the steward wished to turn to the left . <EOS>	65.11159390934283
<SOS> `` no , no , monsieur , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	76.19313354855166
<SOS> `` what is the use of following the alleys ? <EOS>	89.68385493563902
<SOS> here is a beautiful lawn ; let us go on straight forwards . '' <EOS>	66.9935228384036
<SOS> bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow , but obeyed ; however , he continued to take the left hand . <EOS>	67.68555833282186
<SOS> monte cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped . <EOS>	98.43127758355604
<SOS> the steward could not restrain himself . <EOS>	74.4858510974873
<SOS> `` move , monsieur move away , i entreat you ; you are exactly in the spot ! '' <EOS>	62.54649532308579
<SOS> `` what spot ? '' <EOS>	96.28970237433266
<SOS> `` where he fell . '' <EOS>	66.46439900588955
<SOS> < num > m `` my dear monsieur bertuccio , '' said monte cristo , laughing , `` control yourself ; we are not at sartène or at corte . <EOS>	90.48921900533658

<SOS> `` monsieur , i implore you do not stay there ! '' <EOS>	55.13915573837997
<SOS> `` i think you are going mad , bertuccio , '' said the count coldly . <EOS>	80.05745897735311
<SOS> `` if that is the case , i warn you , i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum . '' <EOS>	69.7100476017289
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	58.27410737322755
<SOS> excellency , '' returned bertuccio , joining his hands , and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count 's laughter , had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him , and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience . <EOS>	55.32884906657116
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	60.84179814373732
<SOS> excellency , the evil has arrived ! '' <EOS>	88.60929011668577
<SOS> `` m. bertuccio , '' said the count , `` i am very glad to tell you , that while you gesticulate , you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him ; and i have always observed , that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret . <EOS>	90.4088846552374
<SOS> i knew you were a corsican . <EOS>	100.06316709116466

<SOS> but in france they are considered in very bad taste ; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs , judges who condemn , and scaffolds which avenge . '' <EOS>	92.82862143209954
<SOS> bertuccio clasped his hands , and as , in all these evolutions , he did not let fall the lantern , the light showed his pale and altered countenance . <EOS>	90.03158786495138
<SOS> monte cristo examined him with the same look that , at rome , he had bent upon the execution of andrea , and then , in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward `` the abbé busoni , then told me an untruth , '' said he , `` when , after his journey in france , in < num > , he sent you to me , with a letter of recommendation , in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities . <EOS>	108.44793091621051

<SOS> `` i do not deny it , '' returned the count ; `` but why are you thus agitated . <EOS>	96.35192257725883
<SOS> it is a bad sign ; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks , and such fever in the hands of a man . '' <EOS>	74.5024756374861
<SOS> `` but , your excellency , '' replied bertuccio hesitatingly , `` did not the abbé busoni , who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes , tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience ? '' <EOS>	71.30953894728317
<SOS> `` yes ; but as he said you would make an excellent steward , i concluded you had stolen that was all . '' <EOS>	106.43580272947412

<SOS> nothing , then , preventing my escape by this means , i examined the grounds . <EOS>	99.03559653036153
<SOS> the garden was long and narrow ; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle , and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage , that made a background for the shrubs and flowers . <EOS>	43.78477817585777
<SOS> in order to go from the door to the house , or from the house to the door , m. de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees . <EOS>	63.60877506535762

<SOS> i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take , and scarcely was i there when , amidst the gusts of wind , i fancied i heard groans ; but you know , or rather you do not know , your excellency , that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears . <EOS>	99.0506462640422
<SOS> two hours passed thus , during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly . <EOS>	79.0502422069861
<SOS> midnight struck . <EOS>	79.4902752364819
<SOS> as the last stroke died away , i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended . <EOS>	79.74734695889815

<SOS> the man in the mantle advanced towards me , but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand . <EOS>	53.197053971478226
<SOS> i was afraid , not of a struggle , but of a failure . <EOS>	96.81861010543606
<SOS> when he was only a few paces from me , i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade . <EOS>	85.59795630675438
<SOS> i was still unable to divine for what reason m. de villefort had this spade in his hands , when he stopped close to the thicket where i was , glanced round , and began to dig a hole in the earth . <EOS>	98.86025397887394
<SOS> i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle , which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely . <EOS>	65.14806645043731
<SOS> then , i confess , curiosity mingled with hatred ; i wished to see what villefort was going to do there , and i remained motionless , holding my breath . <EOS>	109.5100685739287

<SOS> i let him place the box in the hole he had made , then , while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation , i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast , exclaiming : `` ' i am giovanni bertuccio ; thy death for my brother 's ; thy treasure for his widow ; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped .

<SOS> after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart , and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia , i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them , and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour , it began to breathe , and cried feebly . <EOS>	62.90334726574833

<SOS> as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road , and i inquired where the asylum was ; the box confirmed my statement , the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents , the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else . <EOS>	73.83194888726044
<SOS> no objection was raised , but they pointed out the asylum , which was situated at the upper end of the rue d'enfer , and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces , so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child , while the other remained in my possession , i rang the bell , and fled with all speed . <EOS>	70.10653184134235

<SOS> `` partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me , partly to supply the wants of the poor widow , i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler , which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution . <EOS>	49.72218240672896
<SOS> the southern districts were ill watched in particular , in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon , nîmes , or uzès . <EOS>	75.58168553501058
<SOS> we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere . <EOS>	71.47203353027439
<SOS> since my brother 's assassination in the streets of nîmes , i had never entered the town ; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected , seeing that we would no longer come to him , was forced to come to us , and had established a branch to his inn , on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire , at the sign of the pont du gard . <EOS>	55.247570580629336
<SOS> we had thus , at aigues mortes , martigues , or bouc , a dozen places where we left our goods , and where , in case of necessity , we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom house officers . <EOS>	77.19730118071443
<SOS> smuggling is a profitable trade , when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed ; as for myself , brought up in the mountains , i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers , as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry , and an inquiry always looks back into the past . <EOS>	62.7462385270524

<SOS> i uttered a cry of joy ; the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child . <EOS>	59.79711462708767
<SOS> for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse . <EOS>	53.777143143014655

<SOS> no objection was raised , and the infant was given up to her . <EOS>	72.8872074390203
<SOS> ah , i confess , your excellency , when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle , i felt my eyes filled with tears . <EOS>	78.52569375165571

<SOS> he was a most lovely child , with large blue eyes , of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion ; only his hair , which was too light , gave his face a most singular expression , and added to the vivacity of his look , and the malice of his smile . <EOS>	50.65661872902193
<SOS> `` unfortunately , there is a proverb which says that 'red is either altogether good or altogether bad . ' <EOS>	56.68216705238295

<SOS> this child , for whom my poor sister would go to the town , five or six leagues off , to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats , preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves , the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor 's orchard , or the dried apples in his loft , when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden . <EOS>	52.81856886459139

<SOS> one day , benedetto , who had been gone from the house since morning , to our great anxiety , did not return until late in the evening , dragging a monkey after him , which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree . <EOS>	71.97126691183702
<SOS> for more than a month past , the mischievous child , who knew not what to wish for , had taken it into his head to have a monkey . <EOS>	65.17919224362956
<SOS> a boatman , who had passed by rogliano , and who had several of these animals , whose tricks had greatly diverted him , had , doubtless , suggested this idea to him . <EOS>	84.34833099245229

<SOS> `` 'oh , father , ' i exclaimed , 'you are very good . ' <EOS>	41.752045829185136
<SOS> `` 'but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation . ' <EOS>	84.62915435338267
<SOS> `` i extended my hand , and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate , but he stopped me . <EOS>	121.05246494489788
<SOS> `` 'it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow , ' said he ; ' i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you . <EOS>	71.42797460810493
<SOS> here , take this , ' continued he , after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency , and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service , and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so ? '' <EOS>	74.09651605307327
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the count ; `` i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully , bertuccio ; but you might have shown more confidence in me . '' <EOS>	67.20984520314572
<SOS> `` i , your excellency ? '' <EOS>	113.2560269002536
<SOS> `` yes ; you . <EOS>	68.96036547488421
<SOS> how comes it , that having both a sister and an adopted son , you have never spoken to me of either ? '' <EOS>	50.058280186205764
<SOS> < num > m `` alas , i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life . <EOS>	59.7880148371525
<SOS> anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister , i lost no time in hastening to corsica , but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning , the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day . <EOS>	59.08221315101819
<SOS> acting by my advice , my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto , who was continually tormenting her for money , as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession . <EOS>	106.01166482657726
<SOS> one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired , and disappeared and remained away all day , leaving the kind hearted assunta , who loved him as if he were her own child , to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence . <EOS>	64.77806218569934
<SOS> evening came , and still , with all the patient solicitude of a mother , she watched for his return . <EOS>	73.91132724741625
<SOS> `` as the eleventh hour struck , he entered with a swaggering air , attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions . <EOS>	50.939610599314406
<SOS> she stretched out her arms to him , but they seized hold of her , and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed : `` 'put her to torture and she 'll soon tell us where her money is . ' <EOS>	58.89301293072286
<SOS> `` it unfortunately happened that our neighbor , wasilio , was at bastia , leaving no person in his house but his wife ; no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling . <EOS>	58.47471920771087
<SOS> two held poor assunta , who , unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her , smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners . <EOS>	55.70557643911247
<SOS> the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows , then returned , and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations , and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier , expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted . <EOS>	82.48585959608506
<SOS> in the struggle her clothes caught fire , and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate . <EOS>	54.990946916217574
<SOS> covered with flames , assunta rushed wildly to the door , but it was fastened ; she flew to the windows , but they were also secured ; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks ; it was assunta calling for help . <EOS>	91.76058188368114
<SOS> the cries died away in groans , and next morning , as soon as wasilio 's wife could muster up courage to venture abroad , she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities , when assunta , although dreadfully burnt , was found still breathing ; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open , and the money stolen . <EOS>	64.0292089740747
<SOS> benedetto never again appeared at rogliano , neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him . <EOS>	64.5243338171608
<SOS> `` it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency , to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto , since all trace of him seemed entirely lost ; or of my sister , since she was dead . '' <EOS>	62.84590288470148
<SOS> `` and in what light did you view the occurrence ? '' <EOS>	61.30442114519468
<SOS> inquired monte cristo . <EOS>	87.60645655723772
<SOS> `` as a punishment for the crime i had committed , '' answered bertuccio . <EOS>	57.38524323148326
<SOS> `` oh , those villeforts are an accursed race ! '' <EOS>	55.69889723225422
<SOS> `` truly they are , '' murmured the count in a lugubrious tone . <EOS>	53.17958724074513
<SOS> `` and now , '' resumed bertuccio , `` your excellency may , perhaps , be able to comprehend that this place , which i revisit for the first time this garden , the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature , and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency , who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause . <EOS>	79.48000921745823
<SOS> at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m. de villefort , by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child . '' <EOS>	53.48726579373813
<SOS> `` everything is possible , '' said monte cristo , rising from the bench on which he had been sitting ; `` even , '' he added in an inaudible voice , `` even that the procureur be not dead . <EOS>	99.24341951186187
<SOS> the abbé busoni did right to send you to me , '' he went on in his ordinary tone , `` and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history , as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future . <EOS>	89.70703867318849
<SOS> as for that benedetto , who so grossly belied his name , have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone , or what has become of him ? '' <EOS>	73.338143693655
<SOS> `` no ; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself , i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast . <EOS>	71.09976960572223
<SOS> thank god , i have never heard his name mentioned by any person , and i hope and believe he is dead . '' <EOS>	56.613853203439184
<SOS> `` do not think so , bertuccio , '' replied the count ; `` for the wicked are not so easily disposed of , for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance . '' <EOS>	76.87912699272334
<SOS> `` so be it , '' responded bertuccio , `` all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again . <EOS>	66.33729566293776
<SOS> and now , your excellency , '' he added , bowing his head , `` you know everything you are my judge on earth , as the almighty is in heaven ; have you for me no words of consolation ? '' <EOS>	80.89260926031335
<SOS> `` my good friend , i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni . <EOS>	72.18962125661318
<SOS> villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you , and , perhaps , to others . <EOS>	101.46711858702722
<SOS> benedetto , if still living , will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other , and then be duly punished in his turn . <EOS>	63.13609488338621
<SOS> as far as you yourself are concerned , i see but one point in which you are really guilty . <EOS>	46.704695336636995
<SOS> ask yourself , wherefore , after rescuing the infant from its living grave , you did not restore it to its mother ? <EOS>	84.90182798814139
<SOS> there was the crime , bertuccio that was where you became really culpable . '' <EOS>	53.03218676919083
<SOS> `` true , excellency , that was the crime , the real crime , for in that i acted like a coward . <EOS>	96.21392021562765
<SOS> my first duty , directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life , was to restore it to its mother ; but , in order to do so , i must have made close and careful inquiry , which would , in all probability , have led to my own apprehension ; and i clung to life , partly on my sister 's account , and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance . <EOS>	64.63356416843895
<SOS> perhaps , too , the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own . <EOS>	54.43433216410144
<SOS> and then , again , i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother . '' <EOS>	65.40147246485915
<SOS> bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words , while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning . <EOS>	70.78324445246801
<SOS> after a brief silence , rendered still more solemn by the time and place , the count said , in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner : `` in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination ( the last we shall ever hold upon this subject ) , i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni . <EOS>	67.87054345022301
<SOS> for all evils there are two remedies time and silence . <EOS>	53.69220975501862
<SOS> and now leave me , monsieur bertuccio , to walk alone here in the garden . <EOS>	49.164908924997064
<SOS> the very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . <EOS>	63.468579650053876
<SOS> the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . <EOS>	59.42817093137801
<SOS> here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . <EOS>	58.575514567247296
<SOS> this to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , i assure you , a most agreeable surprise . <EOS>	52.86608548739593
<SOS> i have no fear of ghosts , and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . <EOS>	104.4196528616565
<SOS> retire within , bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . <EOS>	50.61550817209438
<SOS> should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbé busoni , send for me , if i am still on earth , and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity . '' <EOS>	105.16878638947767
<SOS> bertuccio bowed respectfully , and turned away , sighing heavily . <EOS>	50.34619864391098
<SOS> monte cristo , left alone , took three or four steps onwards , and murmured : `` here , beneath this plane tree , must have been where the infant 's grave was dug . <EOS>	53.04170746671461
<SOS> there is the little door opening into the garden . <EOS>	59.55259927411738
<SOS> at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment . <EOS>	88.22029051464507
<SOS> there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars , for there , before my eyes , beneath my feet , all around me , i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth . '' <EOS>	51.7167616902681
<SOS> after making the tour of the garden a second time , the count re entered his carriage , while bertuccio , who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master 's features , took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word . <EOS>	79.07912648706602
<SOS> the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris . <EOS>	76.63431878318865
<SOS> that same evening , upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées , the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner . <EOS>	69.93984243750414
<SOS> nor , although preceding the party , did he once mistake one door for another , or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit . <EOS>	109.08208096451517
<SOS> ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey . <EOS>	76.05231128746514
<SOS> having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house , the count , drawing out his watch , said to the attentive nubian : `` it is half past eleven o'clock ; haydée will soon be here . <EOS>	51.91154743041623
<SOS> have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ? '' <EOS>	106.30332362779137
<SOS> ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek , which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance , that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence . <EOS>	71.0379737081816
<SOS> ali , having pointed to the apartments , held up three fingers of his right hand , and then , placing it beneath his head , shut his eyes , and feigned to sleep . <EOS>	83.29228283803847
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said monte cristo , well acquainted with ali 's pantomime ; `` you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber . '' <EOS>	75.16297405127645
<SOS> ali , with considerable animation , made a sign in the affirmative . <EOS>	39.94209887603252
<SOS> `` madame will be tired tonight , '' continued monte cristo , `` and will , no doubt , wish to rest . <EOS>	72.8963023638246
<SOS> desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions , but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire . <EOS>	92.98122010889351
<SOS> you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country . '' <EOS>	63.135838436558764
<SOS> he bowed . <EOS>	91.1886760244858
<SOS> just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge . <EOS>	106.88030468631175
<SOS> the gate opened , a carriage rolled down the avenue , and stopped at the steps . <EOS>	62.743785376598595
<SOS> the count hastily descended , presented himself at the already opened carriage door , and held out his hand to a young woman , completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold . <EOS>	72.01486600402585
<SOS> she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips , and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect . <EOS>	82.0350751788931
<SOS> some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse . <EOS>	105.15971578856292
<SOS> the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness , while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity . <EOS>	69.42188945731519
<SOS> preceded by ali , who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand , the young lady , who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristo 's companion in italy , was conducted to her apartments , while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself . <EOS>	53.855872628039315
<SOS> in another hour every light in the house was extinguished , and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept . <EOS>	101.32282735721633
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	111.37988577605535
<SOS> unlimited credit about two o'clock the following day a calash , drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses , stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person , dressed in a blue coat , with buttons of a similar color , a white waistcoat , over which was displayed a massive gold chain , brown trousers , and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person , in a word , who , although evidently past fifty , desired to be taken for not more than forty , bent forwards from the carriage door , on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron , and directed his groom to inquire at the porter 's lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there , and if he were within . <EOS>	84.98150916118787
<SOS> while waiting , the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house , the garden as far as he could distinguish it , and the livery of servants who passed to and fro , with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent . <EOS>	80.5587303227372
<SOS> his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence ; his lips were straight , and so thin that , as they closed , they were drawn in over the teeth ; his cheek bones were broad and projecting , a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness ; while the flatness of his forehead , and the enlargement of the back of his skull , which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears , combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing , save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable , more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt , and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole . <EOS>	85.38722824777027
<SOS> the groom , in obedience to his orders , tapped at the window of the porter 's lodge , saying : `` pray , does not the count of monte cristo live here ? '' <EOS>	63.762689654050526
<SOS> `` his excellency does reside here , '' replied the concierge ; `` but `` added he , glancing an inquiring look at ali . <EOS>	74.59922883879663
<SOS> ali returned a sign in the negative . <EOS>	66.78639911364202
<SOS> `` but what ? '' <EOS>	63.59343785322261
<SOS> asked the groom . <EOS>	57.97148762950582
<SOS> `` his excellency does not receive visitors today . '' <EOS>	95.56117287096706
<SOS> `` then here is my master 's card , the baron danglars . <EOS>	67.21631985938781
<SOS> you will take it to the count , and say that , although in haste to attend the chamber , my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him . '' <EOS>	55.701838722861886
<SOS> `` i never speak to his excellency , '' replied the concierge ; `` the valet de chambre will carry your message . '' <EOS>	74.67964900246058
<SOS> the groom returned to the carriage . <EOS>	46.12828788358516
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	77.0171668296598
<SOS> asked danglars . <EOS>	78.12311368513603
<SOS> the man , somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received , repeated what the concierge had said . <EOS>	88.16974992221789
<SOS> `` bless me , '' murmured baron danglars , `` this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him 'excellency , ' and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre . <EOS>	70.22308191626571
<SOS> however , it does not signify ; he has a letter of credit on me , so i must see him when he requires his money . '' <EOS>	77.89883717269942
<SOS> then , throwing himself back in his carriage , danglars called out to his coachman , in a voice that might be heard across the road , `` to the chamber of deputies . '' <EOS>	119.56573995974827
<SOS> apprised in time of the visit paid him , monte cristo had , from behind the blinds of his pavilion , as minutely observed the baron , by means of an excellent lorgnette , as danglars himself had scrutinized the house , garden , and servants . <EOS>	92.21656947776492
<SOS> `` that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance , '' said the count in a tone of disgust , as he shut up his glass into its ivory case . <EOS>	51.91198927117238
<SOS> `` how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat , receding , serpent like forehead , round , vulture shaped head , and sharp hooked nose , like the beak of a buzzard ? <EOS>	67.65228826938682
<SOS> ali , '' cried he , striking at the same time on the brazen gong . <EOS>	63.377511384100366
<SOS> ali appeared . <EOS>	77.88847127024185
<SOS> `` summon bertuccio , '' said the count . <EOS>	79.73627673403642
<SOS> almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment . <EOS>	55.51976157918526
<SOS> `` did your excellency desire to see me ? '' <EOS>	95.62213952472096
<SOS> inquired he . <EOS>	110.0336309235676
<SOS> `` i did , '' replied the count . <EOS>	72.9203694162635
<SOS> `` you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door ? '' <EOS>	38.45451521281877
<SOS> `` certainly , your excellency . <EOS>	64.05953759849157
<SOS> i noticed them for their remarkable beauty . '' <EOS>	55.71432260430762
<SOS> `` then how comes it , '' said monte cristo with a frown , `` that , when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris , there is another pair , fully as fine as mine , not in my stables ? '' <EOS>	47.51092670842335
<SOS> at the look of displeasure , added to the angry tone in which the count spoke , ali turned pale and held down his head . <EOS>	117.66173198555589
<SOS> `` it is not your fault , my good ali , '' said the count in the arabic language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face `` it is not your fault . <EOS>	68.24815966409808
<SOS> you do not understand the points of english horses . '' <EOS>	66.67586296659668
<SOS> the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity . <EOS>	50.15093543348297
<SOS> `` permit me to assure your excellency , '' said bertuccio , `` that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours . '' <EOS>	74.72045658072469
<SOS> monte cristo shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	50.574586726695806
<SOS> `` it seems , sir steward , '' said he , `` that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price . '' <EOS>	67.29260589374476
<SOS> `` his excellency is not , perhaps , aware that m. danglars gave < num > , < num > francs for his horses ? '' <EOS>	105.4946676089764
<SOS> `` very well . <EOS>	104.57211067817929
<SOS> then offer him double that sum ; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital . '' <EOS>	49.96421855526144
<SOS> `` is your excellency really in earnest ? '' <EOS>	112.56958973137571
<SOS> inquired the steward . <EOS>	103.8561371174552
<SOS> monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased . <EOS>	84.11244836126565
<SOS> `` i have to pay a visit this evening , '' replied he . <EOS>	86.20441263991094
<SOS> `` i desire that these horses , with completely new harness , may be at the door with my carriage . '' <EOS>	53.92151870364621
<SOS> bertuccio bowed , and was about to retire ; but when he reached the door , he paused , and then said , `` at what o'clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready ? '' <EOS>	60.740820153977346
<SOS> `` at five o'clock , '' replied the count . <EOS>	80.77959795204058
<SOS> `` i beg your excellency 's pardon , '' interposed the steward in a deprecating manner , `` for venturing to observe that it is already two o'clock . '' <EOS>	58.47687686995902
<SOS> `` i am perfectly aware of that fact , '' answered monte cristo calmly . <EOS>	62.31966061537164
<SOS> then , turning towards ali , he said , `` let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady , that she may select those she prefers for her carriage . <EOS>	57.20833850321415
<SOS> request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me ; if so , let dinner be served in her apartments . <EOS>	57.169939655211415
<SOS> now , leave me , and desire my valet de chambre to come hither . '' <EOS>	75.21146537528367
<SOS> scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber . <EOS>	55.585381793062105
<SOS> `` monsieur baptistin , '' said the count , `` you have been in my service one year , the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me . <EOS>	81.34723458501965
<SOS> you suit me very well . '' <EOS>	66.31206465967323
<SOS> baptistin bowed low . <EOS>	72.24336075516007
<SOS> `` it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you ? '' <EOS>	101.7850340831074
<SOS> `` oh , your excellency ! '' <EOS>	104.19298545136333
<SOS> exclaimed baptistin eagerly . <EOS>	46.19058362760369
<SOS> `` listen , if you please , till i have finished speaking , '' replied monte cristo . <EOS>	70.30834642028232
<SOS> `` you receive < num > , < num > francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern , who continually risks his life for his country , obtains . <EOS>	65.22975649782383
<SOS> you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money . <EOS>	106.50374732247323
<SOS> then , though yourself a servant , you have other servants to wait upon you , take care of your clothes , and see that your linen is duly prepared for you . <EOS>	105.34145868975347
<SOS> again , you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet , amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages . '' <EOS>	69.93376562603007
<SOS> `` nay , indeed , your excellency . '' <EOS>	69.8550805558562
<SOS> `` i am not condemning you for this , monsieur baptistin ; but let your profits end here . <EOS>	62.54864074066586
<SOS> it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill . <EOS>	68.27022952284587
<SOS> i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action . <EOS>	65.35442335027808
<SOS> an error i readily forgive , but wilful negligence or forgetfulness , never . <EOS>	57.493198671648294
<SOS> my commands are ordinarily short , clear , and precise ; and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice , or even three times , than they should be misunderstood . <EOS>	73.81717383833309
<SOS> i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know , and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity . <EOS>	65.96042260182656
<SOS> if , then , i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably , to comment on my actions , or watch my conduct , that very instant you would quit my service . <EOS>	79.18044039916776
<SOS> you may now retire . <EOS>	62.81959807718082
<SOS> i never caution my servants a second time remember that . '' <EOS>	66.49600271390966
<SOS> baptistin bowed , and was proceeding towards the door . <EOS>	85.58070527020134
<SOS> `` i forgot to mention to you , '' said the count , `` that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment ; those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose ( as a matter of course ) all participation in this money , while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me , and among whom it will be divided at my death . <EOS>	80.2749327314169
<SOS> you have been in my service a year , your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so . '' <EOS>	88.8217621606504
<SOS> this address , delivered in the presence of ali , who , not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken , stood wholly unmoved , produced an effect on m. baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics . <EOS>	77.88617773739777
<SOS> `` i assure your excellency , '' said he , `` that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things , and i will take m. ali as my model . '' <EOS>	59.394087554205704
<SOS> `` by no means , '' replied the count in the most frigid tones ; `` ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities . <EOS>	106.1411176049087
<SOS> he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct , not being , as you are , a paid servant , but a mere slave a dog , who , should he fail in his duty towards me , i should not discharge from my service , but kill . '' <EOS>	80.3479028203967
<SOS> baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment . <EOS>	86.95935511311878
<SOS> `` you seem incredulous , '' said monte cristo , who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french . <EOS>	49.01264155616634
<SOS> the nubian smiled assentingly to his master 's words , then , kneeling on one knee , respectfully kissed the hand of the count . <EOS>	71.23407420071378
<SOS> this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m. baptistin . <EOS>	62.7621032010631
<SOS> the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire , and to ali to follow to his study , where they conversed long and earnestly together . <EOS>	60.55755279464237
<SOS> as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong . <EOS>	90.79778901362641
<SOS> when ali was wanted one stroke was given , two summoned baptistin , and three bertuccio . <EOS>	107.35636828667036
<SOS> the steward entered . <EOS>	95.06512784876988
<SOS> `` my horses , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	97.16309308359614
<SOS> `` they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired . <EOS>	70.4257731088801
<SOS> does your excellency wish me to accompany him ? '' <EOS>	85.3913722019235
<SOS> `` no , the coachman , ali , and baptistin will go . '' <EOS>	47.45074947489379
<SOS> the count descended to the door of his mansion , and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars . <EOS>	92.45686797822486
<SOS> as he passed them he said : `` they are extremely handsome certainly , and you have done well to purchase them , although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner . '' <EOS>	54.81651274765657
<SOS> `` indeed , your excellency , i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them , and , as it is , they have cost an enormous price . '' <EOS>	107.96571553178843
<SOS> `` does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful , '' inquired the count , shrugging his shoulders . <EOS>	59.92164316063049
<SOS> `` nay , if your excellency is satisfied , it is all that i could wish . <EOS>	101.71201523578782
<SOS> whither does your excellency desire to be driven ? '' <EOS>	92.3620365398769
<SOS> `` to the residence of baron danglars , rue de la chaussée d'antin . '' <EOS>	70.75689458872573
<SOS> this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace , from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive . <EOS>	54.55143761295277
<SOS> as bertuccio , with a respectful bow , was moving away , the count called him back . <EOS>	76.93270130625994
<SOS> `` i have another commission for you , m. bertuccio , '' said he ; `` i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance , between le havre and boulogne . <EOS>	92.46180139780238
<SOS> you see i give you a wide range . <EOS>	44.22578794633873
<SOS> it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor , creek , or bay , into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor . <EOS>	85.49445254180218
<SOS> she draws only fifteen feet . <EOS>	93.45024814162592
<SOS> she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal . <EOS>	46.38107136155686
<SOS> make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description , and when you have met with an eligible spot , visit it , and if it possess the advantages desired , purchase it at once in your own name . <EOS>	75.53967691805342
<SOS> the corvette must now , i think , be on her way to fécamp , must she not ? '' <EOS>	111.3172074462068
<SOS> < num > m `` certainly , your excellency ; i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles . '' <EOS>	86.59211176381581
<SOS> `` and the yacht . '' <EOS>	84.91993958635453
<SOS> `` was ordered to remain at martigues . '' <EOS>	53.045984861169735
<SOS> `` 't is well . <EOS>	69.64089711032152
<SOS> i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert . '' <EOS>	75.05368690628701
<SOS> `` and the steamboat ? '' <EOS>	79.73084905346228
<SOS> `` she is at châlons ? '' <EOS>	71.16378038567385
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	52.26463780680287
<SOS> `` the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels . '' <EOS>	61.49863862384218
<SOS> `` very good . '' <EOS>	55.01792835046559
<SOS> `` when you have purchased the estate i desire , i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road . '' <EOS>	60.626887639999936
<SOS> `` your excellency may depend upon me . '' <EOS>	115.17616550464103
<SOS> the count made a gesture of satisfaction , descended the terrace steps , and sprang into his carriage , which was whirled along swiftly to the banker 's house . <EOS>	107.64671890930337
<SOS> danglars was engaged at that moment , presiding over a railroad committee . <EOS>	58.25778269214834
<SOS> but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced . <EOS>	77.43081607858481
<SOS> as the count 's title sounded on his ear he rose , and addressing his colleagues , who were members of one or the other chamber , he said : `` gentlemen , pardon me for leaving you so abruptly ; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred , which is this , thomson & french , the roman bankers , have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo , and have given him an unlimited credit with me . <EOS>	58.175900047831675
<SOS> i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions , and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity . <EOS>	83.70790767574285
<SOS> i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he would n't be so rich . <EOS>	73.18493088438048
<SOS> but , would you believe it , 'he was not receiving . ' <EOS>	85.76142715612009
<SOS> so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty . <EOS>	62.8395641500455
<SOS> i made inquiries , and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property , and certainly it was very decently kept up . <EOS>	61.053016887041444
<SOS> but , '' pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles , `` an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given . <EOS>	49.52432270987329
<SOS> i am very anxious to see this man . <EOS>	102.00505862877144
<SOS> i suspect a hoax is intended , but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with . <EOS>	72.78603832505361
<SOS> 'they laugh best who laugh last ! ' '' <EOS>	114.16477904352261
<SOS> having delivered himself of this pompous address , uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath , he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room , whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d'antin . <EOS>	100.471046821308
<SOS> it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown , with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury . <EOS>	103.96379344994693
<SOS> he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals ; but which , mere copies as they were , seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling . <EOS>	90.90962563871372
<SOS> the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room . <EOS>	52.977572555434584
<SOS> with a slight inclination of the head , danglars signed to the count to be seated , pointing significantly to a gilded armchair , covered with white satin embroidered with gold . <EOS>	58.321490413313406
<SOS> the count sat down . <EOS>	65.92790337277947
<SOS> < num > m `` i have the honor , i presume , of addressing m. de monte cristo . '' <EOS>	76.71679527909417
<SOS> the count bowed . <EOS>	59.66487377363086
<SOS> `` and i of speaking to baron danglars , chevalier of the legion of honor , and member of the chamber of deputies ? '' <EOS>	59.862534824752366
<SOS> monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron 's card . <EOS>	60.54324038391809
<SOS> danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips . <EOS>	63.55182352183368
<SOS> `` you will , i trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you , '' he said , `` but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people . '' <EOS>	54.66359808979002
<SOS> `` so much so , '' replied monte cristo , `` that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count . '' <EOS>	70.16668297015406
<SOS> `` upon my word , monsieur , '' said danglars with affected carelessness , `` i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions ; but the fact is , i was made baron , and also chevalier of the legion of honor , in return for services rendered , but `` `` but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs. de montmorency and lafayette ? <EOS>	93.73123025765285
<SOS> that was a noble example to follow , monsieur . '' <EOS>	73.31354410327145
<SOS> `` why , '' replied danglars , `` not entirely so ; with the servants , you understand . '' <EOS>	55.79830175426009
<SOS> `` i see ; to your domestics you are 'my lord , ' the journalists style you 'monsieur , ' while your constituents call you 'citizen . ' <EOS>	58.67995276598275
<SOS> these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government . <EOS>	60.402550374288026
<SOS> i understand perfectly . '' <EOS>	49.39709732399814
<SOS> again danglars bit his lips ; he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort , and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial . <EOS>	69.6243975822659
<SOS> `` permit me to inform you , count , '' said he , bowing , `` that i have received a letter of advice from thomson & french , of rome . '' <EOS>	51.347377026704685
<SOS> `` i am glad to hear it , baron , for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants . <EOS>	62.97289369028229
<SOS> i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth . <EOS>	106.08375953937494
<SOS> but as regards the letter of advice , i am charmed to find that it has reached you ; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself . <EOS>	80.15765859538142
<SOS> you have received a regular letter of advice ? '' <EOS>	97.4077777111469
<SOS> `` yes , '' said danglars , `` but i confess i did n't quite comprehend its meaning . '' <EOS>	51.985916633885
<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	67.98701697068852
<SOS> `` and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you , in order to beg for an explanation . '' <EOS>	61.22882601657293
<SOS> `` go on , monsieur . <EOS>	63.70921313267805
<SOS> here i am , ready to give you any explanation you desire . '' <EOS>	106.86038243477782
<SOS> `` why , '' said danglars , `` in the letter i believe i have it about me '' here he felt in his breast pocket `` yes , here it is . <EOS>	43.241466230839706
<SOS> well , this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house . '' <EOS>	93.047810400755
<SOS> `` well , baron , what is there difficult to understand about that ? '' <EOS>	115.15350445954512
<SOS> `` merely the term unlimited nothing else , certainly . '' <EOS>	41.09175474458185
<SOS> `` is not that word known in france ? <EOS>	71.47240238911077
<SOS> the people who wrote are anglo germans , you know . '' <EOS>	70.48002499686794
<SOS> `` oh , as for the composition of the letter , there is nothing to be said ; but as regards the competency of the document , i certainly have doubts . '' <EOS>	91.22325258166249
<SOS> `` is it possible ? '' <EOS>	71.91606908924662
<SOS> asked the count , assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor . <EOS>	94.78810094150558
<SOS> `` is it possible that thomson & french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers ? <EOS>	93.3074102653126
<SOS> pray tell me what you think , baron , for i feel uneasy , i can assure you , having some considerable property in their hands . '' <EOS>	83.77789555093509
<SOS> `` thomson & french are perfectly solvent , '' replied danglars , with an almost mocking smile ; `` but the word unlimited , in financial affairs , is so extremely vague . '' <EOS>	67.13913928478286
<SOS> `` is , in fact , unlimited , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	81.65379303217613
<SOS> `` precisely what i was about to say , '' cried danglars . <EOS>	86.58325599156306
<SOS> `` now what is vague is doubtful ; and it was a wise man who said , 'when in doubt , keep out . ' '' <EOS>	99.39534225064229
<SOS> `` meaning to say , '' rejoined monte cristo , `` that however thomson & french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly , the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example . '' <EOS>	53.12858624928797
<SOS> `` not at all . '' <EOS>	70.70392977440349
<SOS> `` plainly enough ; messrs. thomson & french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m. danglars have their limits ; he is a wise man , according to his own showing . '' <EOS>	68.84181263254534
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' replied the banker , drawing himself up with a haughty air , `` the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned . '' <EOS>	75.25397802041606
<SOS> `` it seems , then , reserved for me , '' said monte cristo coldly , `` to be the first to do so . '' <EOS>	74.16748190993941
<SOS> `` by what right , sir ? '' <EOS>	62.25411622870794
<SOS> `` by right of the objections you have raised , and the explanations you have demanded , which certainly must have some motive . '' <EOS>	73.82030292578409
<SOS> once more danglars bit his lips . <EOS>	59.748132653194354
<SOS> it was the second time he had been worsted , and this time on his own ground . <EOS>	82.73460902485022
<SOS> his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him , and approached almost to impertinence . <EOS>	98.27359097056805
<SOS> monte cristo on the contrary , preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor , aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure , and thus possessed the advantage . <EOS>	82.98629402975723
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' resumed danglars , after a brief silence , `` i will endeavor to make myself understood , by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me ? '' <EOS>	105.15767269168926
<SOS> `` why , truly , '' replied monte cristo , determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained , `` my reason for desiring an 'unlimited ' credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need . '' <EOS>	44.096548136941244
<SOS> the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand . <EOS>	70.88473216275942
<SOS> so throwing himself back in his armchair , he said , with an arrogant and purse proud air : `` let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes ; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars , however limited , are still equal to meeting the largest demands ; and were you even to require a million `` `` i beg your pardon , '' interposed monte cristo . <EOS>	102.32915518543557
<SOS> `` i said a million , '' replied danglars , with the confidence of ignorance . <EOS>	88.31797852717429
<SOS> `` but could i do with a million ? '' <EOS>	40.07831354343608
<SOS> retorted the count . <EOS>	62.15762211477643
<SOS> `` my dear sir , if a trifle like that could suffice me , i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account . <EOS>	86.18529209639932
<SOS> a million ? <EOS>	93.6974492302163
<SOS> excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case . '' <EOS>	97.68607906451949
<SOS> and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards , and drew forth two orders on the treasury for < num > , < num > francs each , payable at sight to the bearer . <EOS>	86.47855528863859
<SOS> a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction . <EOS>	51.297653446531164
<SOS> the effect of the present revelation was stunning ; he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy . <EOS>	77.39267942604523
<SOS> the pupils of his eyes , as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly . <EOS>	69.85015613156958
<SOS> `` come , come , '' said monte cristo , `` confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson & french . <EOS>	48.92287667771385
<SOS> i understand , and foreseeing that such might be the case , i took , in spite of my ignorance of affairs , certain precautions . <EOS>	70.98750110970465
<SOS> see , here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received ; one from the house of arstein & eskeles of vienna , to baron rothschild , the other drawn by baring of london , upon m. lafitte . <EOS>	69.73523511203399
<SOS> now , sir , you have but to say the word , and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms . '' <EOS>	84.75277735735945
<SOS> the blow had struck home , and danglars was entirely vanquished ; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count , who held them carelessly between finger and thumb , and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures , with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting , had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker . <EOS>	108.94340346646723
<SOS> `` oh , sir , '' said danglars , after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held , and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him , `` three letters of unlimited credit ! <EOS>	70.08081038733533
<SOS> i can be no longer mistrustful , but you must pardon me , my dear count , for confessing to some degree of astonishment . '' <EOS>	85.26694090181319
<SOS> `` nay , '' answered monte cristo , with the most gentlemanly air , `` 't is not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded . <EOS>	82.82533189565983
<SOS> then , you can let me have some money , can you not ? '' <EOS>	46.499490269983646
<SOS> `` whatever you say , my dear count ; i am at your orders . '' <EOS>	87.04042512021162
<SOS> `` why , '' replied monte cristo , `` since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case ? '' <EOS>	58.616724364584016

<SOS> `` you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind ? '' <EOS>	99.0240112964405
<SOS> `` oh , my dear count , '' exclaimed danglars , `` i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you . '' <EOS>	102.5918060125949
<SOS> `` no , you merely wished to be convinced , nothing more ; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding , and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest , we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year , suppose we say six millions to `` `` six millions ! '' <EOS>	103.3045720295847
<SOS> gasped danglars `` so be it . '' <EOS>	75.70543292812074
<SOS> `` then , if i should require more , '' continued monte cristo in a careless manner , `` why , of course , i should draw upon you ; but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year , and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned . <EOS>	70.65591526596754

<SOS> `` the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o'clock tomorrow morning , my dear count , '' replied danglars . <EOS>	66.21104273766868
<SOS> `` how would you like to have it ? <EOS>	88.61741897049998
<SOS> in gold , silver , or notes ? '' <EOS>	103.92107947395282
<SOS> `` half in gold , and the other half in bank notes , if you please , '' said the count , rising from his seat . <EOS>	63.08718367581585
<SOS> `` i must confess to you , count , '' said danglars , `` that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe , and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me . <EOS>	59.1130668790716
<SOS> may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it ? '' <EOS>	88.94585775515517
<SOS> `` it has been in the family a very long while , '' returned monte cristo , `` a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital . <EOS>	45.12985681036628
<SOS> the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago , and they have only been employed by me within the last few years . <EOS>	55.57110804832179
<SOS> your ignorance on the subject , therefore , is easily accounted for . <EOS>	66.24791397601581
<SOS> however , you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long . '' <EOS>	88.77868791023519
<SOS> and the count , while pronouncing these latter words , accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d'épinay . <EOS>	97.13559921416439
<SOS> `` with your tastes , and means of gratifying them , '' continued danglars , `` you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade . <EOS>	56.64152019124516
<SOS> if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings , at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room . <EOS>	60.573782232730224
<SOS> if you will permit me , i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery , composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such . <EOS>	70.41264840375453

<SOS> `` you are perfectly right in objecting to them , for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old . '' <EOS>	107.81769412686175
<SOS> `` or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen , bartoloni , and canova ? <EOS>	78.62116884520901
<SOS> all foreign artists , for , as you may perceive , i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors . '' <EOS>	92.83623259183587
<SOS> `` you have a right to be unjust to them , monsieur ; they are your compatriots . '' <EOS>	116.15486492612285
<SOS> `` but all this may come later , when we shall be better known to each other . <EOS>	68.43959953566545
<SOS> for the present , i will confine myself ( if perfectly agreeable to you ) to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience , my dear count , but a client like you is almost like a member of the family . '' <EOS>	109.7129763120057
<SOS> monte cristo bowed , in sign that he accepted the proffered honor ; danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery . <EOS>	70.12717651690588
<SOS> `` is the baroness at home ? '' <EOS>	64.13142762220244
<SOS> inquired danglars . <EOS>	82.02935362098981
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , '' answered the man . <EOS>	65.90333806980897
<SOS> `` and alone ? '' <EOS>	83.73657934430152
<SOS> `` no , my lord , madame has visitors . '' <EOS>	71.380314918765
<SOS> `` have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame , or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito ? '' <EOS>	74.86968990387187
<SOS> `` no , indeed , '' replied monte cristo with a smile , `` i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing . '' <EOS>	53.60727641884806
<SOS> `` and who is with madame ? <EOS>	75.44416549724959
<SOS> m . <EOS>	70.6455633380718
<SOS> debray ? '' <EOS>	99.45445285603397
<SOS> inquired danglars , with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile , acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker 's domestic life . <EOS>	94.87298796545346
<SOS> `` yes , my lord , '' replied the servant , `` m. debray is with madame . '' <EOS>	103.83234215782541
<SOS> danglars nodded his head ; then , turning to monte cristo , said , `` m. lucien debray is an old friend of ours , and private secretary to the minister of the interior . <EOS>	102.29125197116386
<SOS> as for my wife , i must tell you , she lowered herself by marrying me , for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france . <EOS>	66.92588188270537
<SOS> her maiden name was de servières , and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne . '' <EOS>	66.88669735408267
<SOS> `` i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars ; but i have already met m. lucien debray . '' <EOS>	81.57442260518673
<SOS> `` ah , indeed ? '' <EOS>	106.70275570253112
<SOS> said danglars ; `` and where was that ? '' <EOS>	74.401556867829
<SOS> `` at the house of m. de morcerf . '' <EOS>	77.00793864546254
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	109.20899364532886
<SOS> you are acquainted with the young viscount , are you ? '' <EOS>	109.75156533571948
<SOS> `` we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome . '' <EOS>	59.476094416400194
<SOS> `` true , true , '' cried danglars . <EOS>	76.94538799276
<SOS> `` let me see ; have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins , and of his having had a miraculous escape ? <EOS>	83.28634218023132
<SOS> i forget how , but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy . '' <EOS>	94.48773506657464
<SOS> `` her ladyship is waiting to receive you , gentlemen , '' said the servant , who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress . <EOS>	56.58066823125374
<SOS> `` with your permission , '' said danglars , bowing , `` i will precede you , to show you the way . '' <EOS>	53.227791605401165
<SOS> `` by all means , '' replied monte cristo ; `` i follow you . '' <EOS>	85.40685399218246
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	59.39603587664526
<SOS> the dappled grays the baron , followed by the count , traversed a long series of apartments , in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth , until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room , hung with pink satin , covered with white indian muslin . <EOS>	74.52235041185833
<SOS> the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials ; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses , after the style and manner of boucher ; and at each side pretty medallions in crayons , harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment , the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed . <EOS>	48.67243493960834
<SOS> the truth was , it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m. danglars and his architect , who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day . <EOS>	81.54907935128851
<SOS> the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray . <EOS>	121.23028757112749
<SOS> m. danglars , however , while possessing a great admiration for the antique , as it was understood during the time of the directory , entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife 's favorite sitting room , where , by the way , he was never permitted to intrude , unless , indeed , he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself ; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced , than that of being the presenter of another , his reception being cordial or frigid , in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness . <EOS>	45.813047817227826
<SOS> madame danglars ( who , although past the first bloom of youth , was still strikingly handsome ) was now seated at the piano , a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work , while lucien debray , standing before a small work table , was turning over the pages of an album . <EOS>	56.669485236221604
<SOS> lucien had found time , preparatory to the count 's arrival , to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars . <EOS>	58.461363336140295
<SOS> it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf ; and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings , he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count , consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination . <EOS>	101.09121449122185
<SOS> already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf , it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to , and fully credited , all the additional circumstances detailed by debray . <EOS>	59.92721927350525
<SOS> this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution . <EOS>	87.9219376324331
<SOS> a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m. danglars ; the count , in return for his gentlemanly bow , received a formal though graceful courtesy , while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition , and with danglars a free and easy nod . <EOS>	108.49129505465913
<SOS> `` baroness , '' said danglars , `` give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo , who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome . <EOS>	112.47099001852266
<SOS> i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice , and that is , that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year , during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money . <EOS>	47.74141810456297
<SOS> that means balls , dinners , and lawn parties without end , in all of which i trust the count will remember us , as he may depend upon it we shall him , in our own humble entertainments . '' <EOS>	86.71468357641947
<SOS> in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address , madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months , and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance . <EOS>	46.02537202921328
<SOS> `` and when did you arrive here ? '' <EOS>	70.30661570497975
<SOS> inquired she . <EOS>	48.965616943164505
<SOS> `` yesterday morning , madame . '' <EOS>	52.16861010193786
<SOS> `` coming , as usual , i presume , from the extreme end of the globe ? <EOS>	116.49184932518683
<SOS> pardon me at least , such i have heard is your custom . '' <EOS>	76.2054330489622
<SOS> `` nay , madame . <EOS>	66.45945485427056
<SOS> this time i have merely come from cadiz . '' <EOS>	59.59870671154866
<SOS> `` you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit . <EOS>	111.47138609417063
<SOS> paris is a horrible place in summer . <EOS>	50.67560342827513
<SOS> balls , parties , and fêtes are over ; the italian opera is in london ; the french opera everywhere except in paris . <EOS>	63.57127704011754
<SOS> as for the théatre français , you know , of course , that it is nowhere . <EOS>	45.40595994176046
<SOS> the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory . <EOS>	88.30202484847645
<SOS> do you propose entering any horses at either of these races , count ? '' <EOS>	79.0866586981377
<SOS> `` i shall do whatever they do at paris , madame , if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement . '' <EOS>	49.7607167092572
<SOS> `` are you fond of horses , count ? '' <EOS>	62.91694640975663
<SOS> `` i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east , madame , and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women . '' <EOS>	79.29972729867369
<SOS> `` nay , count , '' said the baroness , `` it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first . '' <EOS>	47.15863780208613
<SOS> `` you see , madame , how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here . '' <EOS>	54.60311178732553
<SOS> at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir ; approaching her mistress , she spoke some words in an undertone . <EOS>	85.46666748983654
<SOS> madame danglars turned very pale , then exclaimed : `` i can not believe it ; the thing is impossible . '' <EOS>	61.2344522757153
<SOS> `` i assure you , madame , '' replied the woman , `` it is as i have said . '' <EOS>	60.83676619597143
<SOS> turning impatiently towards her husband , madame danglars demanded , `` is this true ? '' <EOS>	44.15621522139354
<SOS> `` is what true , madame ? '' <EOS>	65.47091264030932
<SOS> inquired danglars , visibly agitated . <EOS>	59.513219793365145
<SOS> `` what my maid tells me . '' <EOS>	70.14305771878927
<SOS> `` but what does she tell you ? '' <EOS>	69.7591418854208
<SOS> `` that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage , he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge . <EOS>	79.72674873245144
<SOS> i desire to know what is the meaning of this ? '' <EOS>	59.538401764381526
<SOS> `` be kind enough , madame , to listen to me , '' said danglars . <EOS>	68.48730674624694
<SOS> `` oh , yes ; i will listen , monsieur , for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give . <EOS>	41.896437110870416
<SOS> these two gentlemen shall decide between us ; but , first , i will state the case to them . <EOS>	68.5415319905202
<SOS> gentlemen , '' continued the baroness , `` among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars , are two that belong exclusively to me a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris . <EOS>	66.25775860401355
<SOS> but to you , at least , m. debray , i need not give a further description , because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known . <EOS>	63.10026589642385
<SOS> well , i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois ; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone positively gone . <EOS>	64.54070208729264
<SOS> no doubt m. danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs . <EOS>	85.20177103318834
<SOS> oh , what a detestable crew they are , these mercenary speculators ! '' <EOS>	43.95730175968882
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied danglars , `` the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you ; they were scarcely four years old , and they made me extremely uneasy on your account . '' <EOS>	67.78167808179947
<SOS> `` nonsense , '' retorted the baroness ; `` you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject , because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris . <EOS>	98.5894191228433
<SOS> but , perhaps , you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses ? '' <EOS>	82.61720735072518
<SOS> `` my dear love , pray do not say any more about them , and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance , only more quiet and steady . '' <EOS>	69.99110089912104
<SOS> the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt , while her husband , affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture , turned towards monte cristo and said , `` upon my word , count , i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner . <EOS>	64.92937373848093
<SOS> you are setting up an establishment , of course ? '' <EOS>	66.650465618917
<SOS> `` why , yes , '' replied the count . <EOS>	61.868350175146105
<SOS> `` i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses . <EOS>	65.2616963610871
<SOS> i have almost given them away , as it is ; but , as i before said , i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms . <EOS>	79.10566498150662
<SOS> they were only fit for a young man . '' <EOS>	71.65011519659838
<SOS> `` i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me , '' said monte cristo ; `` but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses , and i do not think they were dear . <EOS>	82.24410712640449
<SOS> there they are . <EOS>	65.02397858985093
<SOS> come , m. debray , you are a connoisseur , i believe , let me have your opinion upon them . '' <EOS>	54.24398164779368
<SOS> as debray walked towards the window , danglars approached his wife . <EOS>	87.22575476574134
<SOS> `` i could not tell you before others , '' said he in a low tone , `` the reason of my parting with the horses ; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them . <EOS>	82.39048623401962
<SOS> some madman or fool , bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can , actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost ; and the fact is , i have gained < num > , < num > francs by the sale of them . <EOS>	78.3443639278633

<SOS> there , what do you think now of the affair ? <EOS>	96.42615580792567
<SOS> was n't i right to part with the horses ? '' <EOS>	63.20043410940495
<SOS> madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt . <EOS>	89.02464175040613
<SOS> `` great heavens ? '' <EOS>	54.63790875830719
<SOS> suddenly exclaimed debray . <EOS>	49.66332248821984
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	103.66268170974803
<SOS> asked the baroness . <EOS>	94.27937224623068
<SOS> `` i can not be mistaken ; there are your horses ! <EOS>	54.17400503586236

<SOS> `` my dappled grays ? '' <EOS>	86.64026265268755
<SOS> demanded the baroness , springing to the window . <EOS>	93.24128700044778
<SOS> `` 't is indeed they ! '' <EOS>	79.47799838691844
<SOS> said she . <EOS>	106.74241959424872
<SOS> danglars looked absolutely stupefied . <EOS>	107.97827610515394
<SOS> `` how very singular , '' cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment . <EOS>	48.480618597376136
<SOS> `` i can not believe it , '' murmured the banker . <EOS>	106.63240151075168
<SOS> madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray , who approached monte cristo , saying , `` the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses . '' <EOS>	57.6532086374074
<SOS> `` i scarcely know , '' replied the count ; `` it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward , and cost me well , somewhere about < num > , < num > francs . '' <EOS>	61.50517485997177
<SOS> debray conveyed the count 's reply to the baroness . <EOS>	66.37086151926547
<SOS> poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him . <EOS>	90.96547417678744
<SOS> `` see , '' said the count , `` how very ungrateful women are . <EOS>	56.47970390303029
<SOS> your kind attention , in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses , does not seem to have made the least impression on her . <EOS>	60.42064275365818
<SOS> but so it is ; a woman will often , from mere wilfulness , prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe . <EOS>	97.85954897070324
<SOS> therefore , in my opinion , my dear baron , the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies , and allow them to act as they please , and then , if any mischief follows , why , at least , they have no one to blame but themselves . '' <EOS>	77.70262626403611
<SOS> danglars made no reply ; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness , whose frowning brow , like that of olympic jove , predicted a storm . <EOS>	75.83243409776411
<SOS> debray , who perceived the gathering clouds , and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars ' rage , suddenly recollected an appointment , which compelled him to take his leave ; while monte cristo , unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain , made a farewell bow and departed , leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife . <EOS>	88.83278359965458
<SOS> < num > m `` excellent , '' murmured monte cristo to himself , as he came away . <EOS>	72.69954196407886
<SOS> `` all has gone according to my wishes . <EOS>	50.49161443959604

<SOS> now , then , to play another master stroke , by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful ! <EOS>	63.17722832285488
<SOS> still , '' added he , `` amid all this , i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugénie danglars , whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make . <EOS>	62.63947292810929
<SOS> but , '' he went on with his peculiar smile , `` i am here in paris , and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that . '' <EOS>	109.87015728820397
<SOS> with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home . <EOS>	56.468280235983244
<SOS> two hours afterwards , madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count , in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite `` dappled grays , '' protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman 's regrets . <EOS>	45.67025260247066
<SOS> the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning ; only , by the count 's orders , in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads , had been fastened a large diamond . <EOS>	72.98786865674933
<SOS> to danglars monte cristo also wrote , requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire , and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses . <EOS>	69.75915613572734
<SOS> during the evening , monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil , accompanied by ali . <EOS>	87.24175552373167
<SOS> the following day , about three o'clock , a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count . <EOS>	55.71332088350677
<SOS> `` ali , '' observed his master , as the nubian entered the chamber , `` you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso , have you not ? '' <EOS>	55.19277674363594
<SOS> ali drew himself up proudly , and then returned a sign in the affirmative . <EOS>	92.31744987419633
<SOS> `` i thought i did not mistake . <EOS>	104.928741282704
<SOS> with your lasso you could stop an ox ? '' <EOS>	117.5116752042893
<SOS> again ali repeated his affirmative gesture . <EOS>	96.7063221064259
<SOS> `` or a tiger ? '' <EOS>	85.64495101741853
<SOS> ali bowed his head in token of assent . <EOS>	110.53226696385704
<SOS> `` a lion even ? '' <EOS>	66.41455672227087
<SOS> ali sprung forwards , imitating the action of one throwing the lasso , then of a strangled lion . <EOS>	87.4633330795656
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said monte cristo ; `` you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ? '' <EOS>	64.39115468981053
<SOS> ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions . <EOS>	80.96565787286504
<SOS> `` but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury ? '' <EOS>	53.569540440724055
<SOS> the nubian smiled . <EOS>	68.52489452082693
<SOS> `` it is well , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	62.29889620287915
<SOS> `` then listen to me . <EOS>	54.24230004049784
<SOS> ere long a carriage will dash past here , drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday ; now , at the risk of your own life , you must manage to stop those horses before my door . '' <EOS>	62.1945019603184
<SOS> ali descended to the street , and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house , and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count , who was watching him . <EOS>	44.81819522266372
<SOS> the count patted him gently on the shoulder , his usual mode of praising ali , who , pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him , walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house , and , seating himself thereon , began to smoke his chibouque , while monte cristo re entered his dwelling , perfectly assured of the success of his plan . <EOS>	63.739200958521494
<SOS> still , as five o'clock approached , and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count , the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner . <EOS>	90.98910381730542
<SOS> he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street , pacing the chamber with restless steps , stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels , then to cast an anxious glance on ali ; but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation . <EOS>	59.7872366626247
<SOS> suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard , and almost immediately a carriage appeared , drawn by a pair of wild , ungovernable horses , while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed . <EOS>	48.02219749977316
<SOS> in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other 's arms . <EOS>	90.43149947818468
<SOS> terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry . <EOS>	84.2290503320393
<SOS> the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones , and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster ; but it kept on in the middle of the road , and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror . <EOS>	66.59543520617294
<SOS> ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque , drew the lasso from his pocket , threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold , and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock , then the animal fell over on the pole , which snapped , and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way . <EOS>	70.07917726731414
<SOS> gladly availing himself of this opportunity , the coachman leaped from his box ; but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse , and held them in his iron grasp , till the beast , snorting with pain , sunk beside his companion . <EOS>	76.33162092573339
<SOS> all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital . <EOS>	82.47024145993777
<SOS> the brief space had , however , been sufficient for a man , followed by a number of servants , to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred , and , as the coachman opened the door of the carriage , to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand , while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy , who had lost consciousness . <EOS>	109.16006255425685
<SOS> monte cristo carried them both to the salon , and deposited them on a sofa . <EOS>	79.29313244139446
<SOS> `` compose yourself , madame , '' said he ; `` all danger is over . '' <EOS>	95.8620055778122
<SOS> the woman looked up at these words , and , with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been , pointed to her child , who still continued insensible . <EOS>	97.19385155063567
<SOS> `` i understand the nature of your alarms , madame , '' said the count , carefully examining the child , `` but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least injury ; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass . '' <EOS>	51.18109712191805
<SOS> `` are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears ? <EOS>	97.1994002911743
<SOS> see how deadly pale he is ! <EOS>	72.89109229595444
<SOS> my child , my darling edward ; speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again ! <EOS>	85.99169848255859
<SOS> oh , sir , in pity send for a physician ; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy . '' <EOS>	59.663269555684344
<SOS> with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand , monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions ; then , opening a casket that stood near , he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold , containing a liquid of the color of blood , of which he let fall a single drop on the child 's lips . <EOS>	57.060217250419605
<SOS> scarcely had it reached them , ere the boy , though still pale as marble , opened his eyes , and eagerly gazed around him . <EOS>	57.02847941684
<SOS> at this , the delight of the mother was almost frantic . <EOS>	68.06333399804438
<SOS> `` where am i ? '' <EOS>	52.328034940160485
<SOS> exclaimed she ; `` and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm ? '' <EOS>	118.66757412542121
<SOS> `` madame , '' answered the count , `` you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings . '' <EOS>	92.14248772234777
<SOS> `` my wretched curiosity has brought all this about , '' pursued the lady . <EOS>	42.34779932964594
<SOS> `` all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars ' beautiful horses , and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them . '' <EOS>	78.2241478004989
<SOS> `` is it possible , '' exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment , `` that these horses belong to the baroness ? '' <EOS>	65.78434180234443
<SOS> `` they do , indeed . <EOS>	71.53391717091793
<SOS> may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars ? '' <EOS>	59.507938868633
<SOS> < num > m `` i have that honor ; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred . <EOS>	109.59211725246413
<SOS> i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron ; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them , i ventured to send them back to her , with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands . '' <EOS>	65.67488619442459
<SOS> `` you are , then , doubtless , the count of monte cristo , of whom hermine has talked to me so much ? '' <EOS>	63.523811986428974
<SOS> `` you have rightly guessed , madame , '' replied the count . <EOS>	79.00007295975304
<SOS> `` and i am madame héloïse de villefort . '' <EOS>	79.3665706477537
<SOS> the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time . <EOS>	69.23257643144284
<SOS> `` how grateful will m. de villefort be for all your goodness ; how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child ! <EOS>	43.033895972344006
<SOS> most certainly , but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant , this dear child and myself must both have perished . '' <EOS>	61.79131181391304
<SOS> `` indeed , i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in . '' <EOS>	59.15622319778477
<SOS> `` i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man . '' <EOS>	74.65541716800271
<SOS> `` i beseech you , madame , '' replied monte cristo `` not to spoil ali , either by too great praise or rewards . <EOS>	89.11511841285463
<SOS> i can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render . <EOS>	49.21091074281849
<SOS> ali is my slave , and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me . '' <EOS>	89.3539849637175
<SOS> `` nay , '' interposed madame de villefort , on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression , `` nay , but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own . '' <EOS>	77.50902386707212
<SOS> `` his life , madame , belongs not to him ; it is mine , in return for my having myself saved him from death . '' <EOS>	78.43035159587406
<SOS> madame de villefort made no further reply ; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who , from the first instant she saw him , had made so powerful an impression on her . <EOS>	87.58899589736859
<SOS> during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort , monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms , lavishing on him the most tender endearments . <EOS>	89.67106258544862
<SOS> the child was small for his age , and unnaturally pale . <EOS>	67.31658473303506
<SOS> a mass of straight black hair , defying all attempts to train or curl it , fell over his projecting forehead , and hung down to his shoulders , giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment . <EOS>	69.3790912680329
<SOS> his mouth was large , and the lips , which had not yet regained their color , were particularly thin ; in fact , the deep and crafty look , giving a predominant expression to the child 's face , belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young . <EOS>	100.33699957034193
<SOS> his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother , and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir ; then , without asking permission of anyone , he proceeded , in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices , to pull the corks out of all the bottles . <EOS>	75.67780067239681
<SOS> `` touch nothing , my little friend , '' cried the count eagerly ; `` some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste , but even to inhale . '' <EOS>	59.80933068897373
<SOS> madame de villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son 's arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count . <EOS>	67.78100084599824
<SOS> at this moment ali entered . <EOS>	88.27556822779238
<SOS> at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure , and , holding the child still closer towards her , she said : `` edward , dearest , do you see that good man ? <EOS>	113.45225836380874
<SOS> he has shown very great courage and resolution , for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us , and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces . <EOS>	65.17260364671024
<SOS> thank him , then , my child , in your very best manner ; for , had he not come to our aid , neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks . '' <EOS>	102.0369321992548
<SOS> the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner , saying , `` he 's too ugly . '' <EOS>	53.08357949235309
<SOS> < num > m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes , while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed . <EOS>	54.64646345522899
<SOS> `` this lady , '' said the count , speaking to ali in the arabic language , `` is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives ; but the boy refuses , saying you are too ugly . '' <EOS>	74.13858671737209
<SOS> ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy , on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion ; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart . <EOS>	74.58138595116743
<SOS> `` will you permit me to inquire , '' said madame de villefort , as she arose to take her leave , `` whether you usually reside here ? '' <EOS>	65.89306097169326
<SOS> `` no , i do not , '' replied monte cristo ; `` it is a small place i have purchased quite lately . <EOS>	48.7480736482106
<SOS> my place of abode is no . <EOS>	74.14909139741081
<SOS> < num > , avenue des champs élysées ; but i see you have quite recovered from your fright , and are , no doubt , desirous of returning home . <EOS>	59.76312479519079
<SOS> anticipating your wishes , i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages , and ali , he whom you think so very ugly , '' continued he , addressing the boy with a smiling air , `` will have the honor of driving you home , while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash . <EOS>	64.66111403210063
<SOS> as soon as that important business is concluded , i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars . '' <EOS>	71.28830702304758
<SOS> `` i dare not return with those dreadful horses , '' said madame de villefort . <EOS>	93.63826943220077
<SOS> `` you will see , '' replied monte cristo , `` that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali . <EOS>	59.26502689805583
<SOS> with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs . '' <EOS>	79.76149561254499
<SOS> ali had , indeed , given proof of this ; for , approaching the animals , who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty , he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar , and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths . <EOS>	94.36289471493566
<SOS> then , commencing a loud whistling noise , he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes ; then , undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage , ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count 's chariot , took the reins in his hands , and mounted the box , when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses , he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start ; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated `` dappled grays , '' now changed into a couple of dull , sluggish , stupid brutes , was a slow , pottering pace , kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré . <EOS>	90.90008441394677
<SOS> < num > m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars : `` dear hermine , i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger , and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday , but whom i little expected to see today . <EOS>	46.98694581232675
<SOS> i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him ; but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits . <EOS>	81.26897378582201
<SOS> your horses got as far as ranelagh , when they darted forward like mad things , and galloped away at so fearful a rate , that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress , when a strange looking man , an arab , a negro , or a nubian , at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count , whose domestic he is , suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals , even at the risk of being trampled to death himself ; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape . <EOS>	77.60604787811158
<SOS> the count then hastened to us , and took us into his house , where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life . <EOS>	65.63056459462658
<SOS> he sent us home in his own carriage . <EOS>	54.92913639662407
<SOS> yours will be returned to you tomorrow . <EOS>	91.5961225055083
<SOS> you will find your horses in bad condition , from the results of this accident ; they seem thoroughly stupefied , as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man . <EOS>	104.80824528819282
<SOS> the count , however , has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days ' rest , with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time , will bring them back to as fine , that is as terrifying , a condition as they were in yesterday . <EOS>	41.77980007701416
<SOS> < num > m adieu ! <EOS>	39.126682476990965
<SOS> i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday ; but , after all , i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses , more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo , and certainly that illustrious personage , apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of , seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i , for one , delight in solving at any risk , even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses . <EOS>	96.66213088061191
<SOS> edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry , but fell lifeless into my arms ; nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over . <EOS>	60.25385231158873
<SOS> i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection , but there is a soul of iron in that delicate , fragile body . <EOS>	58.578935241438145

<SOS> i must and will see him again . <EOS>	42.2270948231403
<SOS> i have just made m. de villefort promise to call on him , and i hope the visit will be returned . <EOS>	75.73829486980232
<SOS> that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere . <EOS>	61.503526588527876
<SOS> albert related it to his mother ; château renaud recounted it at the jockey club , and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister ; even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count 's courage and gallantry , thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy . <EOS>	73.86826941049308
<SOS> vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort , with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment , of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure . <EOS>	103.85635077285285
<SOS> as for m. de villefort , he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letter , donned his dress suit , drew on a pair of white gloves , ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery , and drove that same night to no . <EOS>	88.5920798194064

<SOS> standing well at court , whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch , whether the government was doctrinaire liberal , or conservative ; looked upon by all as a man of talent , since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded ; hated by many , but warmly supported by others , without being really liked by anybody , m. de villefort held a high position in the magistracy , and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé . <EOS>	57.06007186937179
<SOS> his drawing room , under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage , scarcely eighteen , was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained . <EOS>	84.65923684039961
<SOS> a freezing politeness , a strict fidelity to government principles , a profound contempt for theories and theorists , a deep seated hatred of ideality , these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m. de villefort . <EOS>	56.651762383736546
<SOS> < num > m m. de villefort was not only a magistrate , he was almost a diplomatist . <EOS>	69.9255165972869
<SOS> his relations with the former court , of which he always spoke with dignity and respect , made him respected by the new one , and he knew so many things , that not only was he always carefully considered , but sometimes consulted . <EOS>	51.5722040752498
<SOS> perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m. de villefort ; but , like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign , he dwelt in an impregnable fortress . <EOS>	110.4856728997613
<SOS> this fortress was his post as king 's attorney , all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill , and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy , and thus to replace neutrality by opposition . <EOS>	89.87842350184798
<SOS> ordinarily m. de villefort made and returned very few visits . <EOS>	62.3328898344585
<SOS> his wife visited for him , and this was the received thing in the world , where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride , a manifestation of professed superiority in fact , the application of the axiom , pretend to think well of yourself , and the world will think well of you , an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks , `` know thyself , '' a knowledge for which , in our days , we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others . <EOS>	73.6973894055551
<SOS> to his friends m. de villefort was a powerful protector ; to his enemies , he was a silent , but bitter opponent ; for those who were neither the one nor the other , he was a statue of the law made man . <EOS>	104.47194166041994
<SOS> he had a haughty bearing , a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial . <EOS>	80.84546700674373
<SOS> four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based . <EOS>	57.11536124039946
<SOS> m. de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france . <EOS>	104.74985708209671
<SOS> he gave a ball every year , at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only , that is to say , five and forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls . <EOS>	41.35124736180505
<SOS> he was never seen at the theatres , at concerts , or in any place of public resort . <EOS>	79.47090668469103
<SOS> occasionally , but seldom , he played at whist , and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors , sometimes archbishops , or sometimes a prince , or a president , or some dowager duchess . <EOS>	74.95821146992928
<SOS> such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo 's door . <EOS>	73.49735293542714
<SOS> the valet de chambre announced m. de villefort at the moment when the count , leaning over a large table , was tracing on a map the route from st. petersburg to china . <EOS>	66.83155811813482
<SOS> the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice . <EOS>	65.17162382036936
<SOS> he was the same man , or rather the development of the same man , whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles . <EOS>	91.18977282509013
<SOS> nature , according to her way , had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself . <EOS>	76.72467191248087
<SOS> from being slender he had now become meagre ; once pale , he was now yellow ; his deep set eyes were hollow , and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face . <EOS>	94.78617846736711
<SOS> he dressed entirely in black , with the exception of his white tie , and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole , and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush . <EOS>	80.07500101901655
<SOS> although master of himself , monte cristo , scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned , and who , distrustful by habit , and especially incredulous as to social prodigies , was much more despised to look upon `` the noble stranger , '' as monte cristo was already called , as an adventurer in search of new fields , or an escaped criminal , rather than as a prince of the holy see , or a sultan of the thousand and one nights . <EOS>	94.5630648021194
<SOS> `` sir , '' said villefort , in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods , and of which they can not , or will not , divest themselves in society , `` sir , the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks . <EOS>	63.862635334338776
<SOS> i have come , therefore , to discharge this duty , and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude . '' <EOS>	68.33451697871239
<SOS> and as he said this , the `` eye severe '' of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance . <EOS>	91.06023354872995
<SOS> he spoke in a voice of the procureur general , with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say ( as we have before observed ) that he was the living statue of the law . <EOS>	88.69145874762783
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' replied the count , with a chilling air , `` i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother , for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all ; and the good fortune which occurred to me , monsieur , might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which , in its discharge , confers an undoubtedly great honor ; for i am aware that m. de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me , a favor which , however estimable , is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness . '' <EOS>	60.26983544320271
<SOS> villefort , astonished at this reply , which he by no means expected , started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears , and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman . <EOS>	63.424836310565894
<SOS> he glanced around , in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn , and seemed to fall easily on a topic . <EOS>	63.7344289828163
<SOS> he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered , and said : `` you seem geographically engaged , sir ? <EOS>	68.65858313950869
<SOS> it is a rich study for you , who , as i learn , have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map . '' <EOS>	96.04679324532971
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the count ; `` i have sought to make of the human race , taken in the mass , what you practice every day on individuals a physiological study . <EOS>	84.25088331091185
<SOS> i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole . <EOS>	114.99745391266063
<SOS> it is an algebraic axiom , which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity , and not from an unknown to a known ; but sit down , sir , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	103.12426637179645
<SOS> monte cristo pointed to a chair , which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself , while the count merely fell back into his own , on which he had been kneeling when m. villefort entered . <EOS>	117.92273032016162
<SOS> thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor , having his back towards the window , his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment , a conversation which assumed , as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf , a turn analogous to the persons , if not to the situation . <EOS>	68.37522420441034
<SOS> `` ah , you philosophize , '' replied villefort , after a moment 's silence , during which , like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent , he took breath ; `` well , sir , really , if , like you , i had nothing else to do , i should seek a more amusing occupation . '' <EOS>	62.89572542140559
<SOS> `` why , in truth , sir , '' was monte cristo 's reply , `` man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope ; but you said , i think , that i had nothing else to do . <EOS>	89.70827708767044
<SOS> now , really , let me ask , sir , have you ? <EOS>	55.22419619528847
<SOS> do you believe you have anything to do ? <EOS>	69.10057712642602
<SOS> or to speak in plain terms , do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything ? '' <EOS>	79.61946821328584
<SOS> villefort 's astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary . <EOS>	45.702136859848274
<SOS> it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong , or rather , to say the truth more exactly , it was the first time he had ever heard of it . <EOS>	93.41848092693566
<SOS> the procureur exerted himself to reply . <EOS>	62.1323747988336
<SOS> `` sir , '' he responded , `` you are a stranger , and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries , so you are not aware how human justice , so expeditious in barbarous countries , takes with us a prudent and well studied course . '' <EOS>	69.34910642324715
<SOS> `` oh , yes yes , i do , sir ; it is the pede claudo of the ancients . <EOS>	70.03966771084676
<SOS> i know all that , for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice , and i must say , sir , that it is the law of primitive nations , that is , the law of retaliation , that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god . '' <EOS>	47.72074180825494
<SOS> `` if this law were adopted , sir , '' said the procureur , `` it would greatly simplify our legal codes , and in that case the magistrates would not ( as you just observed ) have much to do . '' <EOS>	51.399253557410816
<SOS> `` it may , perhaps , come to this in time , '' observed monte cristo ; `` you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple , and simplicity is always perfection . '' <EOS>	65.48488099102393
<SOS> `` in the meanwhile , '' continued the magistrate , `` our codes are in full force , with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs , roman laws , and frank usages ; the knowledge of all which , you will agree , is not to be acquired without extended labor ; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge , and , when acquired , a strong power of brain to retain it . '' <EOS>	100.68076379312701
<SOS> `` i agree with you entirely , sir ; but all that even you know with respect to the french code , i know , not only in reference to that code , but as regards the codes of all nations . <EOS>	82.36635604876435
<SOS> the english , turkish , japanese , hindu laws , are as familiar to me as the french laws , and thus i was right , when i said to you , that relatively ( you know that everything is relative , sir ) that relatively to what i have done , you have very little to do ; but that relatively to all i have learned , you have yet a great deal to learn . '' <EOS>	63.62157700202692
<SOS> `` but with what motive have you learned all this ? '' <EOS>	66.20933566621498
<SOS> inquired villefort , in astonishment . <EOS>	66.73210193167995
<SOS> monte cristo smiled . <EOS>	76.91979772873881
<SOS> `` really , sir , '' he observed , `` i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man , you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society , beginning with man , and ending with man that is to say , in the most restricted , most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace . '' <EOS>	87.48249751247015
<SOS> `` pray , sir , explain yourself , '' said villefort , more and more astonished , `` i really do not understand you perfectly . '' <EOS>	62.52014925488559
<SOS> `` i say , sir , that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations , you see only the springs of the machine , and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act ; i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king ; and that the men whom god has put above those office holders , ministers , and kings , by giving them a mission to follow out , instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow , limited field of observation . <EOS>	67.90771871275824
<SOS> it is thus that human weakness fails , from its debilitated and imperfect organs . <EOS>	80.46495086758496
<SOS> tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man . <EOS>	59.15055001723089
<SOS> the nations took attila , who was doomed to destroy them , for a conqueror similar to other conquerors , and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions , that they might be known and acknowledged ; one was compelled to say , ' i am the angel of the lord ' ; and the other , ' i am the hammer of god , ' in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed . '' <EOS>	75.7260572713943
<SOS> `` then , '' said villefort , more and more amazed , and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman , `` you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned ? '' <EOS>	77.72387795611257
<SOS> `` and why not ? '' <EOS>	47.088608421393104
<SOS> said monte cristo coldly . <EOS>	89.72575778627079
<SOS> `` your pardon , sir , '' replied villefort , quite astounded , `` but you will excuse me if , when i presented myself to you , i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men . <EOS>	91.14402406675512
<SOS> it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself , possessors , as you are , of immense fortune at least , so it is said and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire , i merely repeat ; it is not usual , i say , for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society , in philosophical reveries , intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world . '' <EOS>	69.06485606006214
<SOS> `` really , sir , '' retorted the count , `` have you attained the eminent situation in which you are , without having admitted , or even without having met with exceptions ? <EOS>	86.62745677208171
<SOS> and do you never use your eyes , which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty , to divine , at a glance , the kind of man by whom you are confronted ? <EOS>	59.93951025373787
<SOS> should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law , but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession , a steel probe to search hearts , a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy ? '' <EOS>	77.06128159372624
<SOS> `` sir , '' said villefort , `` upon my word , you overcome me . <EOS>	79.3064149706812
<SOS> i really never heard a person speak as you do . '' <EOS>	100.0480829987114
<SOS> `` because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions , and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings . '' <EOS>	45.762029745135905
<SOS> `` and you allow then , sir , that spheres exist , and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us ? '' <EOS>	51.14219660817067
<SOS> `` why should they not ? <EOS>	70.50746420447376
<SOS> can you see the air you breathe , and yet without which you could not for a moment exist ? '' <EOS>	102.62295954333675
<SOS> `` then we do not see those beings to whom you allude ? '' <EOS>	56.43904986411396
<SOS> `` yes , we do ; you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form . <EOS>	72.94940150703712
<SOS> you touch them , come in contact with them , speak to them , and they reply to you . '' <EOS>	77.0571803696886
<SOS> `` ah , '' said villefort , smiling , `` i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me . '' <EOS>	75.2242042915825
<SOS> `` you have been served as you desire , monsieur , for you were warned just now , and i now again warn you . '' <EOS>	71.41017436678736
<SOS> `` then you yourself are one of these marked beings ? '' <EOS>	88.92197619037567
<SOS> `` yes , monsieur , i believe so ; for until now , no man has found himself in a position similar to mine . <EOS>	85.873165217496
<SOS> the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers , or a change of manners , or an alteration of language . <EOS>	98.00073011115856
<SOS> my kingdom is bounded only by the world , for i am not an italian , or a frenchman , or a hindu , or an american , or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite . <EOS>	93.97940135879902
<SOS> no country can say it saw my birth . <EOS>	110.68646872344277
<SOS> god alone knows what country will see me die . <EOS>	71.39435674812209
<SOS> i adopt all customs , speak all languages . <EOS>	78.77332950645935
<SOS> you believe me to be a frenchman , for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself . <EOS>	77.72803095011977
<SOS> well , ali , my nubian , believes me to be an arab ; bertuccio , my steward , takes me for a roman ; haydée , my slave , thinks me a greek . <EOS>	103.0394696910375
<SOS> you may , therefore , comprehend , that being of no country , asking no protection from any government , acknowledging no man as my brother , not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful , or the obstacles which paralyze the weak , paralyzes or arrests me . <EOS>	85.36649075450617
<SOS> i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors , for with perseverance i subdue even them , they are time and distance . <EOS>	109.6737714595613
<SOS> there is a third , and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being . <EOS>	78.40688241757921
<SOS> this alone can stop me in my onward career , before i have attained the goal at which i aim , for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms . <EOS>	79.82164508620446
<SOS> what men call the chances of fate namely , ruin , change , circumstances i have fully anticipated , and if any of these should overtake me , yet it will not overwhelm me . <EOS>	99.58153430728473
<SOS> unless i die , i shall always be what i am , and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard , even from the mouths of kings for kings have need , and other persons have fear of you . <EOS>	97.7844963307469
<SOS> for who is there who does not say to himself , in a society as incongruously organized as ours , 'perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king 's attorney ' ? '' <EOS>	66.03449862540424
<SOS> `` but can you not say that , sir ? <EOS>	94.44297219994706
<SOS> the moment you become an inhabitant of france , you are naturally subjected to the french law . '' <EOS>	89.05114863466027
<SOS> `` i know it sir , '' replied monte cristo ; `` but when i visit a country i begin to study , by all the means which are available , the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear , till i know them as well as , perhaps better than , they know themselves . <EOS>	89.10837972359116
<SOS> it follows from this , that the king 's attorney , be he who he may , with whom i should have to deal , would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should . '' <EOS>	124.31601621381043
<SOS> `` that is to say , '' replied villefort with hesitation , `` that human nature being weak , every man , according to your creed , has committed faults . '' <EOS>	65.655900427241
<SOS> `` faults or crimes , '' responded monte cristo with a negligent air . <EOS>	75.02846448146573
<SOS> `` and that you alone , amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so , '' observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat `` you alone are perfect . '' <EOS>	100.61595259621046
<SOS> `` no , not perfect , '' was the count 's reply ; `` only impenetrable , that 's all . <EOS>	64.07699455364958
<SOS> but let us leave off this strain , sir , if the tone of it is displeasing to you ; i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight . '' <EOS>	70.27657775547861
<SOS> `` no , no , by no means , '' said villefort , who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground . <EOS>	63.18304167082163
<SOS> `` no ; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level ; we no longer talk , we rise to dissertation . <EOS>	62.669759150014286
<SOS> but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs , and philosophers in their controversies , occasionally say cruel truths ; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way , or even philosophically , and i will say to you , rude as it may seem , 'my brother , you sacrifice greatly to pride ; you may be above others , but above you there is god . ' '' <EOS>	78.40994049215287
<SOS> < num > m `` above us all , sir , '' was monte cristo 's response , in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered . <EOS>	64.02111039598196
<SOS> `` i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot . <EOS>	52.662373547568684

<SOS> `` then , count , i admire you , '' said villefort , who , for the first time in this strange conversation , used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage , whom , until now , he had only called monsieur . <EOS>	57.94682984121584
<SOS> `` yes , and i say to you , if you are really strong , really superior , really pious , or impenetrable , which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing then be proud , sir , for that is the characteristic of predominance . <EOS>	113.75766072372042
<SOS> yet you have unquestionably some ambition . '' <EOS>	106.49990732489096

<SOS> `` and what may it be ? '' <EOS>	68.63400148369212
<SOS> `` i too , as happens to every man once in his life , have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth , and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world , and as he said before , so said he to me , 'child of earth , what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me ? ' <EOS>	98.06416120204062
<SOS> i reflected long , for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me , and then i replied , 'listen , i have always heard of providence , and yet i have never seen him , or anything that resembles him , or which can make me believe that he exists . <EOS>	98.36893089440993
<SOS> i wish to be providence myself , for i feel that the most beautiful , noblest , most sublime thing in the world , is to recompense and punish . ' <EOS>	75.7882769003678
<SOS> satan bowed his head , and groaned . <EOS>	104.26377811390533
<SOS> 'you mistake , ' he said , 'providence does exist , only you have never seen him , because the child of god is as invisible as the parent . <EOS>	50.124117577512

<SOS> < num > m `` sir , '' continued villefort , `` there is something to fear besides death , old age , and madness . <EOS>	95.37741041601892
<SOS> for instance , there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you , and yet which brings everything to an end . <EOS>	53.206318022936905
<SOS> you are still yourself as now , and yet you are yourself no longer ; you who , like ariel , verge on the angelic , are but an inert mass , which , like caliban , verges on the brutal ; and this is called in human tongues , as i tell you , neither more nor less than apoplexy . <EOS>	65.94563770816787
<SOS> come , if so you will , count , and continue this conversation at my house , any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you , and i will show you my father , m. noirtier de villefort , one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution ; that is to say , he had the most remarkable audacity , seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not , perhaps , like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth , but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest ; in fact , a man who believed himself , like you , one of the envoys , not of god , but of a supreme being ; not of providence , but of fate . <EOS>	66.47613949661117

<SOS> `` and what is your deduction from this compensation , sir ? '' <EOS>	92.01098491623347
<SOS> inquired monte cristo . <EOS>	89.30246929280507
<SOS> `` my deduction is , '' replied villefort , `` that my father , led away by his passions , has committed some fault unknown to human justice , but marked by the justice of god . <EOS>	74.76890562023034
<SOS> that god , desirous in his mercy to punish but one person , has visited this justice on him alone . '' <EOS>	56.53993420520364
<SOS> monte cristo with a smile on his lips , uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it . <EOS>	72.95393144986939
<SOS> `` adieu , sir , '' said the magistrate , who had risen from his seat ; `` i leave you , bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem , which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better ; for i am not a man to bore my friends , as you will learn . <EOS>	66.49189982156192
<SOS> besides , you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort . '' <EOS>	81.57680379190636
<SOS> the count bowed , and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet , the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen , who , on a signal from their master , followed him with every mark of attention . <EOS>	48.374993711353184
<SOS> when he had gone , monte cristo breathed a profound sigh , and said : `` enough of this poison , let me now seek the antidote . '' <EOS>	118.29312753182543

<SOS> haydée it will be recollected that the new , or rather old , acquaintances of the count of monte cristo , residing in the rue meslay , were no other than maximilian , julie , and emmanuel . <EOS>	72.66270726353413
<SOS> the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright , pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged , illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness , as , immediately after villefort 's departure , his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him , of tasting , at least , a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind . <EOS>	58.2435340835741
<SOS> even ali , who had hastened to obey the count 's summons , went forth from his master 's presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold ; while , as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron 's meditations , whatever they were , the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door , holding his breath , lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master 's happy reverie . <EOS>	90.81252814023762
<SOS> it was noon , and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée , as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy , but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness , in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations . <EOS>	72.8003037081144
<SOS> the young greek , as we have already said , occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count . <EOS>	106.3316646098709
<SOS> the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas ; the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce ; the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture ; while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed , with piles of soft and yielding cushions , that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose . <EOS>	62.87920014068951
<SOS> haydée had three french maids , and one who was a greek . <EOS>	62.33982531788433
<SOS> the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room , ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell , or to receive the orders of the romaic slave , who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress 's wishes to the three other waiting women ; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen . <EOS>	82.8579450485542
<SOS> the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments . <EOS>	82.81799862628172
<SOS> this was a sort of boudoir , circular , and lighted only from the roof , which consisted of rose colored glass . <EOS>	64.86282602371574
<SOS> haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions , covered with blue satin spotted with silver ; her head , supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms , rested on the divan immediately behind her , while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile , through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water . <EOS>	73.28226663696346
<SOS> her attitude , though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would , in a european , have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect . <EOS>	84.97440163858651
<SOS> her dress , which was that of the women of epirus , consisted of a pair of white satin trousers , embroidered with pink roses , displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair , that they might well have been taken for parian marble , had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes , beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls . <EOS>	58.515092835775654
<SOS> she wore a blue and white striped vest , with long open sleeves , trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls , and a sort of bodice , which , closing only from the centre to the waist , exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom ; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps . <EOS>	68.04219370720598
<SOS> the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves , whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles . <EOS>	74.96725612044729
<SOS> tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk , embroidered with pearls ; while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair , of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue . <EOS>	70.80659356995226
<SOS> the extreme beauty of the countenance , that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it , was peculiarly and purely grecian ; there were the large , dark , melting eyes , the finely formed nose , the coral lips , and pearly teeth , that belonged to her race and country . <EOS>	72.60516304166772
<SOS> and , to complete the whole , haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers . <EOS>	54.212624479596634
<SOS> monte cristo summoned the greek attendant , and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit . <EOS>	70.0711132668867
<SOS> haydée 's only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir , the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl 's picturesque attitude and appearance . <EOS>	84.65098389085664
<SOS> as monte cristo approached , she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile , and extending to him her other hand , said , with a smile of captivating sweetness , in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta : `` why demand permission ere you enter ? <EOS>	48.14413404595485
<SOS> are you no longer my master , or have i ceased to be your slave ? '' <EOS>	59.99320978963684

<SOS> `` have i by any means displeased you ? <EOS>	69.36758368017239

<SOS> `` i do n't want anybody else to talk to me . <EOS>	58.9814471224502

<SOS> `` do you remember your father , haydée ? '' <EOS>	99.4204818836479
<SOS> the young greek smiled . <EOS>	65.00191613186122

<SOS> `` you ? '' <EOS>	78.18438643634062
<SOS> cried she , with tones of thrilling tenderness , `` you are everywhere ! '' <EOS>	53.11057662172295
<SOS> monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his , and was about to raise it to his lips , when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it , and presented her cheek . <EOS>	56.57687633947999
<SOS> `` you now understand , haydée , '' said the count , `` that from this moment you are absolutely free ; that here you exercise unlimited sway , and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country , as it may suit your inclination . <EOS>	106.07075209427627

<SOS> the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn , to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork , an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter , and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles . <EOS>	74.68964032548762
<SOS> it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin . <EOS>	51.8603947481434

<SOS> oh , i assure you , sir , it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures , destined by their talents for higher stations , toiling together , and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house , taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three . <EOS>	77.21018409356209

<SOS> maximilian had scarcely finished his story , during which the count 's heart had swelled within him , when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat . <EOS>	62.484763713289624
<SOS> he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest ; then , after having led monte cristo around the little garden , he returned to the house . <EOS>	52.92553705176501
<SOS> a large vase of japan porcelain , filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume , stood in the salon . <EOS>	54.813100531056904
<SOS> julie , suitably dressed , and her hair arranged ( she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes ) , received the count on his entrance . <EOS>	77.31464019671878

<SOS> the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house , and he remained silent and pensive , forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation , which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged . <EOS>	94.0038979465079
<SOS> the silence became almost painful when , by a violent effort , tearing himself from his pleasing reverie : `` madame , '' said he at length , `` i pray you to excuse my emotion , which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here ; but contentment is so new a sight to me , that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband .

<SOS> the count 's cheeks became scarlet , and he coughed , in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth . <EOS>	81.5486706963463
<SOS> `` those born to wealth , and who have the means of gratifying every wish , '' said emmanuel , `` know not what is the real happiness of life , just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather .

<SOS> monte cristo rose , and without making any answer ( for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion ) walked up and down the apartment with a slow step . <EOS>	57.77165895489368
<SOS> `` our magnificence makes you smile , count , '' said maximilian , who had followed him with his eyes . <EOS>	57.53061626413446
<SOS> `` no , no , '' returned monte cristo , pale as death , pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings , while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover , beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion . <EOS>	72.13632163489413
<SOS> `` i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse , with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other . '' <EOS>	52.16746402643282
<SOS> `` count , '' replied maximilian , with an air of gravity , `` those are our most precious family treasures . '' <EOS>	57.73546558317226
<SOS> `` the stone seems very brilliant , '' answered the count . <EOS>	84.48766030020546
<SOS> `` oh , my brother does not allude to its value , although it has been estimated at < num > , < num > francs ; he means , that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now . '' <EOS>	93.23330152557496
<SOS> `` this i do not comprehend ; and yet i may not ask for an explanation , madame , '' replied monte cristo bowing . <EOS>	94.36384791054746
<SOS> `` pardon me , i had no intention of committing an indiscretion . '' <EOS>	82.22568500054781
<SOS> `` indiscretion , oh , you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject . <EOS>	76.4750225002596

<SOS> oh , would we could relate it everywhere , and to everyone , so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence . '' <EOS>	79.36096229737703
<SOS> `` ah , really , '' said monte cristo in a half stifled voice . <EOS>	63.72235253315446
<SOS> `` monsieur , '' returned maximilian , raising the glass cover , and respectfully kissing the silken purse , `` this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide , us from ruin , and our name from shame and disgrace , a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children , doomed to want and wretchedness , can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot . <EOS>	66.63747488238961
<SOS> this letter '' ( as he spoke , maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count ) `` this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution , and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry .

<SOS> monte cristo opened the letter , and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight . <EOS>	90.20106552088922
<SOS> it was the letter written ( as our readers know ) to julie , and signed `` sinbad the sailor . '' <EOS>	70.5512987779771
<SOS> `` unknown you say , is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you ? '' <EOS>	96.18308277090252
<SOS> `` yes ; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand , '' continued maximilian . <EOS>	61.56613398519698
<SOS> `` we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand , a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter . '' <EOS>	51.30510290409274

<SOS> he felt convinced of his identity , but he did not venture to address him . '' <EOS>	89.18791593555494

<SOS> `` an englishman you say ? '' <EOS>	51.47613610335306
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied maximilian , `` an englishman , who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french , at rome . <EOS>	68.54530205287084
<SOS> it was this that made me start when you said the other day , at m. de morcerf 's , that messrs. thomson & french were your bankers . <EOS>	89.85561052579658

<SOS> `` then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who , grateful for a kindness your father had shown him , and which he himself had forgotten , has taken this method of requiting the obligation ? '' <EOS>	83.2167369253026
<SOS> `` everything is possible in this affair , even a miracle . '' <EOS>	88.33037551850356

<SOS> `` which is evidently not his real name , but a fictitious one . '' <EOS>	43.615374843136834
<SOS> then , noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice : `` tell me , '' continued he , `` was he not about my height , perhaps a little taller , with his chin imprisoned , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely buttoned up , and constantly taking out his pencil ?

<SOS> `` no , '' returned monte cristo `` i only guessed . <EOS>	73.36826914254301

<SOS> `` without revealing himself ? '' <EOS>	66.9128881358709
<SOS> `` he was an eccentric being , and did not believe in the existence of gratitude . '' <EOS>	85.91979507146806

<SOS> < num > m `` he did not credit it at the period which i knew him , '' said monte cristo , touched to the heart by the accents of julie 's voice ; `` but , perhaps , since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist . '' <EOS>	77.60599354804575
<SOS> `` and do you know this gentleman , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	81.90590882117029
<SOS> inquired emmanuel . <EOS>	95.09228183815681
<SOS> `` oh , if you do know him , '' cried julie , `` can you tell us where he is where we can find him ? <EOS>	54.652575623918985
<SOS> maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him , he must believe in the gratitude of the heart ! '' <EOS>	73.83443367954727
<SOS> monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes , and he again walked hastily up and down the room . <EOS>	53.7163926052505
<SOS> `` in the name of heaven , '' said maximilian , `` if you know anything of him , tell us what it is . '' <EOS>	80.77459614360832
<SOS> `` alas , '' cried monte cristo , striving to repress his emotion , `` if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor , i fear you will never see him again . <EOS>	88.10323037997617
<SOS> i parted from him two years ago at palermo , and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions ; so that i fear he will never return . '' <EOS>	87.64745710212384
<SOS> `` oh , monsieur , this is cruel of you , '' said julie , much affected ; and the young lady 's eyes swam with tears . <EOS>	87.8304775047593
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied monte cristo gravely , and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie 's cheeks , `` had lord wilmore seen what i now see , he would become attached to life , for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind ; '' and he held out his hand to julie , who gave him hers , carried away by the look and accent of the count . <EOS>	64.22996698490564
<SOS> `` but , '' continued she , `` lord wilmore had a family or friends , he must have known someone , can we not `` `` oh , it is useless to inquire , '' returned the count ; `` perhaps , after all , he was not the man you seek for . <EOS>	55.38041515461937

<SOS> `` ah , in such a case one supposes `` `` sister , sister , '' said maximilian , coming to the count 's aid , `` monsieur is quite right . <EOS>	92.92852001869089
<SOS> recollect what our excellent father so often told us , 'it was no englishman that thus saved us . ' '' <EOS>	65.80597733249627
<SOS> monte cristo started . <EOS>	62.43103399949811
<SOS> `` what did your father tell you , m . <EOS>	68.93327042987212

<SOS> `` my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us . <EOS>	56.51228016794616

<SOS> how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever ; and on his death bed , when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light , this thought , which had until then been but a doubt , became a conviction , and his last words were , 'maximilian , it was edmond dantès ! ' '' <EOS>	100.51757836829994
<SOS> at these words the count 's paleness , which had for some time been increasing , became alarming ; he could not speak ; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour , said a few hurried words to madame herbault , and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian , `` madame , '' said he , `` i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally ; i value your friendship , and feel grateful to you for your welcome , for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings ; '' and he hastily quitted the apartment . <EOS>	64.94968193628804
<SOS> `` this count of monte cristo is a strange man , '' said emmanuel . <EOS>	60.38920141332817
<SOS> `` yes , '' answered maximilian , `` but i feel sure he has an excellent heart , and that he likes us . '' <EOS>	71.44415823851158

<SOS> pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honoré , and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood , where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction , extended a large garden , where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart , and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate , that dated from the time of louis xiii . <EOS>	53.80935824567548
<SOS> this noble entrance , however , in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases , as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom , had fallen into utter disuse . <EOS>	59.45806149712921
<SOS> the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself , with its thickly planted courtyard , opening into the faubourg saint honoré , and to the garden shut in by this gate , which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre . <EOS>	54.716780300093575
<SOS> for the demon of speculation drew a line , or in other words projected a street , at the farther side of the kitchen garden . <EOS>	88.56285590036782
<SOS> the street was laid out , a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate , but before construction was begun , it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables , by building along the line of the proposed street , and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself , one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris . <EOS>	92.99282928087601
<SOS> in matters of speculation , however , though `` man proposes , '' yet `` money disposes . '' <EOS>	86.96530511139149
<SOS> from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth , and the purchaser of the kitchen garden , having paid a high price for it , and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss , yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him , not only for his past outlay , but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition , contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners , at a yearly rental of < num > francs . <EOS>	92.81860694049158
<SOS> and so , as we have said , the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust , which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges , while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion , the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet . <EOS>	80.99794003402549
<SOS> true , the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices ; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance . <EOS>	58.85922685303419
<SOS> horticulture seemed , however , to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden ; and where cabbages , carrots , radishes , peas , and melons had once flourished , a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation . <EOS>	96.56805938377319
<SOS> a small , low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street , the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters , and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid . <EOS>	40.43164823849278
<SOS> towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall , without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces , as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air . <EOS>	65.64804158826959
<SOS> at one corner , where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day , a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house , which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it , though situated but a hundred paces off . <EOS>	73.78707955643533
<SOS> whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk , or as a place for meditation , was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare , the cool , refreshing shade , the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun , that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer , the incessant and melodious warbling of birds , and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion . <EOS>	57.347928198964155
<SOS> on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris , might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench , a book , a parasol , and a work basket , from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief , while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman , standing close to the iron gate , endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks , the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes , proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter . <EOS>	61.66486976597523
<SOS> at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened , and a tall , powerful young man appeared . <EOS>	94.29062513912584
<SOS> he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap , but his carefully arranged hair , beard and moustache , all of the richest and glossiest black , ill accorded with his plebeian attire . <EOS>	66.762149071781
<SOS> after casting a rapid glance around him , in order to assure himself that he was unobserved , he entered by the small gate , and , carefully closing and securing it after him , proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier . <EOS>	56.32675879663258
<SOS> at the sight of him she expected , though probably not in such a costume , the young woman started in terror , and was about to make a hasty retreat . <EOS>	41.22258470660971
<SOS> but the eye of love had already seen , even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades , the movement of the white robe , and observed the fluttering of the blue sash . <EOS>	66.79770256656136

<SOS> that would compromise the honor of the french army , to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise ; so i have become a gardener , and , consequently , adopted the costume of my calling .

<SOS> then , too , my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity ; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity , no one could oppose him ; he is all powerful even with the king ; he would crush you at a word . <EOS>	95.41885284302249

<SOS> you see , my dear , that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party . <EOS>	66.25178261507538

<SOS> and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence ( for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man , without the smallest regard for his feelings ) had made a strong impression on his mind ; for , naturally enough , it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner .

<SOS> maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern , which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way , under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it . <EOS>	75.8384049153436
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , mademoiselle ! '' <EOS>	51.660144689090615
<SOS> exclaimed a voice from behind the trees . <EOS>	82.34104672807258
<SOS> `` madame is searching for you everywhere ; there is a visitor in the drawing room . '' <EOS>	58.54780915027639
<SOS> `` a visitor ? '' <EOS>	68.05689015803439
<SOS> inquired valentine , much agitated ; `` who is it ? '' <EOS>	66.91425268044358
<SOS> `` some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	89.51496668716653
<SOS> `` i will come directly , '' cried valentine aloud . <EOS>	55.98431663738164
<SOS> the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate , to whom valentine 's `` i am coming '' was the customary signal of farewell . <EOS>	65.72218416112308
<SOS> `` now , then , '' said maximilian , leaning on the handle of his spade , `` i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m. de villefort . '' <EOS>	46.060504146272955
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	65.77351902845733
<SOS> toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort 's for the purpose of returning the procureur 's visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion . <EOS>	83.09166371179805
<SOS> madame de villefort , who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced , desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count ; and edward , who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days , made all possible haste to come to him , not from obedience to his mother , or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count , but from sheer curiosity , and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say : `` oh , that naughty child ! <EOS>	76.18213041137872
<SOS> but i ca n't be severe with him , he is really so bright . '' <EOS>	62.914917118613104
<SOS> after the usual civilities , the count inquired after m. de villefort . <EOS>	88.92417393466067
<SOS> `` my husband dines with the chancellor , '' replied the young lady ; `` he has just gone , and i am sure he 'll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went . '' <EOS>	41.2255596035347
<SOS> two visitors who were there when the count arrived , having gazed at him with all their eyes , retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires . <EOS>	72.65403260418489
<SOS> `` what is your sister valentine doing ? '' <EOS>	66.21140476336363
<SOS> inquired madame de villefort of edward ; `` tell someone to bid her come here , that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count . '' <EOS>	44.40531445150063
<SOS> `` you have a daughter , then , madame ? '' <EOS>	71.72554341761298
<SOS> inquired the count ; `` very young , i presume ? '' <EOS>	116.73732919610879
<SOS> `` the daughter of m. de villefort by his first marriage , '' replied the young wife , `` a fine well grown girl . '' <EOS>	86.23068733878164
<SOS> `` but melancholy , '' interrupted master edward , snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch , in order to make a plume for his hat . <EOS>	54.88322630793629
<SOS> madame de villefort merely cried , `` be still , edward ! '' <EOS>	94.24753530685729
<SOS> she then added , `` this young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for mademoiselle de villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty . <EOS>	57.33827330237478
<SOS> but what detains her ? <EOS>	55.63345105317657
<SOS> go , edward , and see . '' <EOS>	80.76581163550759
<SOS> `` because they are looking for her where she is not to be found . '' <EOS>	55.49678929121751
<SOS> `` and where are they looking for her ? '' <EOS>	70.26564997518703
<SOS> `` with grandpapa noirtier . '' <EOS>	50.28092570840942
<SOS> `` and do you think she is not there ? '' <EOS>	90.25772980050134
<SOS> `` no , no , no , no , no , she is not there , '' replied edward , singing his words . <EOS>	68.53635859720431
<SOS> `` and where is she , then ? <EOS>	58.364987985790805
<SOS> if you know , why do n't you tell ? '' <EOS>	88.56664519138403
<SOS> `` she is under the big chestnut tree , '' replied the spoiled brat , as he gave , in spite of his mother 's commands , live flies to the parrot , which seemed keenly to relish such fare . <EOS>	64.28794030126325
<SOS> madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring , intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine , when the young lady herself entered the apartment . <EOS>	84.43900614225309
<SOS> she appeared much dejected ; and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes . <EOS>	61.95260208268552
<SOS> valentine , whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her , was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen , with bright chestnut hair , deep blue eyes , and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother . <EOS>	49.47034503108209
<SOS> her white and slender fingers , her pearly neck , her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan . <EOS>	76.14846428636247
<SOS> she entered the apartment , and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much , saluted him without any girlish awkwardness , or even lowering her eyes , and with an elegance that redoubled the count 's attention . <EOS>	63.17429488003914
<SOS> he rose to return the salutation . <EOS>	83.91779819050016
<SOS> `` mademoiselle de villefort , my step daughter , '' said madame de villefort to monte cristo , leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand . <EOS>	81.00155209413536
<SOS> `` and m. de monte cristo , king of china , emperor of cochin china , '' said the young imp , looking slyly towards his sister . <EOS>	49.62382279522121
<SOS> madame de villefort at this really did turn pale , and was very nearly angry with this household plague , who answered to the name of edward ; but the count , on the contrary , smiled , and appeared to look at the boy complacently , which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm . <EOS>	46.5914845136778
<SOS> `` but , madame , '' replied the count , continuing the conversation , and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine , `` have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ? <EOS>	118.22587203068989
<SOS> i could not help thinking so just now ; the idea came over my mind , and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance ; excuse the remark . '' <EOS>	65.51548497785978
<SOS> `` i do not think it likely , sir ; mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society , and we very seldom go out , '' said the young lady . <EOS>	74.56119138386306
<SOS> `` then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself , madame , or this charming little merry boy . <EOS>	61.660817719515116
<SOS> besides , the parisian world is entirely unknown to me , for , as i believe i told you , i have been in paris but very few days . <EOS>	74.27263850354915
<SOS> no , but , perhaps , you will permit me to call to mind stay ! '' <EOS>	90.41126484692732
<SOS> the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts . <EOS>	74.84922055556589
<SOS> `` no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête ; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand , the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden , and you , madame , were under the trellis of some arbor . <EOS>	55.68662700208263
<SOS> pray come to my aid , madame ; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory ? '' <EOS>	58.924098119358995
<SOS> `` no , indeed , '' replied madame de villefort ; `` and yet it appears to me , sir , that if i had met you anywhere , the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory . '' <EOS>	76.09641942453766
<SOS> `` perhaps the count saw us in italy , '' said valentine timidly . <EOS>	74.46368145343031
<SOS> `` yes , in italy ; it was in italy most probably , '' replied monte cristo ; `` you have travelled then in italy , mademoiselle ? '' <EOS>	91.75242431029817
<SOS> `` yes ; madame and i were there two years ago . <EOS>	82.0105760318414
<SOS> the doctors , anxious for my lungs , had prescribed the air of naples . <EOS>	64.58829319249416
<SOS> we went by bologna , perugia , and rome . '' <EOS>	62.01802028312865
<SOS> `` ah , yes true , mademoiselle , '' exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought . <EOS>	108.7597379053181
<SOS> `` it was at perugia on corpus christi day , in the garden of the hôtel des postes , when chance brought us together ; you , madame de villefort , and her son ; i now remember having had the honor of meeting you . '' <EOS>	91.08879179820477
<SOS> `` i perfectly well remember perugia , sir , and the hôtel des postes , and the festival of which you speak , '' said madame de villefort , `` but in vain do i tax my memory , of whose treachery i am ashamed , for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before . '' <EOS>	66.71319705725179
<SOS> `` it is strange , but neither do i recollect meeting with you , '' observed valentine , raising her beautiful eyes to the count . <EOS>	42.42953674699688
<SOS> < num > m `` but i remember it perfectly , '' interposed the darling edward . <EOS>	67.41173912623273
<SOS> `` i will assist your memory , madame , '' continued the count ; `` the day had been burning hot ; you were waiting for horses , which were delayed in consequence of the festival . <EOS>	70.72497786842547
<SOS> mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden , and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock . '' <EOS>	94.29244338482388
<SOS> `` and i caught it , mamma , do n't you remember ? '' <EOS>	90.4915153646946
<SOS> interposed edward , `` and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail . '' <EOS>	57.12426092625755
<SOS> `` you , madame , remained under the arbor ; do you not remember , that while you were seated on a stone bench , and while , as i told you , mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent , you conversed for a considerable time with somebody ? '' <EOS>	87.27417678689878
<SOS> `` yes , in truth , yes , '' answered the young lady , turning very red , `` i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle ; he was a medical man , i think . '' <EOS>	121.029949405623
<SOS> `` precisely so , madame ; this man was myself ; for a fortnight i had been at that hotel , during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever , and my landlord of the jaundice , so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician . <EOS>	76.28570471387614
<SOS> we discoursed a long time , madame , on different subjects ; of perugino , of raphael , of manners , customs , of the famous aqua tofana , of which they had told you , i think you said , that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret . '' <EOS>	54.194408744683514
<SOS> `` yes , true , '' replied madame de villefort , somewhat uneasily , `` i remember now . '' <EOS>	88.1169801941033
<SOS> `` i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed , madame , '' continued the count with perfect calmness ; `` but i perfectly remember that , falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me , you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort . '' <EOS>	49.905590252706794
<SOS> `` yes , really , sir , you were in fact a medical man , '' said madame de villefort , `` since you had cured the sick . '' <EOS>	76.79317553417393
<SOS> `` molière or beaumarchais would reply to you , madame , that it was precisely because i was not , that i had cured my patients ; for myself , i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply , but still only as an amateur , you understand . '' <EOS>	80.03108973417234
<SOS> at this moment the clock struck six . <EOS>	70.70705860850292
<SOS> `` it is six o'clock , '' said madame de villefort , evidently agitated . <EOS>	113.4622640872785
<SOS> `` valentine , will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner ? '' <EOS>	77.42985702564124
<SOS> valentine rose , and saluting the count , left the apartment without speaking . <EOS>	85.40116131080316
<SOS> `` oh , madame , '' said the count , when valentine had left the room , `` was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away ? '' <EOS>	66.33186691039943
<SOS> `` by no means , '' replied the young lady quickly ; `` but this is the hour when we usually give m. noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence . <EOS>	57.641771811826466
<SOS> you are aware , sir , of the deplorable condition of my husband 's father ? '' <EOS>	105.6709149329204
<SOS> `` yes , madame , m. de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis , i think . '' <EOS>	58.94067022184886
<SOS> `` alas , yes ; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless ; the mind alone is still active in this human machine , and that is faint and flickering , like the light of a lamp about to expire . <EOS>	86.53147381871221
<SOS> but excuse me , sir , for talking of our domestic misfortunes ; i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist . '' <EOS>	53.0274341581338
<SOS> `` no , madame , i did not say as much as that , '' replied the count with a smile ; `` quite the contrary . <EOS>	91.41862281905861
<SOS> i have studied chemistry because , having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates . '' <EOS>	53.98485591612546
<SOS> `` mithridates , rex ponticus , '' said the young scamp , as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album , `` the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast . '' <EOS>	64.97664970331088
<SOS> `` edward , you naughty boy , '' exclaimed madame de villefort , snatching the mutilated book from the urchin 's grasp , `` you are positively past bearing ; you really disturb the conversation ; go , leave us , and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtier 's room .

<SOS> `` go go at once . '' <EOS>	57.392047179034805
<SOS> `` i wo n't go unless you give me the album , '' said the boy , seating himself doggedly in an armchair , according to his habit of never giving way . <EOS>	54.58559730011776
<SOS> `` take it , then , and pray disturb us no longer , '' said madame de villefort , giving the album to edward , who then went towards the door , led by his mother . <EOS>	73.55826629256553
<SOS> the count followed her with his eyes . <EOS>	65.4300603632785
<SOS> `` let us see if she shuts the door after him , '' he muttered . <EOS>	99.24857475039191
<SOS> madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child , the count appearing not to notice her ; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber , the young wife returned to her chair , in which she seated herself . <EOS>	80.1302266448288
<SOS> `` allow me to observe , madame , '' said the count , with that kind tone he could assume so well , `` you are really very severe with that dear clever child . '' <EOS>	74.98261758944518
<SOS> `` oh , sometimes severity is quite necessary , '' replied madame de villefort , with all a mother 's real firmness . <EOS>	84.58035782400893
<SOS> `` it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates , '' continued the count , `` and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him , for your son is really advanced for his years .

<SOS> `` the fact is , count , '' answered the mother , agreeably flattered , `` he has great aptitude , and learns all that is set before him . <EOS>	75.73403048403354
<SOS> he has but one fault , he is somewhat wilful ; but really , on referring for the moment to what he said , do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions , and that these precautions were efficacious ? '' <EOS>	91.83506218985102
<SOS> `` i think so , madame , because i myself have made use of them , that i might not be poisoned at naples , at palermo , and at smyrna that is to say , on three several occasions when , but for these precautions , i must have lost my life . '' <EOS>	50.36282030662521
<SOS> `` and your precautions were successful ? '' <EOS>	73.01811946900355

<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	102.91921693723486
<SOS> said the count with an air of surprise , remarkably well counterfeited ; `` i really did not remember . '' <EOS>	50.24686216038976
<SOS> `` i inquired of you if poisons acted equally , and with the same effect , on men of the north as on men of the south ; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south .

<SOS> `` and that is the case , '' observed monte cristo . <EOS>	68.78304502846119
<SOS> `` i have seen russians devour , without being visibly inconvenienced , vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab . '' <EOS>	61.97064747996942
<SOS> `` and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east , and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison ? '' <EOS>	64.99700962143226
<SOS> `` certainly ; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed . '' <EOS>	69.34480245563158
<SOS> `` yes , i understand that ; and how would you habituate yourself , for instance , or rather , how did you habituate yourself to it ? '' <EOS>	67.97827194221972
<SOS> `` oh , very easily . <EOS>	82.18787960993286
<SOS> suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you ; suppose the poison was , for instance , brucine `` `` brucine is extracted from the false angostura < num > is it not ? '' <EOS>	85.90573858493829

<SOS> `` precisely , madame , '' replied monte cristo ; `` but i perceive i have not much to teach you . <EOS>	40.60239186570495

<SOS> `` oh , i am aware of that , '' said madame de villefort ; `` but i have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are reducible to figures , like an algebraic equation ; but go on , i beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree .

<SOS> well , at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme , at the end of twenty days , increasing another milligramme , you would have taken three hundred centigrammes ; that is to say , a dose which you would support without inconvenience , and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself . <EOS>	111.02889455963108
<SOS> well , then , at the end of a month , when drinking water from the same carafe , you would kill the person who drank with you , without your perceiving , otherwise than from slight inconvenience , that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water . '' <EOS>	79.40280127869678

<SOS> `` no , madame , contrary to most history , it is true ; but what you tell me , madame , what you inquire of me , is not the result of a chance query , for two years ago you asked me the same questions , and said then , that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind .

<SOS> `` true , sir . <EOS>	83.71793555561884
<SOS> the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy , and subsequently , when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people , and the entire life of individuals in the east , as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair , i have regretted that i was not a man , that i might have been a flamel , a fontana , or a cabanis .

<SOS> there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity ; and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance .

<SOS> amongst us a simpleton , possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity , who has an enemy to destroy , or some near relation to dispose of , goes straight to the grocer 's or druggist 's , gives a false name , which leads more easily to his detection than his real one , and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping , purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow , he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers , and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced ; then , when he has acquired his specific , he administers duly to his enemy , or near kinsman , a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst , and which , without rhyme or reason , makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood . <EOS>	92.58868080663699
<SOS> then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables . <EOS>	66.20708576951148

<SOS> he had a remarkably fine garden , full of vegetables , flowers , and fruit . <EOS>	90.01309701049207
<SOS> from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage , for instance . <EOS>	79.3964282786556
<SOS> for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic ; on the third , the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow . <EOS>	55.31582081841453

<SOS> in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table , and preserved its wholesome appearance . <EOS>	80.61295144559946
<SOS> it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte . <EOS>	59.781895885847995
<SOS> he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits , cats , and guinea pigs , fully as fine as his collection of vegetables , flowers , and fruit . <EOS>	87.09153401354153
<SOS> well , the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit , and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage . <EOS>	76.04258960926887
<SOS> the rabbit died . <EOS>	79.56380694130274
<SOS> what magistrate would find , or even venture to insinuate , anything against this ? <EOS>	82.97524464522819

<SOS> not one . <EOS>	53.42246123611498

<SOS> this rabbit dead , the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill ; on this dunghill is a hen , who , pecking these intestines , is in her turn taken ill , and dies next day . <EOS>	90.31050217608441
<SOS> at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death , a vulture is flying by ( there are a good many vultures in adelmonte 's country ) ; this bird darts on the dead fowl , and carries it away to a rock , where it dines off its prey . <EOS>	87.99479474789904
<SOS> three days afterwards , this poor vulture , which has been very much indisposed since that dinner , suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds , and falls heavily into a fish pond . <EOS>	65.03178677030006
<SOS> the pike , eels , and carp eat greedily always , as everybody knows well , they feast on the vulture . <EOS>	68.36638905598137

<SOS> the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning , 'the subject has died of a tumor on the liver , or of typhoid fever ! ' '' <EOS>	80.69632786297862
<SOS> `` but , '' remarked madame de villefort , `` all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident ; the vulture may not see the fowl , or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond . '' <EOS>	105.61265973075038
<SOS> `` ah , that is where the art comes in . <EOS>	80.65080771231713
<SOS> to be a great chemist in the east , one must direct chance ; and this is to be achieved . '' <EOS>	85.42322836763532
<SOS> madame de villefort was in deep thought , yet listened attentively . <EOS>	54.02001140205048

<SOS> `` precisely so , '' cried monte cristo `` precisely so ; and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte . <EOS>	66.04107583417525
<SOS> he reflected , smiled , and replied to me by a sicilian proverb , which i believe is also a french proverb , 'my son , the world was not made in a day but in seven . <EOS>	55.417581730859375

<SOS> on the sunday following i did return to him . <EOS>	51.215045258515275
<SOS> instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic , he had watered it this time with a solution of salts , having their basis in strychnine , strychnos colubrina , as the learned term it . <EOS>	106.73736956876454
<SOS> now , the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world , and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust ; yet , five minutes afterwards , the rabbit was dead . <EOS>	62.719650068896826

<SOS> madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful . <EOS>	66.82546182988047
<SOS> `` it is very fortunate , '' she observed , `` that such substances could only be prepared by chemists ; otherwise , all the world would be poisoning each other . '' <EOS>	81.84065273063062
<SOS> `` by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry , '' said monte cristo carelessly . <EOS>	50.807041963990194
<SOS> `` and then , '' said madame de villefort , endeavoring by a struggle , and with effort , to get away from her thoughts , `` however skilfully it is prepared , crime is always crime , and if it avoid human scrutiny , it does not escape the eye of god . <EOS>	60.55269785087075
<SOS> the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience , and , very prudently , have no hell that is the point . '' <EOS>	110.05656122264288
<SOS> < num > m `` really , madame , this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours , but which would easily yield before sound reasoning . <EOS>	72.92342722391712

<SOS> man 's whole life passes in doing these things , and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them . <EOS>	84.20730336723965
<SOS> you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature , or will administer to him , in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation , that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked . <EOS>	81.09826846463683
<SOS> such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid . <EOS>	85.43284570148134
<SOS> to attain such a point , the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees , the pulse be , at least , at ninety , and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit . <EOS>	72.41550755590183
<SOS> but suppose one pass , as is permissible in philology , from the word itself to its softened synonym , then , instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an 'elimination ; ' you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way , and that without shock or violence , without the display of the sufferings which , in the case of becoming a punishment , make a martyr of the victim , and a butcher , in every sense of the word , of him who inflicts them . <EOS>	106.20734081508118
<SOS> then there will be no blood , no groans , no convulsions , and above all , no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act , then one escapes the clutch of the human law , which says , 'do not disturb society ! ' <EOS>	64.21869525150338
<SOS> this is the mode in which they manage these things , and succeed in eastern climes , where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance . '' <EOS>	77.59090253643897
<SOS> `` yet conscience remains , '' remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice , and with a stifled sigh . <EOS>	89.7722981801328
<SOS> `` yes , '' answered monte cristo `` happily , yes , conscience does remain ; and if it did not , how wretched we should be ! <EOS>	64.07455291037581
<SOS> after every action requiring exertion , it is conscience that saves us , for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , howsoever excellent in producing sleep , would avail us but very little before a tribunal , when we were tried for our lives . <EOS>	87.74004000486657
<SOS> thus richard iii. , for instance , was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv . <EOS>	79.8184463598972

<SOS> to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire , who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king 's ransom in his waistcoat pocket . <EOS>	71.61815392850463
<SOS> danglars had , however , protested against showing himself in a ministerial box , declaring that his political principles , and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself ; the baroness had , therefore , despatched a note to lucien debray , bidding him call for them , it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera . <EOS>	52.27705824071096
<SOS> there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort , while the addition of a third , in the person of her mother 's admitted lover , enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature . <EOS>	86.0943088116024
<SOS> one must take the world as one finds it . <EOS>	50.93837007888304
<SOS> < num > m the curtain rose , as usual , to an almost empty house , it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance , so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it , that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals , while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors , and the buzz of conversation . <EOS>	101.90641800779217
<SOS> `` surely , '' said albert , as the door of a box on the first circle opened , `` that must be the countess g . '' <EOS>	81.586326548536
<SOS> `` and who is the countess g ? '' <EOS>	54.7506092566645
<SOS> inquired château renaud . <EOS>	100.77770683535604
<SOS> `` what a question ! <EOS>	43.326130745385086
<SOS> now , do you know , baron , i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it ; as if all the world did not know who the countess g was . '' <EOS>	72.19243929355545
<SOS> `` ah , to be sure , '' replied château renaud ; `` the lovely venetian , is it not ? '' <EOS>	78.69142801920223
<SOS> `` herself . '' <EOS>	67.61960907420111
<SOS> at this moment the countess perceived albert , and returned his salutation with a smile . <EOS>	58.401378397843786
<SOS> `` you know her , it seems ? '' <EOS>	63.00028193869321
<SOS> said château renaud . <EOS>	63.19999431156973
<SOS> `` franz introduced me to her at rome , '' replied albert . <EOS>	72.65137742629807
<SOS> `` well , then , will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome ? '' <EOS>	76.34347005941612
<SOS> `` with pleasure . '' <EOS>	101.69911963542299
<SOS> there was a cry of `` shut up ! '' <EOS>	47.02084703031859
<SOS> from the audience . <EOS>	60.977509809142454
<SOS> this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation . <EOS>	72.7413566235128
<SOS> `` the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	71.90578449400687
<SOS> `` today ? '' <EOS>	66.60381597939947
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	86.99351398548582
<SOS> `` bless me , i quite forgot the races . <EOS>	46.99325240461853
<SOS> did you bet ? '' <EOS>	82.86016891381855
<SOS> `` oh , merely a paltry fifty louis . '' <EOS>	97.62069814606434
<SOS> `` and who was the winner ? '' <EOS>	105.38317084641702
<SOS> `` nautilus . <EOS>	81.95925207980561
<SOS> i staked on him . '' <EOS>	42.3314555540635
<SOS> `` but there were three races , were there not ? '' <EOS>	76.02418250538534
<SOS> `` yes ; there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup , you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race . '' <EOS>	71.57616909950177
<SOS> `` what was it ? '' <EOS>	61.5114422363009
<SOS> `` oh , shut up ! '' <EOS>	69.02525507562429
<SOS> again interposed some of the audience . <EOS>	49.25468658823851
<SOS> `` why , it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course . '' <EOS>	75.77514007965756
<SOS> `` is that possible ? '' <EOS>	46.6194070845249
<SOS> `` true as day . <EOS>	102.33869056942024
<SOS> the fact was , nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa , or that of a jockey styled job , when , at the last moment , a splendid roan , mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist , presented themselves at the starting post . <EOS>	64.66809741520359
<SOS> they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider 's pockets , to make him weight ; but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare , against whom he ran , by at least three whole lengths . '' <EOS>	99.06419884225797
<SOS> `` and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged ? '' <EOS>	47.1461883978405
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	56.72378438569841
<SOS> `` you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa ? '' <EOS>	69.84916951956357
<SOS> `` exactly ; that was the title . '' <EOS>	58.69547719131726
<SOS> `` then , '' answered albert , `` i am better informed than you are , and know who the owner of that horse was . '' <EOS>	96.86073612030918
<SOS> `` shut up , there ! '' <EOS>	42.629863704763814
<SOS> cried the pit in chorus . <EOS>	47.68312168110031
<SOS> and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given , betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived , for the first time , that the mandate was addressed to them . <EOS>	76.21364416653579
<SOS> leisurely turning round , they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them , as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence ; but as no one responded to the challenge , the friends turned again to the front of the theatre , and affected to busy themselves with the stage . <EOS>	80.7246927493811
<SOS> at this moment the door of the minister 's box opened , and madame danglars , accompanied by her daughter , entered , escorted by lucien debray , who assiduously conducted them to their seats . <EOS>	94.61896462663562
<SOS> `` ha , ha , '' said château renaud , `` here come some friends of yours , viscount ! <EOS>	86.11179127907877
<SOS> what are you looking at there ? <EOS>	106.58629633627945
<SOS> do n't you see they are trying to catch your eye ? '' <EOS>	88.497713307248
<SOS> albert turned round , just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness ; as for mademoiselle eugénie , she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage . <EOS>	54.419527787833296
<SOS> `` i tell you what , my dear fellow , '' said château renaud , `` i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is , setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank , which by the way i do n't think you care very much about . <EOS>	62.99721409427759
<SOS> now , barring all that , i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl ! '' <EOS>	89.33811793493624
<SOS> `` handsome , certainly , '' replied albert , `` but not to my taste , which i confess , inclines to something softer , gentler , and more feminine . '' <EOS>	59.11425462066515
<SOS> `` ah , well , '' exclaimed château renaud , who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend , `` you young people are never satisfied ; why , what would you have more ? <EOS>	57.13456145386959
<SOS> your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana , the huntress , and yet you are not content . '' <EOS>	98.74638355286996
<SOS> `` no , for that very resemblance affrights me ; i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua ; but this chase loving diana , continually surrounded by her nymphs , gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon . '' <EOS>	57.5573538446541
<SOS> and , indeed , it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf 's remark . <EOS>	61.41110480091921
<SOS> she was beautiful , but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste ; her hair was raven black , but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious ; her eyes , of the same color as her hair , were surmounted by well arched brows , whose great defect , however , consisted in an almost habitual frown , while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno . <EOS>	66.01501165076274
<SOS> her mouth , which might have been found fault with as too large , displayed teeth of pearly whiteness , rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips , contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion . <EOS>	75.37389595593133
<SOS> but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste , was a dark mole , of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are , placed just at the corner of her mouth ; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance . <EOS>	64.93270169536548
<SOS> the rest of mademoiselle eugénie 's person was in perfect keeping with the head just described ; she , indeed , reminded one of diana , as château renaud observed , but her bearing was more haughty and resolute . <EOS>	88.276403210106
<SOS> as regarded her attainments , the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty , that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person . <EOS>	99.02376685255092
<SOS> she was a perfect linguist , a first rate artist , wrote poetry , and composed music ; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted , following it with an indefatigable perseverance , assisted by a schoolfellow , a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer . <EOS>	52.903564399786134
<SOS> it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day , who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice , which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence . <EOS>	66.11302570971245
<SOS> but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life ; and acting upon this principle , the banker 's daughter , though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d'armilly ( that was the name of the young virtuosa ) to practice with her through the day , took especial care not to be seen in her company . <EOS>	41.17704495134577
<SOS> still , though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend , louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess . <EOS>	80.31907847056189
<SOS> the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box , the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hour 's interval allowed between the acts , and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies , or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes . <EOS>	46.98074705216562
<SOS> morcerf and château renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission . <EOS>	109.754533348654
<SOS> for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party , and she whispered her expectations to her daughter , that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them . <EOS>	60.34662571593804
<SOS> mademoiselle eugénie , however , merely returned a dissenting movement of the head , while , with a cold smile , she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle , in which sat the countess g , and where morcerf had just made his appearance . <EOS>	98.44104376610116
<SOS> < num > m `` so we meet again , my travelling friend , do we ? '' <EOS>	115.56206003468151
<SOS> cried the countess , extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance ; `` it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly , and still more so to bestow your first visit on me . '' <EOS>	61.83637045873774
<SOS> `` be assured , '' replied albert , `` that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris , and had known your address , i should have paid my respects to you before this . <EOS>	76.1730344874007
<SOS> allow me to introduce my friend , baron de château renaud , one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france , and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars , yesterday . '' <EOS>	73.34219988741467
<SOS> château renaud bowed to the countess . <EOS>	78.97220237080289
<SOS> `` so you were at the races , baron ? '' <EOS>	77.95324505176437
<SOS> inquired the countess eagerly . <EOS>	63.9343881793597
<SOS> `` yes , madame . '' <EOS>	87.36226323071942
<SOS> `` well , then , '' pursued madame g with considerable animation , `` you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes ? '' <EOS>	59.748403253603335
<SOS> `` i am sorry to say i can not , '' replied the baron ; `` and i was just asking the same question of albert . '' <EOS>	56.613254461780016
<SOS> `` are you very anxious to know , countess ? '' <EOS>	87.60900076967526
<SOS> asked albert . <EOS>	87.12918610246625
<SOS> `` to know what ? '' <EOS>	82.79287481669353
<SOS> `` the name of the owner of the winning horse ? '' <EOS>	110.52535494935992
<SOS> `` excessively ; only imagine but do tell me , viscount , whether you really are acquainted with it or no ? '' <EOS>	67.46764363582133
<SOS> `` i beg your pardon , madame , but you were about to relate some story , were you not ? <EOS>	106.75674609779803
<SOS> you said , 'only imagine , ' and then paused . <EOS>	83.16253770141128
<SOS> pray continue . '' <EOS>	80.8392758486758
<SOS> `` well , then , listen . <EOS>	95.99155287037021
<SOS> you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse , with his elegant little rider , so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap , that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake ; and when i saw them outstrip all the others , and come to the winning post in such gallant style , i actually clapped my hands with joy . <EOS>	85.94466015221897
<SOS> imagine my surprise , when , upon returning home , the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket ! <EOS>	42.65575013015531
<SOS> i concluded that , by some singular chance , the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself ; but , as i entered my apartments , i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider . <EOS>	94.89604316120878
<SOS> inside the cup was a small piece of paper , on which were written these words 'from lord ruthven to countess g . ' '' <EOS>	62.63239535476219
<SOS> `` precisely ; i was sure of it , '' said morcerf . <EOS>	58.239837630288434
<SOS> `` sure of what ? '' <EOS>	67.25901796995274
<SOS> `` that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself . '' <EOS>	53.35004016177074
<SOS> `` what lord ruthven do you mean ? '' <EOS>	70.4300632188236
<SOS> `` why , our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina ! '' <EOS>	59.14601956397038
<SOS> `` is it possible ? '' <EOS>	70.04208825659477
<SOS> exclaimed the countess ; `` is he here in paris ? '' <EOS>	64.1758862807559
<SOS> `` to be sure , why not ? '' <EOS>	67.74291635709298
<SOS> `` and you visit him ? <EOS>	86.03689054282489
<SOS> meet him at your own house and elsewhere ? '' <EOS>	62.54464305969743
<SOS> `` i assure you he is my most intimate friend , and m. de château renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance . '' <EOS>	108.72578345229141
<SOS> `` but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize ? '' <EOS>	44.6829586214927
<SOS> `` was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa ? '' <EOS>	83.90454779414296
<SOS> `` what of that ? '' <EOS>	94.68200463610395
<SOS> `` why , do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner ? '' <EOS>	68.2185418900767
<SOS> `` oh , yes . '' <EOS>	49.7579862637065
<SOS> `` and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner ? '' <EOS>	68.70237053578296
<SOS> `` to be sure , i remember it all now . '' <EOS>	56.24898003577619
<SOS> `` he called himself vampa . <EOS>	87.5516385022433
<SOS> you see , it 's evident where the count got the name . '' <EOS>	79.1885587339716
<SOS> `` but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me ? '' <EOS>	79.17125640741665
<SOS> `` in the first place , because i had spoken much of you to him , as you may believe ; and in the second , because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success . '' <EOS>	65.10042075097196
<SOS> `` i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him ? '' <EOS>	78.65930653410828
<SOS> `` i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not . <EOS>	49.80129631659498
<SOS> besides , his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven `` `` oh , but that is dreadful ! <EOS>	53.2218771976429
<SOS> why , the man must owe me a fearful grudge . '' <EOS>	89.85745870398927
<SOS> `` does his action appear like that of an enemy ? '' <EOS>	68.02337277720272
<SOS> `` no ; certainly not . '' <EOS>	96.31469590880067
<SOS> `` well , then `` `` and so he is in paris ? '' <EOS>	83.85154388541412
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	93.7201133404506
<SOS> `` and what effect does he produce ? '' <EOS>	63.987408440464684
<SOS> `` why , '' said albert , `` he was talked about for a week ; then the coronation of the queen of england took place , followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars 's diamonds ; and so people talked of something else . '' <EOS>	80.59027063775987
<SOS> `` my good fellow , '' said château renaud , `` the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly . <EOS>	76.40740803109561
<SOS> do not believe what albert is telling you , countess ; so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated , i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever . <EOS>	53.90901421198231
<SOS> his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses , worth < num > , < num > francs , to madame danglars ; his second , the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort 's life ; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club . <EOS>	48.09544846136336
<SOS> i therefore maintain , in spite of morcerf , that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment , but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which , after all , may be his ordinary mode of existence . '' <EOS>	68.1663839263166
<SOS> `` perhaps you are right , '' said morcerf ; `` meanwhile , who is in the russian ambassador 's box ? '' <EOS>	85.34735520392944
<SOS> `` which box do you mean ? '' <EOS>	63.00978700095533
<SOS> asked the countess . <EOS>	59.710719222922236
<SOS> `` the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh . '' <EOS>	81.19887575180996
<SOS> `` did you observe anyone during the first act ? '' <EOS>	72.82071066710726
<SOS> asked château renaud . <EOS>	106.62859685532845
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	56.05057311154798
<SOS> `` in that box . '' <EOS>	95.85314750954224
<SOS> `` no , '' replied the countess , `` it was certainly empty during the first act ; '' then , resuming the subject of their previous conversation , she said , `` and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize ? '' <EOS>	119.09922888434274
<SOS> `` i am sure of it . '' <EOS>	74.01093505247866
<SOS> `` and who afterwards sent the cup to me ? '' <EOS>	94.23974747506718
<SOS> `` undoubtedly . '' <EOS>	89.4972255469857
<SOS> `` but i do n't know him , '' said the countess ; `` i have a great mind to return it . '' <EOS>	67.9525418939453
<SOS> `` do no such thing , i beg of you ; he would only send you another , formed of a magnificent sapphire , or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby . <EOS>	47.01638824432161
<SOS> it is his way , and you must take him as you find him . '' <EOS>	67.40395803364176
<SOS> at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act . <EOS>	63.015605237203644
<SOS> albert rose to return to his place . <EOS>	60.334354538395345
<SOS> `` shall i see you again ? '' <EOS>	81.81361586083158
<SOS> asked the countess . <EOS>	63.865097445474895
<SOS> `` at the end of the next act , with your permission , i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris ? '' <EOS>	69.49151039744902
<SOS> `` pray take notice , '' said the countess , `` that my present residence is < num > rue de rivoli , and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening . <EOS>	52.63278629917959
<SOS> so now , you are both forewarned . '' <EOS>	61.647983527451615
<SOS> the young men bowed , and quitted the box . <EOS>	77.3256235789793
<SOS> upon reaching their stalls , they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador . <EOS>	79.06876413489965
<SOS> a man of from thirty five to forty years of age , dressed in deep black , had just entered , accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style . <EOS>	59.93374834883465
<SOS> the lady was surpassingly beautiful , while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her . <EOS>	52.160515181341474
<SOS> `` hullo , '' said albert ; `` it is monte cristo and his greek ! '' <EOS>	105.55340250588988
<SOS> the strangers were , indeed , no other than the count and haydée . <EOS>	91.10529674903032
<SOS> in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house , and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds . <EOS>	80.48634020290916
<SOS> the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred ; all eyes , all thoughts , were occupied with the young and beautiful woman , whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle . <EOS>	59.02885935154799
<SOS> upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act , and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given . <EOS>	80.7164645589862
<SOS> at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness . <EOS>	89.76871000866801
<SOS> having bowed to the two ladies , he extended his hand to debray . <EOS>	71.24070167283487
<SOS> by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed , while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness . <EOS>	44.008691100728676
<SOS> `` my dear fellow , '' said debray , `` you have come in the nick of time . <EOS>	51.178668788839076
<SOS> there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count ; she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth , education , and parentage , where he came from , and whither he is going . <EOS>	66.14216769383275
<SOS> being no disciple of cagliostro , i was wholly unable to do this ; so , by way of getting out of the scrape , i said , 'ask morcerf ; he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ' ends ; ' whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you . '' <EOS>	71.02189657725533
<SOS> `` is it not almost incredible , '' said madame danglars , `` that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command , should possess so little information ? '' <EOS>	57.40893698175633
<SOS> `` let me assure you , madame , '' said lucien , `` that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal , i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo , whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob . <EOS>	71.14891891844722
<SOS> however , i have turned the business over to morcerf , so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you ; for my own part , i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings . '' <EOS>	81.50708597495516
<SOS> < num > m `` i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth < num > , < num > francs , wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at < num > , < num > francs each . '' <EOS>	87.42832986483347
<SOS> `` he seems to have a mania for diamonds , '' said morcerf , smiling , `` and i verily believe that , like potemkin , he keeps his pockets filled , for the sake of strewing them along the road , as tom thumb did his flint stones . '' <EOS>	56.96866298771686
<SOS> `` perhaps he has discovered some mine , '' said madame danglars . <EOS>	44.35830686591263
<SOS> `` i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron 's banking establishment ? '' <EOS>	96.78297894909714
<SOS> `` i was not aware of it , '' replied albert , `` but i can readily believe it . '' <EOS>	85.21622519251738
<SOS> `` and , further , that he stated to m. danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris , during which time he proposed to spend six millions . <EOS>	71.73690050604185
<SOS> `` he must be the shah of persia , travelling incog . '' <EOS>	62.01246502112587
<SOS> `` have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman , m . <EOS>	56.453003953837744
<SOS> lucien ? '' <EOS>	59.38160920350103
<SOS> inquired eugénie . <EOS>	77.53580273124258
<SOS> `` i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself , '' responded lucien , raising his lorgnette to his eye . <EOS>	67.97818794574236
<SOS> `` a most lovely creature , upon my soul ! '' <EOS>	76.57304785345798
<SOS> was his verdict . <EOS>	66.6869858239838
<SOS> `` who is this young person , m. de morcerf ? '' <EOS>	43.38900763016612
<SOS> inquired eugénie ; `` does anybody know ? '' <EOS>	74.0637536095954
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , '' said albert , replying to this direct appeal , `` i can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek . '' <EOS>	69.34028181145442
<SOS> `` so i should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as well informed as yourself . '' <EOS>	87.72839576371426
<SOS> `` i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone , '' replied morcerf , `` but i am reluctantly obliged to confess , i have nothing further to communicate yes , stay , i do know one thing more , namely , that she is a musician , for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count , i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own . '' <EOS>	52.22631121196941
<SOS> `` then your count entertains visitors , does he ? '' <EOS>	47.99575595048151
<SOS> asked madame danglars . <EOS>	55.4908362539256
<SOS> `` indeed he does , and in a most lavish manner , i can assure you . '' <EOS>	76.54946284127072
<SOS> `` i must try and persuade m. danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner , or something of the sort , that he may be compelled to ask us in return . '' <EOS>	78.5648099676596
<SOS> `` what , '' said debray , laughing ; `` do you really mean you would go to his house ? '' <EOS>	109.85855609076742
<SOS> `` why not ? <EOS>	84.88378225469467
<SOS> my husband could accompany me . '' <EOS>	74.44811914703332
<SOS> `` but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor ? '' <EOS>	53.91569191117966
<SOS> `` you have ample proof to the contrary , if you look opposite , '' said the baroness , as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek . <EOS>	79.36057791883061
<SOS> `` no , no ! '' <EOS>	63.27497842633468
<SOS> exclaimed debray ; `` that girl is not his wife : he told us himself she was his slave . <EOS>	62.104496541493035
<SOS> do you not recollect , morcerf , his telling us so at your breakfast ? '' <EOS>	90.95360790055084
<SOS> `` well , then , '' said the baroness , `` if slave she be , she has all the air and manner of a princess . '' <EOS>	70.53402515726393
<SOS> `` of the 'arabian nights ' . '' <EOS>	54.631939771738
<SOS> `` if you like ; but tell me , my dear lucien , what it is that constitutes a princess . <EOS>	102.22128497494407
<SOS> why , diamonds and she is covered with them . '' <EOS>	74.41373921521213
<SOS> `` to me she seems overloaded , '' observed eugénie ; `` she would look far better if she wore fewer , and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists . '' <EOS>	50.031139315854546
<SOS> `` see how the artist peeps out ! '' <EOS>	114.83121570366502
<SOS> exclaimed madame danglars . <EOS>	65.8467657851769
<SOS> `` my poor eugénie , you must conceal your passion for the fine arts . '' <EOS>	55.213108985737115
<SOS> `` i admire all that is beautiful , '' returned the young lady . <EOS>	61.019176958987124
<SOS> `` what do you think of the count ? '' <EOS>	77.52713590691091
<SOS> inquired debray ; `` he is not much amiss , according to my ideas of good looks . '' <EOS>	78.73145070358629
<SOS> `` the count , '' repeated eugénie , as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner ; `` the count ? <EOS>	84.9037084094409
<SOS> oh , he is so dreadfully pale . '' <EOS>	89.96769498913768
<SOS> `` i quite agree with you , '' said morcerf ; `` and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out . <EOS>	75.87606861678759
<SOS> the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire . '' <EOS>	81.84111141416996
<SOS> `` then the countess g has returned to paris , has she ? '' <EOS>	103.3462164652289
<SOS> inquired the baroness . <EOS>	100.62034211340273
<SOS> `` is that she , mamma ? '' <EOS>	102.57921309741383
<SOS> asked eugénie ; `` almost opposite to us , with that profusion of beautiful light hair ? '' <EOS>	84.6415889607959
<SOS> `` yes , '' said madame danglars , `` that is she . <EOS>	68.25485219518785
<SOS> shall i tell you what you ought to do , morcerf ? '' <EOS>	94.24252182809964
<SOS> `` command me , madame . '' <EOS>	79.59232482172308
<SOS> `` well , then , you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us . '' <EOS>	86.06734125951638
<SOS> `` what for ? '' <EOS>	62.39910754393594
<SOS> asked eugénie . <EOS>	46.67089108370218
<SOS> `` what for ? <EOS>	113.49988694691284
<SOS> why , to converse with him , of course . <EOS>	119.78386342660329
<SOS> have you really no desire to meet him ? '' <EOS>	107.83498388238546
<SOS> `` none whatever , '' replied eugénie . <EOS>	70.1787997342417
<SOS> `` strange child , '' murmured the baroness . <EOS>	75.85135328917512
<SOS> `` he will very probably come of his own accord , '' said morcerf . <EOS>	41.76242186036596
<SOS> `` there ; do you see , madame , he recognizes you , and bows . '' <EOS>	77.89328567015409
<SOS> the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner . <EOS>	55.26431937339265
<SOS> `` well , '' said morcerf , `` i may as well be magnanimous , and tear myself away to forward your wishes . <EOS>	111.84610472824758
<SOS> adieu ; i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him . '' <EOS>	98.7730748485461
<SOS> `` go straight to his box ; that will be the simplest plan . '' <EOS>	75.81038644126039
