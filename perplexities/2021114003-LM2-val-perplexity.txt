<SOS> the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain . <EOS>	79.39580215842574

<SOS> the third act had begun ; and during its progress the count of morcerf , according to his promise , made his appearance in the box of madame danglars . <EOS>	75.72655205206266
<SOS> the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement ; his presence , therefore , was wholly unnoticed , save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself . <EOS>	87.24716343181495
<SOS> the quick eye of monte cristo however , marked his coming ; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips . <EOS>	87.9849946282152
<SOS> haydée , whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage , like all unsophisticated natures , delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear . <EOS>	59.4319423507154
<SOS> < num > m the third act passed off as usual . <EOS>	73.84540350106361
<SOS> mesdemoiselles noblet , julia , and leroux executed the customary pirouettes ; robert duly challenged the prince of granada ; and the royal father of the princess isabella , taking his daughter by the hand , swept round the stage with majestic strides , the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle . <EOS>	90.38713913848093
<SOS> after which the curtain again fell , and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon . <EOS>	98.74183183726123
<SOS> the count left his box , and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars , who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise . <EOS>	68.6966240485193
<SOS> `` you are welcome , count ! '' <EOS>	108.23762498887815

<SOS> `` was it ali , '' asked the count of morcerf , `` who rescued my son from the hands of bandits ? '' <EOS>	97.08103971427774
<SOS> `` no , count , '' replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general ; `` in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks ; but you have already tendered them , and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject . <EOS>	106.44522266931423
<SOS> may i beg of you , baroness , to honor me with an introduction to your daughter ? '' <EOS>	77.95694491303247
<SOS> `` oh , you are no stranger at least not by name , '' replied madame danglars , `` and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you . <EOS>	62.22034877195044
<SOS> eugénie , '' continued the baroness , turning towards her daughter , `` this is the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	82.30406983112714
<SOS> the count bowed , while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly . <EOS>	55.88246507709484
<SOS> `` you have a charming young person with you tonight , count , '' said eugénie . <EOS>	87.56577331135165
<SOS> `` is she your daughter ? '' <EOS>	75.68662043002487
<SOS> `` no , mademoiselle , '' said monte cristo , astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question . <EOS>	94.66605318854376
<SOS> `` she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care . '' <EOS>	91.31615840170012
<SOS> `` and what is her name ? '' <EOS>	77.81795608899272
<SOS> `` haydée , '' replied monte cristo . <EOS>	89.39967577635525
<SOS> `` a greek ? '' <EOS>	90.04112672680544
<SOS> murmured the count of morcerf . <EOS>	100.30242190428756
<SOS> `` yes , indeed , count , '' said madame danglars ; `` and tell me , did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini , whom you so gloriously and valiantly served , a more exquisite beauty or richer costume ? '' <EOS>	83.25354009305299
<SOS> `` did i hear rightly , monsieur , '' said monte cristo `` that you served at yanina ? '' <EOS>	89.1299666144427
<SOS> `` i was inspector general of the pasha 's troops , '' replied morcerf ; `` and it is no secret that i owe my fortune , such as it is , to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief . '' <EOS>	107.6260696932298
<SOS> `` but look ! '' <EOS>	83.89708728234548
<SOS> exclaimed madame danglars . <EOS>	95.57353657827801
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	95.39821372836934
<SOS> stammered morcerf . <EOS>	93.31071478927639
<SOS> `` there , '' said monte cristo placing his arms around the count , and leaning with him over the front of the box , just as haydée , whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian , perceived his pale features close to morcerf 's face . <EOS>	87.56746161709262
<SOS> it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa . <EOS>	111.18000004228256
<SOS> she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw , then , uttering a faint cry , threw herself back in her seat . <EOS>	117.69482332811899
<SOS> the sound was heard by the people about ali , who instantly opened the box door . <EOS>	68.56553254819366
<SOS> `` why , count , '' exclaimed eugénie , `` what has happened to your ward ? <EOS>	94.1429742710573
<SOS> she seems to have been taken suddenly ill. `` very probably , '' answered the count . <EOS>	72.80770936785201
<SOS> `` but do not be alarmed on her account . <EOS>	89.33356223714448
<SOS> haydée 's nervous system is delicately organized , and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay , there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence . <EOS>	83.85761460825316
<SOS> however , '' continued monte cristo , drawing a small phial from his pocket , `` i have an infallible remedy . '' <EOS>	68.78101277315533
<SOS> so saying , he bowed to the baroness and her daughter , exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count , and left madame danglars ' box . <EOS>	62.54510697771497
<SOS> upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale . <EOS>	92.16999049099856
<SOS> as soon as she saw him she seized his hand ; her own hands were moist and icy cold . <EOS>	100.29256413940716
<SOS> `` who was it you were talking with over there ? '' <EOS>	75.69683011431587
<SOS> she asked . <EOS>	95.29166295908405
<SOS> `` with the count of morcerf , '' answered monte cristo . <EOS>	88.54373054908437
<SOS> `` he tells me he served your illustrious father , and that he owes his fortune to him . '' <EOS>	81.03331283511167
<SOS> `` wretch ! '' <EOS>	107.07829914198545
<SOS> exclaimed haydée , her eyes flashing with rage ; `` he sold my father to the turks , and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery ! <EOS>	67.63376963251632
<SOS> did not you know that , my dear lord ? '' <EOS>	71.80101422667575
<SOS> `` something of this i heard in epirus , '' said monte cristo ; `` but the particulars are still unknown to me . <EOS>	77.41307132722797
<SOS> you shall relate them to me , my child . <EOS>	66.56804101485025
<SOS> they are , no doubt , both curious and interesting . '' <EOS>	95.21183148610989
<SOS> `` yes , yes ; but let us go . <EOS>	116.05819600475141
<SOS> i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man . '' <EOS>	60.173257358957976
<SOS> so saying , haydée arose , and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral , she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act . <EOS>	110.68313781819367
<SOS> `` do you observe , '' said the countess g to albert , who had returned to her side , `` that man does nothing like other people ; he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable , and when the fourth begins , takes his departure . '' <EOS>	59.351501655482345
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	92.85226437344832
<SOS> a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting , albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées , which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count 's princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences . <EOS>	102.83896125685754
<SOS> he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter , signed `` baronne danglars , née hermine de servieux . '' <EOS>	66.91323836074532
<SOS> albert was accompanied by lucien debray , who , joining in his friend 's conversation , added some passing compliments , the source of which the count 's talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess . <EOS>	79.3037534208213
<SOS> he was convinced that lucien 's visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity , the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d'antin . <EOS>	77.62723822429616
<SOS> in short , madame danglars , not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth < num > , < num > francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money , had deputed those eyes , by which she was accustomed to see , to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person . <EOS>	106.40460011367496
<SOS> but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien 's visit and the curiosity of the baroness . <EOS>	86.80874672371716
<SOS> `` you are in constant communication with the baron danglars ? '' <EOS>	63.29787336962085
<SOS> the count inquired of albert de morcerf . <EOS>	111.0422061861012
<SOS> `` yes , count , you know what i told you ? '' <EOS>	80.15787279967637
<SOS> `` all remains the same , then , in that quarter ? '' <EOS>	91.387581678413
<SOS> `` it is more than ever a settled thing , '' said lucien , and , considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make , he adjusted the glass to his eye , and biting the top of his gold headed cane , began to make the tour of the apartment , examining the arms and the pictures . <EOS>	101.17098005618129
<SOS> `` ah , '' said monte cristo `` i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded . '' <EOS>	100.94589818903115
<SOS> `` oh , things take their course without our assistance . <EOS>	110.87204843632962
<SOS> while we are forgetting them , they are falling into their appointed order ; and when , again , our attention is directed to them , we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end . <EOS>	78.94289500891894
<SOS> my father and m. danglars served together in spain , my father in the army and m. danglars in the commissariat department . <EOS>	66.93758544450982
<SOS> it was there that my father , ruined by the revolution , and m. danglars , who never had possessed any patrimony , both laid the foundations of their different fortunes . '' <EOS>	100.436867126989
<SOS> `` yes , '' said monte cristo `` i think m. danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him ; and , '' continued he , casting a side glance at lucien , who was turning over the leaves of an album , `` mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name . '' <EOS>	83.84056146827913
<SOS> `` very pretty , or rather , very beautiful , '' replied albert , `` but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate ; i am an ungrateful fellow . '' <EOS>	122.97761746884372
<SOS> `` you speak as if you were already her husband . '' <EOS>	83.83742226320867
<SOS> `` ah , '' returned albert , in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing . <EOS>	65.92594011139211
<SOS> `` really , '' said monte cristo , lowering his voice , `` you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage . '' <EOS>	65.4458224248349
<SOS> `` mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me , '' replied morcerf , `` and that frightens me . '' <EOS>	99.64749863194214
<SOS> `` bah , '' exclaimed monte cristo , `` that 's a fine reason to give . <EOS>	85.44979434301985
<SOS> are you not rich yourself ? '' <EOS>	98.58910172745054
<SOS> `` my father 's income is about < num > , < num > francs per annum ; and he will give me , perhaps , ten or twelve thousand when i marry . '' <EOS>	78.38250554268369
<SOS> `` that , perhaps , might not be considered a large sum , in paris especially , '' said the count ; `` but everything does not depend on wealth , and it is a fine thing to have a good name , and to occupy a high station in society . <EOS>	97.54263129417801
<SOS> your name is celebrated , your position magnificent ; and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier , and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin ; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine . <EOS>	87.80833474676575
<SOS> as for me , i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one ; she will enrich you , and you will ennoble her . '' <EOS>	100.3549483622981
<SOS> albert shook his head , and looked thoughtful . <EOS>	81.2064909086319
<SOS> `` there is still something else , '' said he . <EOS>	72.22172359972923
<SOS> `` i confess , '' observed monte cristo , `` that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful . '' <EOS>	62.38434136206919
<SOS> `` oh , '' said morcerf , `` this repugnance , if repugnance it may be called , is not all on my side . '' <EOS>	74.85339600854532
<SOS> `` whence can it arise , then ? <EOS>	78.7016270348007
<SOS> for you told me your father desired the marriage . '' <EOS>	77.50748460340014
<SOS> `` it is my mother who dissents ; she has a clear and penetrating judgment , and does not smile on the proposed union . <EOS>	106.71165818498619
<SOS> i can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars . '' <EOS>	75.09630581661449
<SOS> < num > m `` ah , '' said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , `` that may be easily explained ; the comtesse de morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough . '' <EOS>	72.98823183925084
<SOS> `` i do not know if that is her reason , '' said albert , `` but one thing i do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable . <EOS>	96.85494090980399
<SOS> there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair ; but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition `` `` real ? '' <EOS>	67.96085757227414
<SOS> interrupted the count , smiling . <EOS>	99.65946605861751
<SOS> `` oh , real enough , from anxiety doubtless , at any rate they postponed the matter for two months . <EOS>	79.62562178466804

<SOS> `` oh , it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars . '' <EOS>	99.48592149299405
<SOS> `` marry her then , '' said the count , with a significant shrug of the shoulders . <EOS>	111.28234063646171
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied morcerf , `` but that will plunge my mother into positive grief . '' <EOS>	83.04301348794705

<SOS> i think , rather than give pain to my dear mother , i would run the risk of offending the count . '' <EOS>	70.76654438493482
<SOS> monte cristo turned away ; he seemed moved by this last remark . <EOS>	61.613208409554495
<SOS> `` ah , '' said he to debray , who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon , and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left , `` what are you doing there ? <EOS>	106.48297744729916
<SOS> are you making a sketch after poussin ? '' <EOS>	87.41079026015008
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' was the tranquil response ; `` i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort . <EOS>	90.45239135904303

<SOS> `` yes ; i am calculating by the way , morcerf , that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds ; from < num > they have risen to < num > in three days , and the prudent banker had purchased at < num > ; therefore he must have made < num > , < num > livres .

<SOS> `` that is not his biggest scoop , '' said morcerf ; `` did he not make a million in spaniards this last year ? '' <EOS>	111.17761361492748
<SOS> `` my dear fellow , '' said lucien , `` here is the count of monte cristo , who will say to you , as the italians do , `` 'denaro e santità , metà della metà . <EOS>	89.1389188492233

<SOS> `` but you who are a reasonable being , lucien , and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news , since you are at the fountain head , surely you ought to prevent it , '' said morcerf , with a smile . <EOS>	81.34222073913433
<SOS> `` how can i , if her husband fails in controlling her ? '' <EOS>	101.48136979056481

<SOS> lucien half smiled . <EOS>	96.85511639528069
<SOS> monte cristo , although apparently indifferent , had not lost one word of this conversation , and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary . <EOS>	99.92554750241808
<SOS> this embarrassment had completely escaped albert , but it caused lucien to shorten his visit ; he was evidently ill at ease . <EOS>	96.01228565797926
<SOS> the count , in taking leave of him , said something in a low voice , to which he answered , `` willingly , count ; i accept . '' <EOS>	75.70665100286848
<SOS> the count returned to young morcerf . <EOS>	74.04624128664884

<SOS> `` so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house , and my mother , has not , i think , visited madame danglars twice in her whole life . '' <EOS>	112.21731247334164
<SOS> `` then , '' said the count , `` i am emboldened to speak openly to you . <EOS>	73.46999916879193
<SOS> m. danglars is my banker ; m. de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him . <EOS>	99.7293709574776

<SOS> if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner , i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting , or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light , especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter . <EOS>	89.14801872666987
<SOS> in that case your mother would hold me in aversion , and i do not at all wish that ; on the contrary , i desire to stand high in her esteem . '' <EOS>	97.16615004050463

<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	91.22337565294956
<SOS> major cavalcanti both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major , which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert 's invitation . <EOS>	75.7286440350884
<SOS> seven o'clock had just struck , and m. bertuccio , according to the command which had been given him , had two hours before left for auteuil , when a cab stopped at the door , and after depositing its occupant at the gate , immediately hurried away , as if ashamed of its employment . <EOS>	81.48746959875419
<SOS> the visitor was about fifty two years of age , dressed in one of the green surtouts , ornamented with black frogs , which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe . <EOS>	108.89771526530656
<SOS> he wore trousers of blue cloth , boots tolerably clean , but not of the brightest polish , and a little too thick in the soles , buckskin gloves , a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes , and a black cravat striped with white , which , if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will , might have passed for a halter , so much did it resemble one . <EOS>	82.59617041730853
<SOS> such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate , and demanded if it was not at no . <EOS>	122.79821178792214
<SOS> < num > in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived , and who , being answered by the porter in the affirmative , entered , closed the gate after him , and began to ascend the steps . <EOS>	106.88912423960969
<SOS> the small and angular head of this man , his white hair and thick gray moustaches , caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin , who had received an exact description of the expected visitor , and who was awaiting him in the hall . <EOS>	111.08477197594434
<SOS> therefore , scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival . <EOS>	88.17402040432336
<SOS> he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room , and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air . <EOS>	61.07973343364479
<SOS> `` ah , my dear sir , you are most welcome ; i was expecting you . '' <EOS>	67.49774986697096

<SOS> `` it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o'clock this evening ? '' <EOS>	74.85870038059524
<SOS> `` i will prove it to you beyond a doubt . '' <EOS>	81.75737823388131
<SOS> `` oh , no , never mind that , '' said the italian ; `` it is not worth the trouble . '' <EOS>	75.92921381104289
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	60.26848394275623
<SOS> his visitor appeared slightly uneasy . <EOS>	103.76265132154157
<SOS> `` let me see , '' said the count ; `` are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti ? '' <EOS>	121.094950248731

<SOS> `` was i a major ? '' <EOS>	89.76633689676704
<SOS> timidly asked the old soldier . <EOS>	70.16820734659963
<SOS> `` yes , '' said monte cristo `` you were a major ; that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy . '' <EOS>	109.3782603814848
<SOS> `` very good , '' said the major , `` i do not demand more , you understand `` `` your visit here today is not of your own suggestion , is it ? '' <EOS>	108.92853811044701
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	65.1600694654274
<SOS> `` no , certainly not . '' <EOS>	98.69458299989223

<SOS> `` and you have a letter ? '' <EOS>	57.69814208697555
<SOS> `` yes , there it is . '' <EOS>	78.99764397571244
<SOS> `` give it to me , then . '' <EOS>	83.50231554367971
<SOS> and monte cristo took the letter , which he opened and read . <EOS>	64.66590468510377
<SOS> the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes , and then took a survey of the apartment , but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room . <EOS>	62.10141869024531
<SOS> `` yes , yes , i see . <EOS>	58.458506755205384
<SOS> 'major cavalcanti , a worthy patrician of lucca , a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence , ' '' continued monte cristo , reading aloud , `` 'possessing an income of half a million . ' '' <EOS>	67.96058357563936
<SOS> monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper , and bowed . <EOS>	92.45431696865639
<SOS> `` half a million , '' said he , `` magnificent ! '' <EOS>	55.89417837127999
<SOS> `` half a million , is it ? '' <EOS>	75.50844617781246
<SOS> said the major . <EOS>	98.24922007453294
<SOS> `` yes , in so many words ; and it must be so , for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe . '' <EOS>	103.52735484213078
<SOS> `` be it half a million , then ; but on my word of honor , i had no idea that it was so much . '' <EOS>	80.26035659138468
<SOS> `` because you are robbed by your steward . <EOS>	85.95026001161924
<SOS> you must make some reformation in that quarter . '' <EOS>	93.61969505911547
<SOS> `` you have opened my eyes , '' said the italian gravely ; `` i will show the gentlemen the door . '' <EOS>	94.106851012601
<SOS> monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter : `` 'and who only needs one thing more to make him happy . ' '' <EOS>	85.69554193295312
<SOS> `` yes , indeed but one ! '' <EOS>	99.43468343229999
<SOS> said the major with a sigh . <EOS>	94.18427467297566
<SOS> `` 'which is to recover a lost and adored son . ' '' <EOS>	58.410968167089194

<SOS> said the major with a deep sigh , and raising his eye to heaven . <EOS>	82.83821601481314
<SOS> `` unhappy father , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	93.56059138942203
<SOS> the count continued : `` ' i have given him renewed life and hope , in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years . ' '' <EOS>	84.40610270241243
<SOS> the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety . <EOS>	101.42615429245858
<SOS> `` i have the power of so doing , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	87.83436514154798
<SOS> the major recovered his self possession . <EOS>	85.76248554649305
<SOS> `` so , then , '' said he , `` the letter was true to the end ? '' <EOS>	79.902995352191
<SOS> `` did you doubt it , my dear monsieur bartolomeo ? '' <EOS>	108.2951515272828
<SOS> `` no , indeed ; certainly not ; a good man , a man holding religious office , as does the abbé busoni , could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke ; but your excellency has not read all . '' <EOS>	113.8432499178654
<SOS> `` ah , true , '' said monte cristo `` there is a postscript . '' <EOS>	113.97265310003907

<SOS> the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript , apparently with great anxiety . <EOS>	93.54452994044648
<SOS> `` very good , '' said the count . <EOS>	79.29826750632614

<SOS> `` then the postscript `` `` well ; what of the postscript ? '' <EOS>	77.08257838686012

<SOS> you attached great importance , then , to this postscript , my dear monsieur cavalcanti ? '' <EOS>	87.29175266451531
<SOS> `` i must explain to you , '' said the major , `` that , fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni , i had not provided myself with any other funds ; so that if this resource had failed me , i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris . '' <EOS>	93.3904615831365
<SOS> `` is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere ? '' <EOS>	108.62739465300356

<SOS> the major 's eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment . <EOS>	76.09841577714376
<SOS> `` but sit down , '' said monte cristo ; `` really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour . '' <EOS>	72.16629891422974

<SOS> `` now , '' said the count , `` what will you take a glass of sherry , port , or alicante ? '' <EOS>	78.35111353759387

<SOS> `` yes , i will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging . '' <EOS>	97.84810838596347

<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	73.89746213170754

<SOS> baptistin re entered with glasses , wine , and biscuits . <EOS>	112.67420486708443
<SOS> the count filled one glass , but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid . <EOS>	69.89016828994049
<SOS> the bottle was covered with spiders ' webs , and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man 's face . <EOS>	70.57869680636233
<SOS> the major made a wise choice ; he took the full glass and a biscuit . <EOS>	80.91470003782702
<SOS> the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest , who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction , and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine . <EOS>	65.80948296969132

<SOS> `` ah , '' said the major , taking a second biscuit , `` that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting . '' <EOS>	76.86477947387944
<SOS> the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed . <EOS>	74.7067463435853

<SOS> the major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to compose his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an under look at the count , the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity . <EOS>	85.55006879644164
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the major , `` i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye . '' <EOS>	93.99774338926257

<SOS> `` his poor mother , '' murmured the major , trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation , so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear . <EOS>	113.22625587296469

<SOS> `` now , '' replied monte cristo `` there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father 's mind , which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him , how you have been treated by your persecutors , and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank . <EOS>	87.93394418081286
<SOS> finally , he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed , and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering ; he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture ; and , in short , whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you . '' <EOS>	73.32490232993152
<SOS> `` sir ! '' <EOS>	82.51876854617964
<SOS> exclaimed the young man , quite astounded , `` i hope no false report `` `` as for myself , i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore , the philanthropist . <EOS>	78.11971338137643
<SOS> i believe he found you in some unpleasant position , but do not know of what nature , for i did not ask , not being inquisitive . <EOS>	123.0087939907244
<SOS> your misfortunes engaged his sympathies , so you see you must have been interesting . <EOS>	75.31935811076434
<SOS> he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him . <EOS>	64.77963839270024
<SOS> he did seek , and has found him , apparently , since he is here now ; and , finally , my friend apprised me of your coming , and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune . <EOS>	81.50748114732231
<SOS> i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar , but he is sincere , and as rich as a gold mine , consequently , he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him , and i have promised to adhere to his instructions . <EOS>	80.501209582848
<SOS> now , sir , pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you , as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron . <EOS>	78.24031132138253
<SOS> i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control , and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not , in some measure , contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure ? '' <EOS>	106.76966440978927
<SOS> `` sir , '' returned the young man , with a reassurance of manner , `` make your mind easy on this score . <EOS>	91.67093478574829
<SOS> those who took me from my father , and who always intended , sooner or later , to sell me again to my original proprietor , as they have now done , calculated that , in order to make the most of their bargain , it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth , and even to increase the value , if possible . <EOS>	97.44075935664121
<SOS> i have , therefore , received a very good education , and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor , whose masters made them grammarians , doctors , and philosophers , in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market . '' <EOS>	68.96731085516979
<SOS> monte cristo smiled with satisfaction ; it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m. andrea cavalcanti . <EOS>	84.30358530731044
<SOS> `` besides , '' continued the young man , `` if there did appear some defect in education , or offence against the established forms of etiquette , i suppose it would be excused , in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth , and followed me through my youth . '' <EOS>	94.22965542413844
<SOS> `` well , '' said monte cristo in an indifferent tone , `` you will do as you please , count , for you are the master of your own actions , and are the person most concerned in the matter , but if i were you , i would not divulge a word of these adventures . <EOS>	113.58193880635028
<SOS> your history is quite a romance , and the world , which delights in romances in yellow covers , strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment , even though they be gilded like yourself . <EOS>	65.43361514864596
<SOS> this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you , my dear count . <EOS>	97.38809570445927
<SOS> you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world , and be deemed unlikely and unnatural . <EOS>	115.01628446962486
<SOS> you would be no longer a lost child found , but you would be looked upon as an upstart , who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night . <EOS>	89.38699762660015
<SOS> you might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark . '' <EOS>	99.03308447233965
<SOS> `` i agree with you , monsieur , '' said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion , `` such consequences would be extremely unpleasant . '' <EOS>	92.12978885397635
<SOS> `` nevertheless , you must not exaggerate the evil , '' said monte cristo , `` for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another . <EOS>	102.63785638416365
<SOS> you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct , and for a man of your intelligence , this plan is as easy as it is necessary ; you must form honorable friendships , and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life . '' <EOS>	67.66542040122172
<SOS> andrea visibly changed countenance . <EOS>	79.75997512141379
<SOS> `` i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser , '' said monte cristo , `` did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends , and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too ; therefore , in departing from this rule , i should ( as the actors say ) be playing a part quite out of my line , and should , therefore , run the risk of being hissed , which would be an act of folly . '' <EOS>	70.70564478619126
<SOS> `` however , your excellency , '' said andrea , `` in consideration of lord wilmore , by whom i was recommended to you `` `` yes , certainly , '' interrupted monte cristo ; `` but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me , my dear m. andrea , that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one . <EOS>	85.18021267585566
<SOS> ah , '' said the count , watching andrea 's countenance , `` i do not demand any confession from you ; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca . <EOS>	71.41066136545057
<SOS> you shall soon see him . <EOS>	109.80425995606423
<SOS> he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner , and he is disfigured by his uniform ; but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service , all that will be pardoned . <EOS>	71.79970493043633
<SOS> we are not generally very severe with the austrians . <EOS>	114.97975214297023
<SOS> in short , you will find your father a very presentable person , i assure you . '' <EOS>	106.13395175610036
<SOS> `` ah , sir , you have given me confidence ; it is so long since we were separated , that i have not the least remembrance of him , and , besides , you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects . '' <EOS>	83.43447734291989
<SOS> `` he is a millionaire his income is < num > , < num > francs . '' <EOS>	81.26623350419742
<SOS> `` then , '' said the young man , with anxiety , `` i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position . '' <EOS>	75.18739474150523
<SOS> `` one of the most agreeable possible , my dear sir ; he will allow you an income of < num > , < num > livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris . '' <EOS>	62.300985961055574

<SOS> `` you can not control circumstances , my dear sir ; 'man proposes , and god disposes . ' '' <EOS>	87.71563715946647
<SOS> andrea sighed . <EOS>	64.26581882462027
<SOS> `` but , '' said he , `` so long as i do remain in paris , and nothing forces me to quit it , do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me ? '' <EOS>	90.48812390007978
<SOS> `` you may . '' <EOS>	74.75844538279802
<SOS> `` shall i receive it from my father ? '' <EOS>	70.6238616849987
<SOS> asked andrea , with some uneasiness . <EOS>	83.82888337843839
<SOS> `` yes , you will receive it from your father personally , but lord wilmore will be the security for the money . <EOS>	85.61253717822234

<SOS> `` and does my father mean to remain long in paris ? '' <EOS>	73.93902320299304
<SOS> asked andrea . <EOS>	75.31162258734615
<SOS> `` only a few days , '' replied monte cristo . <EOS>	68.93987343283924
<SOS> `` his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together . '' <EOS>	83.35332331683321
<SOS> `` ah , my dear father ! '' <EOS>	67.753022395733
<SOS> exclaimed andrea , evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure . <EOS>	83.5116583504784
<SOS> `` therefore , '' said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning `` therefore i will not , for another instant , retard the pleasure of your meeting . <EOS>	72.51298530895377
<SOS> are you prepared to embrace your worthy father ? '' <EOS>	104.78652470680207
<SOS> `` i hope you do not doubt it . '' <EOS>	107.84860595097474
<SOS> < num > m `` go , then , into the drawing room , my young friend , where you will find your father awaiting you . '' <EOS>	99.69621405694187
<SOS> andrea made a low bow to the count , and entered the adjoining room . <EOS>	72.57128088368138
<SOS> monte cristo watched him till he disappeared , and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture , which , in sliding partly from the frame , discovered to view a small opening , so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea . <EOS>	79.287002005818
<SOS> the young man closed the door behind him , and advanced towards the major , who had risen when he heard steps approaching him . <EOS>	77.7960260990988
<SOS> `` ah , my dear father ! '' <EOS>	96.89457205404106

<SOS> `` how do you do , my dear son ? '' <EOS>	77.8653492685508
<SOS> said the major gravely . <EOS>	88.83125980613251
<SOS> `` after so many years of painful separation , '' said andrea , in the same tone of voice , and glancing towards the door , `` what a happiness it is to meet again ! '' <EOS>	76.54708429133305
<SOS> `` indeed it is , after so long a separation . '' <EOS>	69.23619402493834
<SOS> `` will you not embrace me , sir ? '' <EOS>	90.2257331128612
<SOS> said andrea . <EOS>	55.11130952743401
<SOS> < num > m `` if you wish it , my son , '' said the major ; and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage ; that is to say , each rested his head on the other 's shoulder . <EOS>	56.02296969049133
<SOS> `` then we are once more reunited ? '' <EOS>	63.4677090226329

<SOS> `` once more , '' replied the major . <EOS>	70.6149915333809
<SOS> `` never more to be separated ? '' <EOS>	75.16621486907862
<SOS> `` why , as to that i think , my dear son , you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country . '' <EOS>	68.27278443077977
<SOS> `` the fact is , '' said the young man , `` that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it . '' <EOS>	114.19670366675972
<SOS> `` as for me , you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca ; therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can . '' <EOS>	77.39873707309226
<SOS> `` but before you leave france , my dear father , i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent . '' <EOS>	87.22902721371035
<SOS> `` certainly ; i am come expressly on that account ; it has cost me much trouble to find you , but i had resolved on giving them into your hands , and if i had to recommence my search , it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life . '' <EOS>	104.63989102015465

<SOS> `` here they are . '' <EOS>	91.68969625741519
<SOS> andrea seized the certificate of his father 's marriage and his own baptismal register , and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances , he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents , and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents . <EOS>	72.4020739041753
<SOS> when he had perused the documents , an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance , and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile , he said , in very excellent tuscan : `` then there is no longer any such thing , in italy as being condemned to the galleys ?

<SOS> `` will you be good enough to explain your meaning ? '' <EOS>	104.17325347159165

<SOS> `` my dear m. cavalcanti , '' said andrea , taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner , `` how much are you paid for being my father ? '' <EOS>	81.45501055563948
<SOS> the major was about to speak , when andrea continued , in a low voice : `` nonsense , i am going to set you an example of confidence , they give me < num > , < num > francs a year to be your son ; consequently , you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent .

<SOS> the major looked anxiously around him . <EOS>	87.50518880045803
<SOS> `` make yourself easy , we are quite alone , '' said andrea ; `` besides , we are conversing in italian . '' <EOS>	78.0804818146182

<SOS> `` you have , then , been induced to alter your opinion ; you have had some proofs of their truth ? '' <EOS>	71.18377564023778
<SOS> the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold . <EOS>	94.92728784851433
<SOS> `` most palpable proofs , '' said he , `` as you may perceive . '' <EOS>	83.04927938842134

<SOS> on hearing the sound of his footsteps , the two men threw themselves in each other 's arms , and while they were in the midst of this embrace , the count entered . <EOS>	76.00562376292625
<SOS> `` well , marquis , '' said monte cristo , `` you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you . '' <EOS>	78.25376779597883

<SOS> `` at what hour shall we come ? '' <EOS>	93.63545384412349

<SOS> `` about half past six . '' <EOS>	86.24089817766034
<SOS> `` we will be with you at that time , '' said the major . <EOS>	70.94667217950972
<SOS> the two cavalcanti bowed to the count , and left the house . <EOS>	66.29907077005942
<SOS> monte cristo went to the window , and saw them crossing the street , arm in arm . <EOS>	75.94273264938202
<SOS> `` there go two miscreants ; '' said he , `` it is a pity they are not really related ! '' <EOS>	76.66441937464405
<SOS> then , after an instant of gloomy reflection , `` come , i will go to see the morrels , '' said he ; `` i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred . '' <EOS>	111.2709696300009

<SOS> in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m. de villefort 's house , and , behind the gate , half screened from view by the large chestnut trees , which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches , we shall find some people of our acquaintance . <EOS>	78.47756136335758
<SOS> this time maximilian was the first to arrive . <EOS>	78.86162104867553
<SOS> he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees , and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk . <EOS>	115.65825385727001
<SOS> at length , the long desired sound was heard , and instead of one figure , as he had expected , he perceived that two were approaching him . <EOS>	65.99334452228368
<SOS> the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie , which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected . <EOS>	76.1838783084029
<SOS> that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian , she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden , being anxious to show that the delay , which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him , was not occasioned by any neglect on her part . <EOS>	100.12518779904461
<SOS> the young man , with the intuitive perception of a lover , quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed , and he was comforted . <EOS>	118.47298573116085
<SOS> besides , although she avoided coming within speaking distance , valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass , and each time she went by , she managed , unperceived by her companion , to cast an expressive look at the young man , which seemed to say , `` have patience ! <EOS>	71.09661390391487
<SOS> you see it is not my fault . '' <EOS>	94.54150517887639
<SOS> and maximilian was patient , and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls , one fair , with soft languishing eyes , a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow ; the other a brunette , with a fierce and haughty expression , and as straight as a poplar . <EOS>	61.22128825075431
<SOS> it is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man , valentine did not suffer by the contrast . <EOS>	94.84821145361569
<SOS> in about half an hour the girls went away , and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars ' visit had at last come to an end . <EOS>	86.10199176277648
<SOS> in a few minutes valentine re entered the garden alone . <EOS>	56.869415361468356
<SOS> for fear that anyone should be observing her return , she walked slowly ; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate , she seated herself on a bench , and , carefully casting her eyes around , to convince herself that she was not watched , she presently arose , and proceeded quickly to join maximilian . <EOS>	55.635573214937914
<SOS> `` good evening , valentine , '' said a well known voice . <EOS>	80.89320265719138
<SOS> `` good evening , maximilian ; i know i have kept you waiting , but you saw the cause of my delay . '' <EOS>	103.69873917338096
<SOS> `` yes , i recognized mademoiselle danglars . <EOS>	96.2787900369699
<SOS> i was not aware that you were so intimate with her . '' <EOS>	75.3857778399877
<SOS> `` who told you we were intimate , maximilian ? '' <EOS>	79.46810387486764
<SOS> `` no one , but you appeared to be so . <EOS>	60.16786695491203
<SOS> from the manner in which you walked and talked together , one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other . '' <EOS>	71.73791220178164
<SOS> `` we were having a confidential conversation , '' returned valentine ; `` she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m. de morcerf ; and i , on the other hand , was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m . <EOS>	78.38167864707098
<SOS> d'épinay . '' <EOS>	88.14904768066711
<SOS> `` dear valentine ! '' <EOS>	90.08682515247249
<SOS> `` that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie , as in speaking of the man whom i could not love , my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed . '' <EOS>	77.28401824169222
<SOS> `` ah , how good you are to say so , valentine ! <EOS>	99.6213998848116
<SOS> you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars . <EOS>	93.44245879708133
<SOS> it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit , for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek . '' <EOS>	88.97811466355687
<SOS> `` it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light . '' <EOS>	66.05567677519606
<SOS> `` no , valentine , i assure you such is not the case . <EOS>	84.4596707213766
<SOS> i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden , and , on my honor , without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars , i can not understand how any man can really love her . '' <EOS>	86.79467516059952
<SOS> `` the fact is , maximilian , that i was there , and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison . '' <EOS>	89.32468115016617
<SOS> `` no ; but tell me it is a question of simple curiosity , and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars `` `` i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say . <EOS>	80.75047209639638
<SOS> it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex , '' interrupted valentine . <EOS>	115.34929253389528
<SOS> `` you can not , at least , deny that you are very harsh judges of each other . '' <EOS>	63.11471491569358
<SOS> `` if we are so , it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement . <EOS>	89.30883942687532
<SOS> but return to your question . '' <EOS>	70.86957592507838
<SOS> < num > m `` does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m. de morcerf on account of loving another ? '' <EOS>	82.2221015903961
<SOS> `` i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie . '' <EOS>	71.76582645755744
<SOS> `` yes , but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate ; own , now , that you did question her on the subject . <EOS>	92.18369281473937
<SOS> ah , i see you are smiling . '' <EOS>	65.78843544767963
<SOS> `` if you are already aware of the conversation that passed , the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security . '' <EOS>	69.60597741237892
<SOS> `` come , what did she say ? '' <EOS>	111.03468003233368
<SOS> `` she told me that she loved no one , '' said valentine ; `` that she disliked the idea of being married ; that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life ; and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune , that she might become an artist , like her friend , mademoiselle louise d'armilly . '' <EOS>	91.14853952509313
<SOS> `` ah , you see `` `` well , what does that prove ? '' <EOS>	91.06960087498878

<SOS> nay , further , have you never endeavored to recall the time , place , and circumstances of your former intercourse , and failing in this attempt , have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present , and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past ?

<SOS> `` your logic is most powerful , valentine , but say what you will , i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind . <EOS>	86.28978672996473
<SOS> i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me , and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come , and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will .

<SOS> has the sun done anything for me ? <EOS>	84.61252709840386
<SOS> no ; he warms me with his rays , and it is by his light that i see you nothing more . <EOS>	85.73529156788572

<SOS> no ; its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it . <EOS>	84.15562588030191
<SOS> my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me . <EOS>	93.23714372973065
<SOS> a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship . <EOS>	77.49611687395361
<SOS> in his most simple actions , as well as in his most secret thoughts , i find a relation to my own . <EOS>	64.09826081639157
<SOS> you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that , ever since i have known this man , i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him . <EOS>	93.22079425681449
<SOS> however , i have managed to live thirty years without this protection , you will say ; but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning . <EOS>	92.04848250996388

<SOS> well , what have i learned since ? <EOS>	104.02470377984851
<SOS> that your mother and m. de villefort are both coming to this dinner . <EOS>	88.95247551894137
<SOS> i shall meet them there , and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview ? <EOS>	79.85790991098902

<SOS> i believe that this singular man , who appears to fathom the motives of everyone , has purposely arranged for me to meet m. and madame de villefort , and sometimes , i confess , i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love . '' <EOS>	75.61100858598522
<SOS> `` my good friend , '' said valentine , `` i should take you for a visionary , and should tremble for your reason , if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this . <EOS>	92.89712723073131

<SOS> my father , who never goes out , has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation ; madame de villefort , on the contrary , is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house , therefore , she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her . <EOS>	82.96022132279224
<SOS> no , no ; it is as i have said , maximilian , there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather , who is little better than a corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven ! '' <EOS>	85.66351981024307
<SOS> `` i see that you are right , logically speaking , '' said maximilian ; `` but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today . '' <EOS>	101.86154288370902
<SOS> `` i feel the same as regards yourself . '' <EOS>	84.2218538324483

<SOS> `` it is , nevertheless , conclusive to my mind . <EOS>	101.70137769565845
<SOS> my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations , for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left , in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side , while it left me unharmed . '' <EOS>	106.87744277649487
<SOS> `` dear maximilian , why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety ? <EOS>	65.2089954131751

<SOS> < num > m `` yes , since you have known me , '' said morrel , smiling ; `` but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance , valentine . '' <EOS>	62.876467619632436
<SOS> `` you are very provoking , and will not give me credit for anything ; but let me hear this second proof , which you yourself own to be absurd . '' <EOS>	80.67250267073663
<SOS> `` well , look through this opening , and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here . '' <EOS>	78.88268032936169
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	99.77044587442762
<SOS> what a beautiful creature ! '' <EOS>	90.75145291462808
<SOS> cried valentine ; `` why did you not bring him close to the gate , so that i could talk to him and pat him ? '' <EOS>	105.34042638277397
<SOS> `` he is , as you see , a very valuable animal , '' said maximilian . <EOS>	81.73341721405838
<SOS> `` you know that my means are limited , and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions . <EOS>	92.49011725935078
<SOS> well , i went to a horse dealer 's , where i saw this magnificent horse , which i have named médéah . <EOS>	94.1904137481833
<SOS> i asked the price ; they told me it was < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	83.69361319930707
<SOS> i was , therefore , obliged to give it up , as you may imagine , but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart , for the horse had looked at me affectionately , had rubbed his head against me and , when i mounted him , had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable , so that i was altogether fascinated with him . <EOS>	100.00696305244821
<SOS> the same evening some friends of mine visited me , m. de château renaud , m. debray , and five or six other choice spirits , whom you do not know , even by name . <EOS>	99.47959808668111
<SOS> they proposed a game of bouillotte . <EOS>	98.01748800304851
<SOS> i never play , for i am not rich enough to afford to lose , or sufficiently poor to desire to gain . <EOS>	73.83808782990496
<SOS> but i was at my own house , you understand , so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards , which i did . <EOS>	97.60779514166026
<SOS> `` just as they were sitting down to table , m. de monte cristo arrived . <EOS>	74.5862406637771
<SOS> he took his seat amongst them ; they played , and i won . <EOS>	101.31921891085832
<SOS> i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	79.00862843944148
<SOS> we separated at midnight . <EOS>	104.20918427517063
<SOS> i could not defer my pleasure , so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer 's . <EOS>	99.56057901171832
<SOS> feverish and excited , i rang at the door . <EOS>	101.88899953155548
<SOS> the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman , for i rushed at once to the stable . <EOS>	79.44461179441434
<SOS> médéah was standing at the rack , eating his hay . <EOS>	55.981638276356676
<SOS> i immediately put on the saddle and bridle , to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible ; then , putting the < num > , < num > francs into the hands of the astonished dealer , i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées . <EOS>	97.46500252664997
<SOS> as i rode by the count 's house i perceived a light in one of the windows , and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain . <EOS>	74.11114809703345
<SOS> now , valentine , i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse , and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him . '' <EOS>	63.83025663435943
<SOS> `` my dear maximilian , you are really too fanciful ; you will not love even me long . <EOS>	88.03289250406762
<SOS> a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common , every day sort of attachment such as ours . <EOS>	105.07947081624683
<SOS> but they are calling me . <EOS>	86.71279169051991
<SOS> do you hear ? '' <EOS>	89.91791739351636
<SOS> `` ah , valentine , '' said maximilian , `` give me but one finger through this opening in the grating , one finger , the littlest finger of all , that i may have the happiness of kissing it . '' <EOS>	74.63728144692061
<SOS> `` maximilian , we said we would be to each other as two voices , two shadows . '' <EOS>	105.8308434488304
<SOS> `` as you will , valentine . '' <EOS>	91.3473783623866
<SOS> `` shall you be happy if i do what you wish ? '' <EOS>	76.39272627838417
<SOS> `` oh , yes ! '' <EOS>	68.21396794557938
<SOS> valentine mounted on a bench , and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening . <EOS>	82.50561046430073
<SOS> maximilian uttered a cry of delight , and , springing forwards , seized the hand extended towards him , and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss . <EOS>	67.18760631232782
<SOS> the little hand was then immediately withdrawn , and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house , as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations . <EOS>	59.7751731931839
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	66.45282953627289
<SOS> m. noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king 's attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter , and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine , which we have just detailed . <EOS>	121.92889622553724
<SOS> m. de villefort entered his father 's room , followed by madame de villefort . <EOS>	57.31261352471671
<SOS> both of the visitors , after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois , a faithful servant , who had been twenty five years in his service , took their places on either side of the paralytic . <EOS>	72.5684797825979
<SOS> m. noirtier was sitting in an armchair , which moved upon casters , in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning , and in the same way drawn out again at night . <EOS>	82.08118266989976
<SOS> he was placed before a large glass , which reflected the whole apartment , and so , without any attempt to move , which would have been impossible , he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him . <EOS>	117.11858602593449
<SOS> m. noirtier , although almost as immovable as a corpse , looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression , perceiving at once , by their ceremonious courtesy , that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character . <EOS>	86.65971367817122
<SOS> sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity . <EOS>	99.86756741047854
<SOS> noirtier 's hair was long and white , and flowed over his shoulders ; while in his eyes , shaded by thick black lashes , was concentrated , as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others , all the activity , address , force , and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body ; and so although the movement of the arm , the sound of the voice , and the agility of the body , were wanting , the speaking eye sufficed for all . <EOS>	84.55902777542526
<SOS> he commanded with it ; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed . <EOS>	96.12976308646122
<SOS> in short , his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes , and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs , while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation . <EOS>	109.8545727931899
<SOS> three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic ; these were villefort , valentine , and the old servant of whom we have already spoken . <EOS>	80.11954352571082
<SOS> but as villefort saw his father but seldom , and then only when absolutely obliged , and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there , all the old man 's happiness was centred in his granddaughter . <EOS>	85.630197071842
<SOS> valentine , by means of her love , her patience , and her devotion , had learned to read in noirtier 's look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind . <EOS>	85.71714734851783
<SOS> to this dumb language , which was so unintelligible to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration , united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses . <EOS>	75.85346343426895
<SOS> valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body . <EOS>	59.114523291337456
<SOS> as to the servant , he had , as we have said , been with his master for five and twenty years , therefore he knew all his habits , and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything , so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid . <EOS>	83.83875502045534
<SOS> villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin . <EOS>	65.54581192418671
<SOS> as we have said , he perfectly understood the old man 's vocabulary , and if he did not use it more often , it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing . <EOS>	80.38223632607374
<SOS> he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden , sent away barrois , and after having seated himself at his father 's right hand , while madame de villefort placed herself on the left , he addressed him thus : `` i trust you will not be displeased , sir , that valentine has not come with us , or that i dismissed barrois , for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either . <EOS>	71.75321518023819
<SOS> madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you . '' <EOS>	71.09917560198275
<SOS> noirtier 's face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble , while , on the contrary , villefort 's eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man 's heart . <EOS>	82.4267085350265
<SOS> `` this communication , '' continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , `` will , we are sure , meet with your approbation . '' <EOS>	100.81994973922332
<SOS> the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more . <EOS>	89.28354620072999
<SOS> `` sir , '' resumed villefort , `` we are thinking of marrying valentine . '' <EOS>	62.636531078494606
<SOS> had the old man 's face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there . <EOS>	89.7078920846088
<SOS> `` the marriage will take place in less than three months , '' said villefort . <EOS>	98.6030193282192
<SOS> noirtier 's eye still retained its inanimate expression . <EOS>	76.9768600851464
<SOS> madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added : `` we thought this news would possess an interest for you , sir , who have always entertained a great affection for valentine ; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined . <EOS>	61.51291429864857
<SOS> it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed ; he possesses fortune , a high rank in society , and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy , his name , moreover , can not be wholly unknown to you . <EOS>	97.69612180492636
<SOS> it is m. franz de quesnel , baron d'épinay . '' <EOS>	91.8149783646824
<SOS> while his wife was speaking , villefort had narrowly watched the old man 's countenance . <EOS>	58.6475738765322
<SOS> when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz , the pupil of m. noirtier 's eye began to dilate , and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak , and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son . <EOS>	80.27333709992794
<SOS> the procureur , who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m. noirtier and the elder d'épinay , well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced ; but , feigning not to perceive either , he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife . <EOS>	70.95047262948083
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he , `` you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year , which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance . <EOS>	84.19527518644372
<SOS> nevertheless , you have not been forgotten in our plans , and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentine 's future husband will consent , not to live in this house , for that might not be pleasant for the young people , but that you should live with them ; so that you and valentine , who are so attached to each other , would not be separated , and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done , and thus , instead of losing , you will be a gainer by the change , as it will secure to you two children instead of one , to watch over and comfort you . '' <EOS>	100.93852677027067
<SOS> < num > m noirtier 's look was furious ; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man 's mind , for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat , and not being able to find vent in utterance , appeared almost to choke him , for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle . <EOS>	83.86656827859017
<SOS> villefort quietly opened a window , saying , `` it is very warm , and the heat affects m . <EOS>	77.62430505216903
<SOS> noirtier . '' <EOS>	69.10343395054817
<SOS> he then returned to his place , but did not sit down . <EOS>	93.08463656862315
<SOS> `` this marriage , '' added madame de villefort , `` is quite agreeable to the wishes of m. d'épinay and his family ; besides , he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt , his mother having died at his birth , and his father having been assassinated in < num > , that is to say , when he was but two years old ; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits , and he has , therefore , seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will . '' <EOS>	81.3578506393526
<SOS> `` that assassination was a mysterious affair , '' said villefort , `` and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection , although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person . '' <EOS>	80.6021840072572
<SOS> noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile . <EOS>	80.10489799886575
<SOS> `` now , '' continued villefort , `` those to whom the guilt really belongs , by whom the crime was committed , on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here , and the certain judgment of god hereafter , would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed . '' <EOS>	87.4819104287287
<SOS> noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame . <EOS>	72.50784470641791
<SOS> `` yes , i understand , '' was the reply contained in his look ; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation , mixed with profound contempt . <EOS>	73.80771669601697
<SOS> villefort fully understood his father 's meaning , and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders . <EOS>	76.29913651794548
<SOS> he then motioned to his wife to take leave . <EOS>	59.94570942019363
<SOS> `` now sir , '' said madame de villefort , `` i must bid you farewell . <EOS>	72.8137951248527
<SOS> would you like me to send edward to you for a short time ? '' <EOS>	94.76713612483631
<SOS> it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes , his refusal by winking them several times , and if he had some desire or feeling to express , he raised them to heaven . <EOS>	92.15856978473707
<SOS> if he wanted valentine , he closed his right eye only , and if barrois , the left . <EOS>	78.90143523672849
<SOS> at madame de villefort 's proposition he instantly winked his eyes . <EOS>	111.90523083613999
<SOS> provoked by a complete refusal , she bit her lip and said , `` then shall i send valentine to you ? '' <EOS>	102.87545549977855
<SOS> the old man closed his eyes eagerly , thereby intimating that such was his wish . <EOS>	97.96310063173019
<SOS> m. and madame de villefort bowed and left the room , giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather 's presence , and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid . <EOS>	82.38310120224632
<SOS> valentine , with a color still heightened by emotion , entered the room just after her parents had quitted it . <EOS>	86.40301774488978
<SOS> one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering , and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her . <EOS>	79.8933631830894
<SOS> `` dear grandpapa , '' cried she , `` what has happened ? <EOS>	76.40734087948408
<SOS> they have vexed you , and you are angry ? '' <EOS>	110.78045304108204
<SOS> the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent . <EOS>	92.72197326810858
<SOS> `` who has displeased you ? <EOS>	69.67299657925777
<SOS> is it my father ? '' <EOS>	70.59939817856373
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	101.15100740681886
<SOS> `` madame de villefort ? '' <EOS>	56.98396560021297
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	95.16777057639788
<SOS> `` me ? '' <EOS>	95.61028279274946
<SOS> the former sign was repeated . <EOS>	84.44268287200693
<SOS> `` are you displeased with me ? '' <EOS>	102.7085780895571
<SOS> cried valentine in astonishment . <EOS>	70.62290692075189
<SOS> m. noirtier again closed his eyes . <EOS>	70.2468543508402
<SOS> `` and what have i done , dear grandpapa , that you should be angry with me ? '' <EOS>	86.65445305502561
<SOS> cried valentine . <EOS>	70.85557193081179
<SOS> there was no answer , and she continued : `` i have not seen you all day . <EOS>	97.35644670467916
<SOS> has anyone been speaking to you against me ? '' <EOS>	90.69667608292347
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the old man 's look , with eagerness . <EOS>	100.49172567697973
<SOS> `` let me think a moment . <EOS>	101.75340192991003
<SOS> i do assure you , grandpapa ah m. and madame de villefort have just left this room , have they not ? '' <EOS>	86.71119702432881
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	69.88718960597936
<SOS> `` and it was they who told you something which made you angry ? <EOS>	107.32745680271718
<SOS> what was it then ? <EOS>	72.53315609498284
<SOS> may i go and ask them , that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you ? '' <EOS>	103.63555249167825
<SOS> `` no , no , '' said noirtier 's look . <EOS>	64.67654218834076
<SOS> `` ah , you frighten me . <EOS>	59.406874050012455
<SOS> what can they have said ? '' <EOS>	96.6349820684072
<SOS> and she again tried to think what it could be . <EOS>	78.87557280845814
<SOS> `` ah , i know , '' said she , lowering her voice and going close to the old man . <EOS>	89.27984557171511
<SOS> `` they have been speaking of my marriage , have they not ? '' <EOS>	84.53204844485178
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the angry look . <EOS>	89.26028022365936
<SOS> `` i understand ; you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject . <EOS>	112.91520696776116
<SOS> the reason of it was , that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret , and begged me not to tell you anything of it . <EOS>	63.95692668484292
<SOS> they did not even acquaint me with their intentions , and i only discovered them by chance , that is why i have been so reserved with you , dear grandpapa . <EOS>	86.12692718275993
<SOS> pray forgive me . '' <EOS>	73.97858242387998
<SOS> but there was no look calculated to reassure her ; all it seemed to say was , `` it is not only your reserve which afflicts me . '' <EOS>	89.88132253257355
<SOS> `` what is it , then ? '' <EOS>	93.98649226501055
<SOS> asked the young girl . <EOS>	110.10243998418056
<SOS> `` perhaps you think i shall abandon you , dear grandpapa , and that i shall forget you when i am married ? '' <EOS>	101.80507555040401
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	67.34635897057365
<SOS> `` they told you , then , that m. d'épinay consented to our all living together ? '' <EOS>	84.22907030490545
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	92.35991478043432
<SOS> `` then why are you still vexed and grieved ? '' <EOS>	73.97731139531963
<SOS> the old man 's eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection . <EOS>	87.24725932084304
<SOS> `` yes , i understand , '' said valentine ; `` it is because you love me . '' <EOS>	57.958496317638705
<SOS> the old man assented . <EOS>	89.21697544784944
<SOS> `` and you are afraid i shall be unhappy ? '' <EOS>	85.69730145230695
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	66.71661930316878
<SOS> `` you do not like m . <EOS>	71.34678357627062
<SOS> franz ? '' <EOS>	65.32839213899899
<SOS> the eyes repeated several times , `` no , no , no . '' <EOS>	71.22352072874864
<SOS> `` then you are vexed with the engagement ? '' <EOS>	82.76791928293007
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	69.90107806987511
<SOS> `` well , listen , '' said valentine , throwing herself on her knees , and putting her arm round her grandfather 's neck , `` i am vexed , too , for i do not love m. franz d'épinay . '' <EOS>	80.38992202196594
<SOS> an expression of intense joy illumined the old man 's eyes . <EOS>	99.81871401041437
<SOS> `` when i wished to retire into a convent , you remember how angry you were with me ? '' <EOS>	66.12350850111889
<SOS> a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid . <EOS>	86.68882627958331
<SOS> `` well , '' continued valentine , `` the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage , which drives me to despair . '' <EOS>	98.26652227861817
<SOS> noirtier 's breathing came thick and short . <EOS>	87.12433186932044
<SOS> `` then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too ? <EOS>	97.48040481132465
<SOS> ah , if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan ! <EOS>	94.5412585587293
<SOS> but you are unable to oppose them , you , whose mind is so quick , and whose will is so firm are nevertheless , as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself . <EOS>	76.653613262019
<SOS> alas , you , who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength , can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows , without being able to take any active part in them . <EOS>	97.9464894692732
<SOS> however , this is much , and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness . '' <EOS>	79.78883281880205
<SOS> at these words there appeared in noirtier 's eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there : `` you are mistaken ; i can still do much for you . '' <EOS>	117.4972903304416
<SOS> `` do you think you can help me , dear grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	88.27379587876484
<SOS> said valentine . <EOS>	73.62228989933595
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	90.68316208222443
<SOS> noirtier raised his eyes , it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything . <EOS>	87.5607502672641
<SOS> `` what is it you want , dear grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	113.9367217533944
<SOS> said valentine , and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need ; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind , she repeated them aloud , then , finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant `` no , '' she said , `` come , since this plan does not answer , i will have recourse to another . '' <EOS>	68.38964332923543
<SOS> she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n. when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted . <EOS>	104.20861075439394
<SOS> `` ah , '' said valentine , `` the thing you desire begins with the letter n ; it is with n that we have to do , then . <EOS>	101.23321339476766
<SOS> well , let me see , what can you want that begins with n ? <EOS>	84.23058648225629
<SOS> na ne ni no `` `` yes , yes , yes , '' said the old man 's eye . <EOS>	79.19426210746994
<SOS> `` ah , it is no , then ? '' <EOS>	109.54374984267754
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	76.69200214781415
<SOS> valentine fetched a dictionary , which she placed on a desk before noirtier ; she opened it , and , seeing that the old man 's eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages , she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns . <EOS>	68.80394230822118
<SOS> during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state , valentine 's powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man 's meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted . <EOS>	76.92701446662021
<SOS> at the word notary , noirtier made a sign to her to stop . <EOS>	73.80898324278452
<SOS> < num > m `` notary , '' said she , `` do you want a notary , dear grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	77.12509904562738
<SOS> the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired . <EOS>	86.9164194865568
<SOS> `` you would wish a notary to be sent for then ? '' <EOS>	87.84805081015523
<SOS> said valentine . <EOS>	105.66959281209752
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	73.04735634859806
<SOS> `` shall my father be informed of your wish ? '' <EOS>	115.96602926564908
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	103.83975775640994
<SOS> `` do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately ? '' <EOS>	86.5742587729147
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	82.68619585359262
<SOS> `` then they shall go for him directly , dear grandpapa . <EOS>	85.94931545008029
<SOS> is that all you want ? '' <EOS>	62.9726717681335
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	53.84360369961209
<SOS> valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m. noirtier 's room . <EOS>	72.04567806054085
<SOS> `` are you satisfied now ? '' <EOS>	116.3140469249606
<SOS> inquired valentine . <EOS>	83.80656644976298
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	75.18101806970913
<SOS> `` i am sure you are ; it is not very difficult to discover that . '' <EOS>	86.96689793851466
<SOS> and the young girl smiled on her grandfather , as if he had been a child . <EOS>	105.9548867721511
<SOS> m. de villefort entered , followed by barrois . <EOS>	61.631340519256234
<SOS> `` what do you want me for , sir ? '' <EOS>	84.62128056570002
<SOS> demanded he of the paralytic . <EOS>	102.24654233335696
<SOS> `` sir , '' said valentine , `` my grandfather wishes for a notary . '' <EOS>	67.30661096618446
<SOS> at this strange and unexpected demand m. de villefort and his father exchanged looks . <EOS>	93.13492353178066
<SOS> `` yes , '' motioned the latter , with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant , who both knew what his wishes were , he was quite prepared to maintain the contest . <EOS>	71.54187833580504
<SOS> `` do you wish for a notary ? '' <EOS>	90.80468928302723
<SOS> asked villefort . <EOS>	90.44594000769523
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	84.44423798866256
<SOS> `` what to do ? '' <EOS>	70.52777301116262
<SOS> noirtier made no answer . <EOS>	102.53018027941344
<SOS> `` what do you want with a notary ? '' <EOS>	94.81432954147778
<SOS> again repeated villefort . <EOS>	78.33237455317872
<SOS> the invalid 's eye remained fixed , by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable . <EOS>	100.9248791486922
<SOS> `` is it to do us some ill turn ? <EOS>	80.4924046545812
<SOS> do you think it is worth while ? '' <EOS>	88.51059838062324
<SOS> said villefort . <EOS>	68.38094251085228
<SOS> `` still , '' said barrois , with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant , `` if m. noirtier asks for a notary , i suppose he really wishes for a notary ; therefore i shall go at once and fetch one . '' <EOS>	90.3994647605045
<SOS> barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier , and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted . <EOS>	69.66134866921277
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , i do want a notary , '' motioned the old man , shutting his eyes with a look of defiance , which seemed to say , `` and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request . '' <EOS>	88.0351476604675
<SOS> `` you shall have a notary , as you absolutely wish for one , sir , '' said villefort ; `` but i shall explain to him your state of health , and make excuses for you , for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one . '' <EOS>	97.87641162047464
<SOS> `` never mind that , '' said barrois ; `` i shall go and fetch a notary , nevertheless . '' <EOS>	76.69047713796014
<SOS> and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission . <EOS>	96.99767723614569
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	86.17341561219241
<SOS> the will as soon as barrois had left the room , noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things . <EOS>	120.12375200437765
<SOS> the young girl perfectly understood the look , and so did villefort , for his countenance became clouded , and he knitted his eyebrows angrily . <EOS>	114.11735398618164
<SOS> he took a seat , and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary . <EOS>	58.73526311600636
<SOS> noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference , at the same time giving a side look at valentine , which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room . <EOS>	75.82826086143302
<SOS> three quarters of an hour after , barrois returned , bringing the notary with him . <EOS>	58.977404396167614
<SOS> `` sir , '' said villefort , after the first salutations were over , `` you were sent for by m. noirtier , whom you see here . <EOS>	89.10427182424431
<SOS> all his limbs have become completely paralysed , he has lost his voice also , and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning . '' <EOS>	100.82760336316692
<SOS> noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine , which look was at once so earnest and imperative , that she answered immediately . <EOS>	90.08737654394574
<SOS> `` sir , '' said she , `` i perfectly understand my grandfather 's meaning at all times . '' <EOS>	89.89499128686862
<SOS> `` that is quite true , '' said barrois ; `` and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along . '' <EOS>	80.48497321327098
<SOS> `` permit me , '' said the notary , turning first to villefort and then to valentine `` permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility . <EOS>	71.93346951709249
<SOS> the first thing necessary to render an act valid is , that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act . <EOS>	67.89310574375861
<SOS> now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak , and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me , on account of his want of speech , my services here would be quite useless , and can not be legally exercised . '' <EOS>	72.66553535960026
<SOS> the notary then prepared to retire . <EOS>	92.70629239043816
<SOS> an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur . <EOS>	76.28148001334611
<SOS> noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief , that she arrested the departure of the notary . <EOS>	104.80983711955895
<SOS> `` sir , '' said she , `` the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt , and i can teach you in a few minutes , to understand it almost as well as i can myself . <EOS>	83.50309099998655
<SOS> will you tell me what you require , in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject ? '' <EOS>	88.41949755922369
<SOS> `` in order to render an act valid , i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client . <EOS>	75.36951083295845
<SOS> illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed , but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite . '' <EOS>	95.51127242641729
<SOS> `` well , sir , by the help of two signs , with which i will acquaint you presently , you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties . <EOS>	71.69869193949417
<SOS> m. noirtier , being deprived of voice and motion , is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify 'yes , ' and to wink when he means 'no . ' <EOS>	59.46669051639122
<SOS> you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m. noirtier ; try . '' <EOS>	119.5119677440107
<SOS> noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself . <EOS>	78.17516020994064
<SOS> `` you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying , sir , have you ? '' <EOS>	81.09725995560545
<SOS> asked the notary . <EOS>	74.9465791588382
<SOS> noirtier closed his eyes . <EOS>	85.37741134043551
<SOS> `` and you approve of what she said that is to say , you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts ? '' <EOS>	109.43853333807417
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	74.93072002668613
<SOS> `` it was you who sent for me ? '' <EOS>	78.80580288446392
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	80.625801323505
<SOS> `` to make your will ? '' <EOS>	84.92449867035765
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	75.87535739602232
<SOS> `` and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions ? '' <EOS>	90.65180153217524
<SOS> the old man winked violently . <EOS>	75.57906332214985
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said the young girl , `` do you understand now , and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject ? '' <EOS>	85.9583856577782
<SOS> but before the notary could answer , villefort had drawn him aside . <EOS>	65.50494006457778
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he , `` do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock , such as m. noirtier has received , without any detriment to his mental faculties ? '' <EOS>	119.72007501837004
<SOS> `` it is not exactly that , sir , '' said the notary , `` which makes me uneasy , but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions , so as to be able to get his answers . '' <EOS>	75.77375529674224
<SOS> `` you must see that to be an utter impossibility , '' said villefort . <EOS>	75.79610343892487
<SOS> valentine and the old man heard this conversation , and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look . <EOS>	88.57811081200407
<SOS> `` sir , '' said she , `` that need not make you uneasy , however difficult it may at first sight appear to be . <EOS>	84.43212196275877
<SOS> i can discover and explain to you my grandfather 's thoughts , so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject . <EOS>	81.33389508101702
<SOS> i have now been six years with m. noirtier , and let him tell you if ever once , during that time , he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand . '' <EOS>	108.14936404279713
<SOS> `` no , '' signed the old man . <EOS>	81.51943196928063
<SOS> `` let us try what we can do , then , '' said the notary . <EOS>	106.67215485108902
<SOS> `` you accept this young lady as your interpreter , m . <EOS>	89.06625833791112
<SOS> noirtier ? '' <EOS>	77.50792028613101
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	113.2333071298199
<SOS> `` well , sir , what do you require of me , and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up ? '' <EOS>	58.81464657728104
<SOS> valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w. at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop . <EOS>	88.29407848814401
<SOS> `` it is very evident that it is the letter w which m. noirtier wants , '' said the notary . <EOS>	74.4806456195595
<SOS> `` wait , '' said valentine ; and , turning to her grandfather , she repeated , `` wa we wi `` the old man stopped her at the last syllable . <EOS>	74.44395799980448
<SOS> valentine then took the dictionary , and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages . <EOS>	100.53783224370183
<SOS> she passed her finger slowly down the columns , and when she came to the word `` will , '' m. noirtier 's eye bade her stop . <EOS>	71.55110144416984
<SOS> `` will , '' said the notary ; `` it is very evident that m. noirtier is desirous of making his will . '' <EOS>	76.11751003130593
<SOS> `` yes , yes , yes , '' motioned the invalid . <EOS>	92.32877373735762
<SOS> `` really , sir , you must allow that this is most extraordinary , '' said the astonished notary , turning to m. de villefort . <EOS>	89.47256938379365
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the procureur , `` and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary , for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine , and she may , perhaps , be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather . '' <EOS>	62.11759743061679
<SOS> `` no , no , no , '' replied the eye of the paralytic . <EOS>	93.39980276136826
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	67.61575281836984
<SOS> said villefort , `` do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will ? '' <EOS>	72.84561587705653
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	102.04166190980452
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the notary , whose interest had been greatly excited , and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene , `` what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago , has now become quite easy and practicable , and this may be a perfectly valid will , provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses , approved by the testator , and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses . <EOS>	94.4048450418891
<SOS> as to the time , it will not require very much more than the generality of wills . <EOS>	99.71713840784842
<SOS> there are certain forms necessary to be gone through , and which are always the same . <EOS>	78.08710985688629
<SOS> as to the details , the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator , and by yourself , who , having had the management of them , can doubtless give full information on the subject . <EOS>	78.98402031656401
<SOS> but besides all this , in order that the instrument may not be contested , i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity , therefore , one of my colleagues will help me , and , contrary to custom , will assist in the dictation of the testament . <EOS>	69.4670051600341
<SOS> are you satisfied , sir ? '' <EOS>	100.88122380097084
<SOS> continued the notary , addressing the old man . <EOS>	106.78559708696545
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , '' looked the invalid , his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning . <EOS>	70.81157288028082
<SOS> `` what is he going to do ? '' <EOS>	91.71586170246894
<SOS> thought villefort , whose position demanded much reserve , but who was longing to know what his father 's intentions were . <EOS>	57.40758221089499
<SOS> he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent , but barrois , who had heard all that passed , had guessed his master 's wishes , and had already gone to fetch one . <EOS>	77.24102130377283
<SOS> the procureur then told his wife to come up . <EOS>	94.2934357435798
<SOS> in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic ; the second notary had also arrived . <EOS>	111.4322865851568
<SOS> a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law . <EOS>	62.12724126280021
<SOS> they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will , in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched ; then , in order to test the capacity of the testator , the first notary said , turning towards him : `` when an individual makes his will , it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person . '' <EOS>	82.30649869407613
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	77.52940721818557
<SOS> `` have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune ? '' <EOS>	82.7769729477907
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	98.8636645705269
<SOS> `` i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation ; you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions ? '' <EOS>	77.88192707043014
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	74.70710882807847
<SOS> there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation . <EOS>	91.7768118293617
<SOS> never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now , and if it was not a sublime , it was , at least , a curious spectacle . <EOS>	76.71015879922376
<SOS> they had formed a circle round the invalid ; the second notary was sitting at a table , prepared for writing , and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded . <EOS>	75.82850665463619
<SOS> `` your fortune exceeds < num > , < num > francs , does it not ? '' <EOS>	82.89283847318895
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	81.91174438766042
<SOS> noirtier made a sign that it did . <EOS>	88.27939675540091
<SOS> `` do you possess < num > , < num > francs ? '' <EOS>	68.90517600016834
<SOS> inquired the notary . <EOS>	77.64828314224975
<SOS> noirtier 's eye remained immovable . <EOS>	119.8030734215961
<SOS> `` < num > , < num > ? '' <EOS>	60.33526243172074
<SOS> the same expression continued . <EOS>	84.29021031932687
<SOS> `` < num > , < num > < num > , < num > < num > , < num > < num > , < num > ? '' <EOS>	90.33348365353528
<SOS> noirtier stopped him at the last named sum . <EOS>	86.6982693140851
<SOS> `` you are then in possession of < num > , < num > francs ? '' <EOS>	93.54498753025584
<SOS> asked the notary . <EOS>	55.031393344064305
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	75.89674161169881
<SOS> `` in landed property ? '' <EOS>	117.14632026659748
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	55.78268572106581
<SOS> `` in stock ? '' <EOS>	92.21014947117624
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	118.2330779784708
<SOS> `` the stock is in your own hands ? '' <EOS>	88.53716225739812
<SOS> the look which m. noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find . <EOS>	78.58320928547086
<SOS> the old servant left the room , and presently returned , bringing with him a small casket . <EOS>	71.48902345659127
<SOS> `` do you permit us to open this casket ? '' <EOS>	72.7151966826696
<SOS> asked the notary . <EOS>	81.10632596372342
<SOS> noirtier gave his assent . <EOS>	91.79251816964654
<SOS> they opened it , and found < num > , < num > francs in bank scrip . <EOS>	97.43299798141328
<SOS> the first notary handed over each note , as he examined it , to his colleague . <EOS>	87.91880002697971
<SOS> the total amount was found to be as m. noirtier had stated . <EOS>	82.11368294390081
<SOS> `` it is all as he has said ; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor . '' <EOS>	72.03306295055474
<SOS> then , turning towards the paralytic , he said , `` you possess , then , < num > , < num > francs of capital , which , according to the manner in which you have invested it , ought to bring in an income of about < num > , < num > livres ? '' <EOS>	81.29877880339679
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	89.45199886170828
<SOS> `` to whom do you desire to leave this fortune ? '' <EOS>	66.40871194784911
<SOS> `` oh ! '' <EOS>	85.87254077206894
<SOS> said madame de villefort , `` there is not much doubt on that subject . <EOS>	87.07510680177283
<SOS> m. noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter , mademoiselle de villefort ; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years , and has , by her devoted attention , fully secured the affection , i had almost said the gratitude , of her grandfather , and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion . '' <EOS>	81.47234255379918
<SOS> the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort 's words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain . <EOS>	94.27476642748604
<SOS> `` is it , then , to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these < num > , < num > francs ? '' <EOS>	83.73363939988839
<SOS> demanded the notary , thinking he had only to insert this clause , but waiting first for the assent of noirtier , which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene . <EOS>	106.29280825394603
<SOS> valentine , when her name was made the subject of discussion , had stepped back , to escape unpleasant observation ; her eyes were cast down , and she was crying . <EOS>	93.71000888520045
<SOS> the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness , then , turning towards the notary , he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent . <EOS>	122.86225099804155
<SOS> `` what , '' said the notary , `` do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee ? '' <EOS>	104.26389073850564
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	76.00018179433202
<SOS> `` you are not making any mistake , are you ? '' <EOS>	68.38661230609898
<SOS> said the notary ; `` you really mean to declare that such is not your intention ? '' <EOS>	92.79276508227127
<SOS> `` no , '' repeated noirtier ; `` no . '' <EOS>	99.51471606015939
<SOS> valentine raised her head , struck dumb with astonishment . <EOS>	81.81034763077851
<SOS> it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act . <EOS>	83.91396773541146
<SOS> but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed : `` oh , grandpapa , i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me ; you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed . '' <EOS>	102.59091793080088
<SOS> `` ah , yes , most assuredly , '' said the eyes of the paralytic , for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake . <EOS>	86.5591104663513
<SOS> `` thank you , thank you , '' murmured she . <EOS>	69.95175037084174
<SOS> the old man 's declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort ; she gradually approached the invalid , and said : `` then , doubtless , dear m. noirtier , you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson , edward de villefort ? '' <EOS>	75.50838138035624
<SOS> the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible , and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred . <EOS>	88.35657753474898
<SOS> `` no ? '' <EOS>	98.24143458950233
<SOS> said the notary ; `` then , perhaps , it is to your son , m. de villefort ? '' <EOS>	91.213294680803
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	87.64535484696101
<SOS> the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator . <EOS>	88.59392279787056
<SOS> villefort and his wife both grew red , one from shame , the other from anger . <EOS>	106.49928884586912
<SOS> `` what have we all done , then , dear grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	73.27055044100892
<SOS> said valentine ; `` you no longer seem to love any of us ? '' <EOS>	95.29310461732611
<SOS> the old man 's eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife , and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness . <EOS>	80.84754948536175
<SOS> `` well , '' said she ; `` if you love me , grandpapa , try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment . <EOS>	106.66914454737339
<SOS> you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune ; besides , they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich , even . <EOS>	100.49547466529003
<SOS> explain yourself , then . '' <EOS>	116.75966141870934
<SOS> noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine 's hand . <EOS>	110.98964164638804
<SOS> `` my hand ? '' <EOS>	77.52061065555121
<SOS> said she . <EOS>	111.51219007279599
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	101.51847645923604
<SOS> `` her hand ! '' <EOS>	78.07723884539301
<SOS> exclaimed everyone . <EOS>	90.67706497700291
<SOS> `` oh , gentlemen , you see it is all useless , and that my father 's mind is really impaired , '' said villefort . <EOS>	61.921411457842865
<SOS> `` ah , '' cried valentine suddenly , `` i understand . <EOS>	82.49187465512321
<SOS> it is my marriage you mean , is it not , dear grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	78.37319955169883
<SOS> `` yes , yes , yes , '' signed the paralytic , casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning . <EOS>	70.39216810122059
<SOS> < num > m `` you are angry with us all on account of this marriage , are you not ? '' <EOS>	59.112106309333186
<SOS> `` yes ? '' <EOS>	96.60397417888171
<SOS> `` really , this is too absurd , '' said villefort . <EOS>	59.85222295571472
<SOS> `` excuse me , sir , '' replied the notary ; `` on the contrary , the meaning of m. noirtier is quite evident to me , and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind . '' <EOS>	56.25854423857987
<SOS> `` you do not wish me to marry m. franz d'épinay ? '' <EOS>	92.89030085842276
<SOS> observed valentine . <EOS>	84.99265622672938
<SOS> `` i do not wish it , '' said the eye of her grandfather . <EOS>	82.32490666294969
<SOS> `` and you disinherit your granddaughter , '' continued the notary , `` because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes ? '' <EOS>	98.918956888609
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	86.98932397247577
<SOS> `` so that , but for this marriage , she would have been your heir ? '' <EOS>	57.02090323999558
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	87.4776014033434
<SOS> there was a profound silence . <EOS>	68.48577267644653
<SOS> the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair . <EOS>	90.33388423657708
<SOS> valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude , and villefort was biting his lips with vexation , while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy , which , in spite of herself , appeared in her whole countenance . <EOS>	74.41626706318166
<SOS> `` but , '' said villefort , who was the first to break the silence , `` i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question . <EOS>	103.8078477273351
<SOS> i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter 's hand . <EOS>	91.03277162204563
<SOS> it is my wish that she should marry m. franz d'épinay and she shall marry him . '' <EOS>	86.01247392651163
<SOS> valentine sank weeping into a chair . <EOS>	114.62463209733346
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the notary , `` how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m . <EOS>	52.85747745844563
<SOS> franz ? '' <EOS>	72.17121332861984
<SOS> the old man gave no answer . <EOS>	63.77931246778489
<SOS> `` you will , of course , dispose of it in some way or other ? '' <EOS>	80.00418232209495
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	110.21060555157852
<SOS> `` in favor of some member of your family ? '' <EOS>	82.49755992312014
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	86.19340146739769
<SOS> `` do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes , then ? '' <EOS>	97.91458693140423
<SOS> pursued the notary . <EOS>	84.13515952222275
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	82.38701060673628
<SOS> `` but , '' said the notary , `` you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony ? '' <EOS>	81.66856779317503
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	80.28045541939653
<SOS> `` you only intend , then , to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son ? '' <EOS>	85.31522670316049
<SOS> noirtier made no answer . <EOS>	82.51116391075861
<SOS> `` do you still wish to dispose of all ? '' <EOS>	90.78197544767878
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	73.53555234337144

<SOS> having said this , villefort quitted the room with his wife , leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased . <EOS>	95.54938037761549

<SOS> madame de villefort , who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately , retired to her bedroom , while the procureur , who could better depend upon himself , proceeded at once to the salon . <EOS>	117.53452667303927
<SOS> although m. de villefort flattered himself that , to all outward view , he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind , he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow , so much so that the count , whose smile was radiant , immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air. `` <EOS>	73.55062226942756

<SOS> `` it is an old man 's caprice ! '' <EOS>	85.37199552736689
<SOS> `` and is there no means of making him revoke his decision ? '' <EOS>	95.55559175598113

<SOS> the count , who perceived that m. and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables , appeared to pay no attention to the conversation , and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward , who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird 's water glass . <EOS>	88.16043771927372
<SOS> `` my dear , '' said villefort , in answer to his wife , `` you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family , nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod . <EOS>	69.62575730037729

<SOS> `` that is a serious thing . '' <EOS>	81.13210160678557
<SOS> monte cristo , who pretended not to be listening , heard however , every word that was said . <EOS>	76.96353988946143
<SOS> < num > m `` madame , '' replied villefort `` i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father , because , to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority . <EOS>	108.52310297886058

<SOS> `` yes , sir , that is the reason , '' said villefort , shrugging his shoulders . <EOS>	86.52565869737884

<SOS> `` my father and the baron d'épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending , '' said villefort . <EOS>	80.1311185249158
<SOS> `` was not your father a bonapartist ? '' <EOS>	86.9301616912727
<SOS> asked monte cristo ; `` i think i remember that you told me something of that kind . '' <EOS>	88.00299401845886
<SOS> `` my father has been a jacobin more than anything else , '' said villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; `` and the senator 's robe , which napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him . <EOS>	91.64131408457263
<SOS> when my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the bourbons ; for m. noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain , theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result . '' <EOS>	88.0262239224031
<SOS> `` well , '' said monte cristo , `` it is just as i thought ; it was politics which brought noirtier and m. d'épinay into personal contact . <EOS>	86.32506244634511
<SOS> although general d'épinay served under napoleon , did he not still retain royalist sentiments ? <EOS>	75.73048797144821
<SOS> and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor ? '' <EOS>	85.39668192424938
<SOS> villefort looked at the count almost with terror . <EOS>	106.37536370144804
<SOS> `` am i mistaken , then ? '' <EOS>	114.21903215550756
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	99.55838714974863
<SOS> `` no , sir , the facts were precisely what you have stated , '' said madame de villefort ; `` and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m. de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies . '' <EOS>	109.92531559701983
<SOS> `` it was a sublime and charitable thought , '' said monte cristo , `` and the whole world should applaud it . <EOS>	73.75228952025286
<SOS> it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d'épinay . '' <EOS>	64.52161977498658
<SOS> villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered . <EOS>	100.19379444303875
<SOS> but the count completely baffled the procureur , and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming . <EOS>	99.48536042373854
<SOS> `` although , '' said villefort , `` it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather 's fortune , i do not think that m. d'épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss . <EOS>	84.20774640516778
<SOS> he will , perhaps , hold me in greater esteem than the money itself , seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him . <EOS>	84.72839898651941
<SOS> besides , he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother , and that she will , in all probability , inherit the fortune of m. and madame de saint méran , her mother 's parents , who both love her tenderly . '' <EOS>	98.60860719250435
<SOS> `` and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m. noirtier , '' said madame de villefort ; `` besides , they are to come to paris in about a month , and valentine , after the affront she has received , need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m . <EOS>	77.65330395657284
<SOS> noirtier . '' <EOS>	88.37209023953515
<SOS> the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition . <EOS>	109.32012655906388
<SOS> `` but it seems to me , '' said monte cristo , `` and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say , that if m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested , he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward .

<SOS> `` true , '' said madame de villefort , with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe ; `` is it not unjust shamefully unjust ? <EOS>	82.57690372816614
<SOS> poor edward is as much m. noirtier 's grandchild as valentine , and yet , if she had not been going to marry m. franz , m. noirtier would have left her all his money ; and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather , she will still be three times richer than he . '' <EOS>	110.39966796714182
<SOS> the count listened and said no more . <EOS>	89.39259268784939
<SOS> `` count , '' said villefort , `` we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes . <EOS>	74.85411102515596

<SOS> m. d'épinay , to whom i had promised the interest of this sum , shall receive it , even if i endure the most cruel privations . '' <EOS>	75.36322731138927
<SOS> `` however , '' said madame de villefort , returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind , `` perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m. d'épinay , in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort .

<SOS> `` ah , that would be a great pity , '' said villefort . <EOS>	64.28520300375915
<SOS> `` a great pity , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	104.42543747563671
<SOS> `` undoubtedly , '' said villefort , moderating the tones of his voice , `` a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which i was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground . <EOS>	94.32782037046249
<SOS> no , it will all go well ; m. d'épinay , if he is an honorable man , will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort , unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice , but that is impossible . '' <EOS>	95.90549875514692
<SOS> `` i agree with m. de villefort , '' said monte cristo , fixing his eyes on madame de villefort ; `` and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice , i would persuade him , since i have been told m. d'épinay is coming back , to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation . <EOS>	75.409746712555
<SOS> i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m. de villefort . '' <EOS>	56.18098003317505
<SOS> the procureur arose , delighted with the proposition , but his wife slightly changed color . <EOS>	105.18072514723083
<SOS> `` well , that is all that i wanted , and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are , '' said he , extending his hand to monte cristo . <EOS>	89.24297174505345
<SOS> `` therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened , and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans . '' <EOS>	103.35618331696155
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the count , `` the world , unjust as it is , will be pleased with your resolution ; your friends will be proud of you , and m. d'épinay , even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry , which he will not do , would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty .

<SOS> i shall be expecting you , and if you fail to come , i shall think for how do i know to the contrary ? <EOS>	71.34667725620868
<SOS> that this house , which has remained uninhabited for twenty years , must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it . '' <EOS>	120.49348838595857
<SOS> `` i will come , count , i will be sure to come , '' said villefort eagerly . <EOS>	99.32657247263273
<SOS> `` thank you , '' said monte cristo ; `` now you must permit me to take my leave of you . '' <EOS>	72.09963811718455
<SOS> `` you said before that you were obliged to leave us , monsieur , '' said madame de villefort , `` and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject . '' <EOS>	68.08622681918908
<SOS> `` indeed madame , '' said monte cristo : `` i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going . '' <EOS>	71.9577556977317
<SOS> `` nonsense ; say on . '' <EOS>	89.70325784085126
<SOS> `` well , then , it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together . '' <EOS>	74.25608284719576
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	102.78501868708723
<SOS> `` a telegraph . <EOS>	82.71269436469011
<SOS> so now i have told my secret . '' <EOS>	107.92755944812669
<SOS> `` a telegraph ? '' <EOS>	86.19188605922184
<SOS> repeated madame de villefort . <EOS>	75.53192458095823
<SOS> `` yes , a telegraph . <EOS>	104.25721151548836
<SOS> i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock , and in the light of the sun its black arms , bending in every direction , always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle , and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it , for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity , and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message . <EOS>	66.69412834885541
<SOS> i began to think of genii , sylphs , gnomes , in short , of all the ministers of the occult sciences , until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination . <EOS>	69.77626704825401
<SOS> now , it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects , with their long black claws , for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals , factions , and government intrigues . <EOS>	76.06041079566089
<SOS> but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch , hired for twelve hundred francs a year , and employed all day , not in studying the heavens like an astronomer , or in gazing on the water like an angler , or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him , but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied , black clawed fellow insect , four or five leagues distant from him . <EOS>	78.48263078551693
<SOS> at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely , and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string . '' <EOS>	66.06752507772597

<SOS> `` what telegraph do you intend visiting ? <EOS>	63.48181198695888
<SOS> that of the home department , or of the observatory ? '' <EOS>	108.43450688308518
<SOS> `` oh , no ; i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant , and who would try to explain to me , in spite of myself , a mystery which even they do not understand . <EOS>	70.99138947288142
<SOS> ma foi ! <EOS>	68.96576205158978
<SOS> i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired ; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures . <EOS>	112.08156440890207

<SOS> `` the one that is most in use just at this time . '' <EOS>	79.06252063672375
<SOS> `` the spanish one , you mean , i suppose ? '' <EOS>	96.44767802613862
<SOS> `` yes ; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you `` `` no , '' said monte cristo ; `` since , as i told you before , i do not wish to comprehend it . <EOS>	92.99096803756899
<SOS> the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me ; it will be nothing more than a sign from m. duchâtel , or from m. montalivet , transmitted to the prefect of bayonne , mystified by two greek words , têle , graphein . <EOS>	68.8307254063384
<SOS> it is the insect with black claws , and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance . '' <EOS>	91.36856137346955

<SOS> bayonne ? '' <EOS>	86.3761085940441
<SOS> `` yes ; the road to bayonne . '' <EOS>	89.01999132448803

<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	86.53478101153816

<SOS> on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph . '' <EOS>	112.94801128923234
<SOS> at the door the count was met by the two notaries , who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine , and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit . <EOS>	85.0707922797327
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	92.44949341611952
<SOS> how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated , but the next morning , the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d'enfer , taking the road to orléans . <EOS>	88.32048554827063
<SOS> leaving the village of linas , without stopping at the telegraph , which flourished its great bony arms as he passed , the count reached the tower of montlhéry , situated , as everyone knows , upon the highest point of the plain of that name . <EOS>	76.73412336963194
<SOS> at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path , about eighteen inches wide ; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge , upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers . <EOS>	94.56627479151854
<SOS> monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure , and was not long in finding a little wooden gate , working on willow hinges , and fastened with a nail and string . <EOS>	97.23237907487214
<SOS> the count soon mastered the mechanism , the gate opened , and he then found himself in a little garden , about twenty feet long by twelve wide , bounded on one side by part of the hedge , which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate , and on the other by the old tower , covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers . <EOS>	74.2604108915688
<SOS> no one would have thought in looking at this old , weather beaten , floral decked tower ( which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast ) that it would have been capable of telling strange things , if , in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with , it had also a voice . <EOS>	104.6916077890272
<SOS> the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel , edged by a border of thick box , of many years ' growth , and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix , our modern rubens . <EOS>	72.3062878405496
<SOS> this path was formed in the shape of the figure of < num > , thus , in its windings , making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty . <EOS>	71.08134833696437
<SOS> never had flora , the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners , been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure . <EOS>	113.43570979883964
<SOS> in fact , of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre , not one bore the mark of the slug , nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil . <EOS>	79.1783981042118
<SOS> and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden ; the earth , black as soot , the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence ; besides , had natural humidity been wanting , it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means , thanks to a tank of water , sunk in one of the corners of the garden , and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad , who , from antipathy , no doubt , always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin . <EOS>	107.15413000651894
<SOS> there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower beds ; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure . <EOS>	114.04500249576266
<SOS> monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail , and cast a look around . <EOS>	81.05357203454305
<SOS> `` the man at the telegraph , '' said he , `` must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture . '' <EOS>	65.59765257241807
<SOS> suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves ; the something rose , uttering an exclamation of astonishment , and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old , who was plucking strawberries , which he was placing upon grape leaves . <EOS>	81.31061460859125
<SOS> he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries , which , on rising suddenly , he let fall from his hand . <EOS>	70.35103435903122
<SOS> `` you are gathering your crop , sir ? '' <EOS>	102.86434935194714
<SOS> said monte cristo , smiling . <EOS>	89.3835531810113
<SOS> < num > m `` excuse me , sir , '' replied the man , raising his hand to his cap ; `` i am not up there , i know , but i have only just come down . '' <EOS>	88.88436075228603
<SOS> `` do not let me interfere with you in anything , my friend , '' said the count ; `` gather your strawberries , if , indeed , there are any left . '' <EOS>	70.07420405295967
<SOS> `` i have ten left , '' said the man , `` for here are eleven , and i had twenty one , five more than last year . <EOS>	90.575744320797
<SOS> but i am not surprised ; the spring has been warm this year , and strawberries require heat , sir . <EOS>	92.04232016651073
<SOS> this is the reason that , instead of the sixteen i had last year , i have this year , you see , eleven , already plucked twelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . <EOS>	96.79279159547842
<SOS> ah , i miss three , they were here last night , sir i am sure they were here i counted them . <EOS>	79.51581998943061
<SOS> it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them ; i saw him strolling about here this morning . <EOS>	100.26920329725068
<SOS> ah , the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to . '' <EOS>	61.03715116709218
<SOS> `` certainly , it is wrong , '' said monte cristo , `` but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent . '' <EOS>	66.24577951600178
<SOS> `` of course , '' said the gardener , `` but that does not make it the less unpleasant . <EOS>	82.75731598738955
<SOS> but , sir , once more i beg pardon ; perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here . '' <EOS>	62.42096434132968
<SOS> and he glanced timidly at the count 's blue coat . <EOS>	112.30173391445892
<SOS> < num > m `` calm yourself , my friend , '' said the count , with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent , and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling ; `` i am not an inspector , but a traveller , brought here by a curiosity he half repents of , since he causes you to lose your time . '' <EOS>	108.53445374363993
<SOS> `` ah , my time is not valuable , '' replied the man with a melancholy smile . <EOS>	87.55509541599167
<SOS> `` still it belongs to government , and i ought not to waste it ; but , having received the signal that i might rest for an hour '' ( here he glanced at the sun dial , for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry , even a sun dial ) , `` and having ten minutes before me , and my strawberries being ripe , when a day longer by the by , sir , do you think dormice eat them ? '' <EOS>	107.56566370487737
<SOS> `` indeed , i should think not , '' replied monte cristo ; `` dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved , as the romans did . '' <EOS>	69.29701941822246
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	115.79997971842539
<SOS> did the romans eat them ? '' <EOS>	100.54448254938431
<SOS> said the gardener `` ate dormice ? '' <EOS>	91.09607545310928
<SOS> `` i have read so in petronius , '' said the count . <EOS>	60.6551754116639
<SOS> `` really ? <EOS>	70.03781563549634
<SOS> they ca n't be nice , though they do say 'as fat as a dormouse . ' <EOS>	85.487254679384
<SOS> it is not a wonder they are fat , sleeping all day , and only waking to eat all night . <EOS>	96.52604546639536
<SOS> listen . <EOS>	78.84489042937223
<SOS> last year i had four apricots they stole one , i had one nectarine , only one well , sir , they ate half of it on the wall ; a splendid nectarine i never ate a better . '' <EOS>	74.9668915488189
<SOS> `` you ate it ? '' <EOS>	77.14727604817789
<SOS> `` that is to say , the half that was left you understand ; it was exquisite , sir . <EOS>	73.97859142209421
<SOS> ah , those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels ; like mère simon 's son , who has not chosen the worst strawberries . <EOS>	68.90882839618179
<SOS> but this year , '' continued the horticulturist , `` i 'll take care it shall not happen , even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe . '' <EOS>	97.0586482792056
<SOS> monte cristo had seen enough . <EOS>	91.80009179849834
<SOS> every man has a devouring passion in his heart , as every fruit has its worm ; that of the telegraph man was horticulture . <EOS>	111.74041015420556
<SOS> he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes , and won the heart of the gardener . <EOS>	85.76391045048933
<SOS> `` did you come here , sir , to see the telegraph ? '' <EOS>	108.90825528523978
<SOS> he said . <EOS>	102.04837759362535
<SOS> `` yes , if it is n't contrary to the rules . '' <EOS>	61.698903567101056
<SOS> `` oh , no , '' said the gardener ; `` not in the least , since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying . '' <EOS>	87.87459760732573
<SOS> `` i have been told , '' said the count , `` that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat . '' <EOS>	63.4660065001907
<SOS> `` that is true , sir , and that is what i like best , '' said the man , smiling . <EOS>	111.99037651648402
<SOS> `` why do you like that best ? '' <EOS>	101.11821511163306
<SOS> `` because then i have no responsibility . <EOS>	75.70077124889039
<SOS> i am a machine then , and nothing else , and so long as i work , nothing more is required of me . '' <EOS>	70.95595198940627
<SOS> `` is it possible , '' said monte cristo to himself , `` that i can have met with a man that has no ambition ? <EOS>	88.06084859985641
<SOS> that would spoil my plans . '' <EOS>	93.99915497417155
<SOS> `` sir , '' said the gardener , glancing at the sun dial , `` the ten minutes are almost up ; i must return to my post . <EOS>	82.32848955598591
<SOS> will you go up with me ? '' <EOS>	57.14567594518095
<SOS> `` i follow you . '' <EOS>	74.97724216627292
<SOS> monte cristo entered the tower , which was divided into three stories . <EOS>	80.24224583665709
<SOS> the tower contained implements , such as spades , rakes , watering pots , hung against the wall ; this was all the furniture . <EOS>	78.72284136739331
<SOS> the second was the man 's conventional abode , or rather sleeping place ; it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed , a table , two chairs , a stone pitcher and some dry herbs , hung up to the ceiling , which the count recognized as sweet peas , and of which the good man was preserving the seeds ; he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes . <EOS>	103.735570562578
<SOS> `` does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing ? '' <EOS>	114.49657896103122
<SOS> asked monte cristo . <EOS>	95.38101508064236
<SOS> `` the study does not take long ; it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious . '' <EOS>	97.72872770305479
<SOS> `` and what is the pay ? '' <EOS>	68.72052752241213
<SOS> `` a thousand francs , sir . '' <EOS>	85.41512272875526
<SOS> `` it is nothing . '' <EOS>	86.04331281432937
<SOS> `` no ; but then we are lodged , as you perceive . '' <EOS>	98.3140848038466
<SOS> monte cristo looked at the room . <EOS>	95.88546852046707
<SOS> they passed to the third story ; it was the telegraph room . <EOS>	72.61689268998508
<SOS> monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked . <EOS>	100.5426945003378
<SOS> `` it is very interesting , '' he said , `` but it must be very tedious for a lifetime . '' <EOS>	56.08618738192906
<SOS> `` yes . <EOS>	103.47168517397209
<SOS> at first my neck was cramped with looking at it , but at the end of a year i became used to it ; and then we have our hours of recreation , and our holidays . '' <EOS>	99.7915218159567
<SOS> `` holidays ? '' <EOS>	108.5448177449983
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	72.22357945234874
<SOS> `` when ? '' <EOS>	80.64179987462842
<SOS> `` when we have a fog . '' <EOS>	64.75250426632884
<SOS> `` ah , to be sure . '' <EOS>	76.14728166164458
<SOS> `` those are indeed holidays to me ; i go into the garden , i plant , i prune , i trim , i kill the insects all day long . '' <EOS>	98.7290849417658
<SOS> `` how long have you been here ? '' <EOS>	101.61461874396218
<SOS> `` ten years , and five as a supernumerary make fifteen . '' <EOS>	82.686859613755

<SOS> `` oh , sir , twenty five years . '' <EOS>	83.5304432196839
<SOS> `` and how much is the pension ? '' <EOS>	99.01067598019749

<SOS> `` what did you say , sir ? '' <EOS>	62.95823165430069

<SOS> `` and you reply ? '' <EOS>	89.75669497521594
<SOS> `` by the same sign , which , at the same time , tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready , while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn . '' <EOS>	81.14591513157545

<SOS> `` but what is it ? '' <EOS>	69.7059752312005
<SOS> `` to repeat these signs . '' <EOS>	71.60179671211357
<SOS> monte cristo took a paper from his pocket , upon which were drawn three signs , with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked . <EOS>	89.33577806421592
<SOS> `` there , you see it will not take long . '' <EOS>	83.47618316159668
<SOS> `` yes ; but `` `` do this , and you will have nectarines and all the rest . '' <EOS>	82.7606258082413
<SOS> the shot told ; red with fever , while the large drops fell from his brow , the man executed , one after the other , the three signs given by the count , in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent , who , not understanding the change , began to think the gardener had gone mad . <EOS>	109.19429427836602
<SOS> as to the left hand one , he conscientiously repeated the same signals , which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior . <EOS>	83.89397387762115
<SOS> `` now you are rich , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	60.317516461397624
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the man , `` but at what a price ! '' <EOS>	80.81144974470918
<SOS> `` listen , friend , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	81.80465238907892
<SOS> `` i do not wish to cause you any remorse ; believe me , then , when i swear to you that you have wronged no man , but on the contrary have benefited mankind . '' <EOS>	89.28770815726472
<SOS> the man looked at the bank notes , felt them , counted them , turned pale , then red , then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water , but he had no time to reach the water jug , and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs . <EOS>	84.75287285429569
<SOS> five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister , debray had the horses put to his carriage , and drove to danglars ' house . <EOS>	77.5171898556049
<SOS> `` has your husband any spanish bonds ? '' <EOS>	111.37475498014945
<SOS> he asked of the baroness . <EOS>	103.6003200088535
<SOS> `` i think so , indeed ! <EOS>	69.92594415545106
<SOS> he has six millions ' worth . '' <EOS>	59.81268733823777
<SOS> `` he must sell them at whatever price . '' <EOS>	59.22700946778207
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	64.40940527874059
<SOS> `` because don carlos has fled from bourges , and has returned to spain . '' <EOS>	78.57357361697822
<SOS> < num > m `` how do you know ? '' <EOS>	81.28671116003432
<SOS> debray shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	88.98951920392784
<SOS> `` the idea of asking how i hear the news , '' he said . <EOS>	84.02104646110249
<SOS> the baroness did not wait for a repetition ; she ran to her husband , who immediately hastened to his agent , and ordered him to sell at any price . <EOS>	102.20712972339679
<SOS> when it was seen that danglars sold , the spanish funds fell directly . <EOS>	95.93852923915337
<SOS> danglars lost five hundred thousand francs ; but he rid himself of all his spanish shares . <EOS>	79.61717683328527
<SOS> the same evening the following was read in le messager : `` [ by telegraph . ] <EOS>	97.41448423915062
<SOS> the king , don carlos , has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges , and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier . <EOS>	78.2594511825514
<SOS> barcelona has risen in his favor . '' <EOS>	116.78501435965227
<SOS> all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars , who had sold his shares , and of the luck of the stock jobber , who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow . <EOS>	95.7743691566869
<SOS> those who had kept their shares , or bought those of danglars , looked upon themselves as ruined , and passed a very bad night . <EOS>	73.32078415407132
<SOS> next morning le moniteur contained the following : `` it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of don carlos and the revolt of barcelona . <EOS>	67.45671243889873
<SOS> the king ( don carlos ) has not left bourges , and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace . <EOS>	113.19480813395639
<SOS> a telegraphic signal , improperly interpreted , owing to the fog , was the cause of this error . '' <EOS>	121.34645264081307
<SOS> the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen . <EOS>	83.99507100958222
<SOS> this , reckoning his loss , and what he had missed gaining , made the difference of a million to danglars . <EOS>	100.11545799673294
<SOS> `` good , '' said monte cristo to morrel , who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim , `` i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs , for which i would have paid a hundred thousand . '' <EOS>	85.14929531160018
<SOS> `` what have you discovered ? '' <EOS>	59.86111410885337
<SOS> asked morrel . <EOS>	79.60762873734411
<SOS> `` i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches . '' <EOS>	83.15691379294658
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	75.23359229681436
<SOS> ghosts at first sight , the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor , nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo ; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master , who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside . <EOS>	87.45310714581329
<SOS> the splendor was within . <EOS>	63.193121569075906
<SOS> indeed , almost before the door opened , the scene changed . <EOS>	91.84311114959786
<SOS> m. bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing , and in the rapidity with which it was executed . <EOS>	86.22135385230786
<SOS> it is told that the duc d'antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv . <EOS>	93.3059949888199
<SOS> ; in three days m. bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars , large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house , and in the foreground , instead of the usual paving stones , half hidden by the grass , there extended a lawn but that morning laid down , and upon which the water was yet glistening . <EOS>	65.68196392196289
<SOS> for the rest , the orders had been issued by the count ; he himself had given a plan to bertuccio , marking the spot where each tree was to be planted , and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones . <EOS>	80.5348757502402
<SOS> thus the house had become unrecognizable , and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it , encircled as it was by a framework of trees . <EOS>	90.52668492901465
<SOS> the overseer would not have objected , while he was about it , to have made some improvements in the garden , but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched . <EOS>	100.95748889603236
<SOS> bertuccio made amends , however , by loading the antechambers , staircases , and mantle pieces with flowers . <EOS>	104.36275235740331
<SOS> what , above all , manifested the shrewdness of the steward , and the profound science of the master , the one in carrying out the ideas of the other , was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy , impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time , had in a single day acquired the aspect of life , was scented with its master 's favorite perfumes , and had the very light regulated according to his wish . <EOS>	112.35722694297644
<SOS> when the count arrived , he had under his touch his books and arms , his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures ; his dogs , whose caresses he loved , welcomed him in the antechamber ; the birds , whose songs delighted him , cheered him with their music ; and the house , awakened from its long sleep , like the sleeping beauty in the wood , lived , sang , and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished , and in which , when we are forced to leave them , we leave a part of our souls . <EOS>	92.00022437700608
<SOS> the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard ; some , belonging to the kitchens , gliding down the stairs , restored but the previous day , as if they had always inhabited the house ; others filling the coach houses , where the equipages , encased and numbered , appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years ; and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms , who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters . <EOS>	111.20271517539858
<SOS> the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall , and contained upwards of two thousand volumes ; one division was entirely devoted to novels , and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding . <EOS>	57.28745981875399
<SOS> on the other side of the house , to match with the library , was the conservatory , ornamented with rare flowers , that bloomed in china jars ; and in the midst of the greenhouse , marvellous alike to sight and smell , was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth . <EOS>	101.12617219372362
<SOS> one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio . <EOS>	70.33871343008447
<SOS> before this room , to which you could ascend by the grand , and go out by the back staircase , the servants passed with curiosity , and bertuccio with terror . <EOS>	120.03415592538036
<SOS> at five o'clock precisely , the count arrived before the house at auteuil , followed by ali . <EOS>	75.16531384790252
<SOS> bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience , mingled with uneasiness ; he hoped for some compliments , while , at the same time , he feared to have frowns . <EOS>	73.01749065183608
<SOS> monte cristo descended into the courtyard , walked all over the house , without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure , until he entered his bedroom , situated on the opposite side to the closed room ; then he approached a little piece of furniture , made of rosewood , which he had noticed at a previous visit . <EOS>	114.81534655997704
<SOS> `` that can only be to hold gloves , '' he said . <EOS>	103.87607157778078
<SOS> `` will your excellency deign to open it ? '' <EOS>	80.64810538477128
<SOS> said the delighted bertuccio , `` and you will find gloves in it . '' <EOS>	108.85897198473953
<SOS> elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles , cigars , knick knacks . <EOS>	87.13544076162385
<SOS> < num > m `` good , '' he said ; and m. bertuccio left enraptured , so great , so powerful , and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him . <EOS>	97.61438424775604
<SOS> at precisely six o'clock the clatter of horses ' hoofs was heard at the entrance door ; it was our captain of spahis , who had arrived on médéah . <EOS>	95.90027216348253
<SOS> `` i am sure i am the first , '' cried morrel ; `` i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself , before everyone came . <EOS>	97.09201397631439
<SOS> julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you . <EOS>	90.42381058337395
<SOS> ah , really this is magnificent ! <EOS>	97.0983047417978
<SOS> but tell me , count , will your people take care of my horse ? '' <EOS>	73.33945298367362
<SOS> `` do not alarm yourself , my dear maximilian they understand . '' <EOS>	70.01934999877382
<SOS> `` i mean , because he wants petting . <EOS>	96.05217949259576
<SOS> if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind ! '' <EOS>	96.7372215894056
<SOS> `` i should think so , a horse that cost < num > , < num > francs ! '' <EOS>	104.38075769208432
<SOS> said monte cristo , in the tone which a father would use towards a son . <EOS>	90.0771957141869
<SOS> `` do you regret them ? '' <EOS>	66.7526209523869
<SOS> asked morrel , with his open laugh . <EOS>	91.4921298541385
<SOS> `` i ? <EOS>	102.7009493953071
<SOS> certainly not , '' replied the count . <EOS>	75.59117708921319
<SOS> `` no ; i should only regret if the horse had not proved good . '' <EOS>	89.7956197314661
<SOS> `` it is so good , that i have distanced m. de château renaud , one of the best riders in france , and m. debray , who both mount the minister 's arabians ; and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars , who always go at six leagues an hour . '' <EOS>	77.33474681103812
<SOS> `` then they follow you ? '' <EOS>	109.37088583352386
<SOS> asked monte cristo . <EOS>	101.32257124367312
<SOS> `` see , they are here . '' <EOS>	77.98079997440253
<SOS> and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses , accompanied by two mounted gentlemen , arrived at the gate , which opened before them . <EOS>	62.723729654357314
<SOS> the carriage drove round , and stopped at the steps , followed by the horsemen . <EOS>	102.8486290662857
<SOS> the instant debray had touched the ground , he was at the carriage door . <EOS>	80.86267956240971
<SOS> he offered his hand to the baroness , who , descending , took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo . <EOS>	80.8260620019527
<SOS> but nothing escaped the count 's notice , and he observed a little note , passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice , from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister 's secretary . <EOS>	82.43169200490114
<SOS> after his wife the banker descended , as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage . <EOS>	97.129851292922
<SOS> madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo , around the courtyard , over the peristyle , and across the front of the house , then , repressing a slight emotion , which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color , she ascended the steps , saying to morrel : `` sir , if you were a friend of mine , i should ask you if you would sell your horse . '' <EOS>	84.77769106501773
<SOS> morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace , and then turned round to monte cristo , as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment . <EOS>	104.80715040599338
<SOS> the count understood him . <EOS>	75.84798600398578
<SOS> `` ah , madame , '' he said , `` why did you not make that request of me ? '' <EOS>	116.37761778283249
<SOS> `` with you , sir , '' replied the baroness , `` one can wish for nothing , one is so sure to obtain it . <EOS>	87.10090480293107
<SOS> if it were so with m. morrel `` `` unfortunately , '' replied the count , `` i am witness that m. morrel can not give up his horse , his honor being engaged in keeping it . '' <EOS>	73.30175553517857
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	114.00120354172756
<SOS> `` he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months . <EOS>	94.9864417982378
<SOS> you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named , he would not only lose his bet , but people would say he was afraid ; and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this , even to gratify a pretty woman , which is , in my opinion , one of the most sacred obligations in the world . '' <EOS>	81.88204837215234
<SOS> `` you see my position , madame , '' said morrel , bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo . <EOS>	90.1801292000088
<SOS> `` it seems to me , '' said danglars , in his coarse tone , ill concealed by a forced smile , `` that you have already got horses enough . '' <EOS>	77.7786884203604
<SOS> madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed , but , to the surprise of the young people , she pretended not to hear it , and said nothing . <EOS>	67.52172052366707
<SOS> monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility , and showed her two immense porcelain jars , over which wound marine plants , of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce . <EOS>	72.42544035022667
<SOS> the baroness was astonished . <EOS>	115.67093609084142
<SOS> `` why , '' said she , `` you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside ! <EOS>	104.70932680086425

<SOS> two broke , from the heat of the fire ; the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea . <EOS>	89.9713367275476
<SOS> the sea , knowing what was required of her , threw over them her weeds , encircled them with coral , and encrusted them with shells ; the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths , for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial , and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea . <EOS>	105.69753552102608

<SOS> m. de villefort , notwithstanding his self control , was visibly affected , and when monte cristo touched his hand , he felt it tremble . <EOS>	70.1452779732424
<SOS> `` certainly , women alone know how to dissimulate , '' said monte cristo to himself , glancing at madame danglars , who was smiling on the procureur , and embracing his wife . <EOS>	99.10480253799648
<SOS> after a short time , the count saw bertuccio , who , until then , had been occupied on the other side of the house , glide into an adjoining room . <EOS>	94.06155144750763

<SOS> `` oh , oh ! '' <EOS>	109.21136620765986

<SOS> look at m. andrea cavalcanti , the young man in a black coat , looking at murillo 's 'madonna ' ; now he is turning . '' <EOS>	89.82839936720087
<SOS> this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation , had not a look from monte cristo silenced him . <EOS>	80.72499167654695
<SOS> `` benedetto ? '' <EOS>	98.25662600038483
<SOS> he muttered ; `` fatality ! '' <EOS>	65.71050527228225
<SOS> `` half past six o'clock has just struck , m. bertuccio , '' said the count severely ; `` i ordered dinner at that hour , and i do not like to wait ; '' and he returned to his guests , while bertuccio , leaning against the wall , succeeded in reaching the dining room . <EOS>	56.460023343712315
<SOS> five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open , and bertuccio appearing said , with a violent effort , `` the dinner waits . '' <EOS>	84.00937954217429
<SOS> the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort . <EOS>	83.20018757375622
<SOS> `` m. de villefort , '' he said , `` will you conduct the baroness danglars ? '' <EOS>	70.03670875621135

<SOS> the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room . <EOS>	88.22090177560194
<SOS> each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house , and yet astonished , even uneasy though they were , they still felt that they would not like to be absent . <EOS>	110.94582448627179
<SOS> the recent events , the solitary and eccentric position of the count , his enormous , nay , almost incredible fortune , should have made men cautious , and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them ; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum . <EOS>	107.42927008322235
<SOS> and all present , even including cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man . <EOS>	71.08273446596097
<SOS> madame danglars had started when villefort , on the count 's invitation , offered his arm ; and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles , when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own . <EOS>	92.5780993473019
<SOS> none of this had escaped the count , and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer . <EOS>	73.75564734480614
<SOS> m. de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars , on his left morrel . <EOS>	102.20814262744696
<SOS> the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars ; the other seats were filled by debray , who was placed between the two cavalcanti , and by château renaud , seated between madame de villefort and morrel . <EOS>	81.31964854876642
<SOS> the repast was magnificent ; monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas , and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests . <EOS>	90.35992854085612
<SOS> it was an oriental feast that he offered to them , but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare . <EOS>	96.46944408605545
<SOS> every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from china and jars from japan . <EOS>	59.95021337683076
<SOS> rare birds , retaining their most brilliant plumage , enormous fish , spread upon massive silver dishes , together with every wine produced in the archipelago , asia minor , or the cape , sparkling in bottles , whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught , all these , like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests , passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians , who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons , but only on the condition of eating pearls , like cleopatra , or drinking refined gold , like lorenzo de ' medici . <EOS>	102.01149754229311
<SOS> monte cristo noticed the general astonishment , and began laughing and joking about it . <EOS>	92.95501044115076
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' he said , `` you will admit that , when arrived at a certain degree of fortune , the superfluities of life are all that can be desired ; and the ladies will allow that , after having risen to a certain eminence of position , the ideal alone can be more exalted . <EOS>	76.03459195093173
<SOS> now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? <EOS>	77.6293777846276
<SOS> that which we do not understand . <EOS>	71.74429607238247
<SOS> what is it that we really desire ? <EOS>	58.92643923759439
<SOS> that which we can not obtain . <EOS>	60.35104277605157
<SOS> now , to see things which i can not understand , to procure impossibilities , these are the study of my life . <EOS>	83.810916440359
<SOS> i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money . <EOS>	62.436494915374944
<SOS> i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do , m. danglars , in promoting a new railway line ; you , m. de villefort , in condemning a culprit to death ; you , m. debray , in pacifying a kingdom ; you , m. de château renaud , in pleasing a woman ; and you , morrel , in breaking a horse that no one can ride . <EOS>	71.21535994498267
<SOS> for example , you see these two fish ; one brought from fifty leagues beyond st. petersburg , the other five leagues from naples . <EOS>	102.85282573253563
<SOS> is it not amusing to see them both on the same table ? '' <EOS>	73.751958349759
<SOS> `` what are the two fish ? '' <EOS>	93.19238214042001
<SOS> asked danglars . <EOS>	89.37500323691918
<SOS> `` m. château renaud , who has lived in russia , will tell you the name of one , and major cavalcanti , who is an italian , will tell you the name of the other . '' <EOS>	90.11233467424069
<SOS> `` this one is , i think , a sterlet , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	62.77599138927798
<SOS> `` and that one , if i mistake not , a lamprey . '' <EOS>	80.9626421449712
<SOS> `` just so . <EOS>	79.67585760862309
<SOS> now , m. danglars , ask these gentlemen where they are caught . '' <EOS>	84.38204246366135
<SOS> `` sterlets , '' said château renaud , `` are only found in the volga . '' <EOS>	85.24394862887719
<SOS> `` and , '' said cavalcanti , `` i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size . '' <EOS>	75.03546141741633
<SOS> `` exactly ; one comes from the volga , and the other from lake fusaro . '' <EOS>	63.23423887961185
<SOS> `` impossible ! '' <EOS>	78.92286200744034
<SOS> cried all the guests simultaneously . <EOS>	88.39532535034195
<SOS> `` well , this is just what amuses me , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	89.35248856886416
<SOS> `` i am like nero cupitor impossibilium ; and that is what is amusing you at this moment . <EOS>	92.19000257134138
<SOS> this fish , which seems so exquisite to you , is very likely no better than perch or salmon ; but it seemed impossible to procure it , and here it is . '' <EOS>	93.8975320417355
<SOS> `` but how could you have these fish brought to france ? '' <EOS>	105.17603229434144
<SOS> `` oh , nothing more easy . <EOS>	83.11479319274669
<SOS> each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds , the other with rushes and lake plants ; they were placed in a wagon built on purpose , and thus the sterlet lived twelve days , the lamprey eight , and both were alive when my cook seized them , killing one with milk and the other with wine . <EOS>	84.04739159035394
<SOS> you do not believe me , m . <EOS>	90.33240862487898
<SOS> danglars ! '' <EOS>	86.4879877886601
<SOS> `` i can not help doubting , '' answered danglars with his stupid smile . <EOS>	74.59680536341159
<SOS> `` baptistin , '' said the count , `` have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks , and which are yet alive . '' <EOS>	90.74146099954841
<SOS> danglars opened his bewildered eyes ; the company clapped their hands . <EOS>	69.84672039147908
<SOS> four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants , and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table . <EOS>	106.74301726809844
<SOS> `` but why have two of each sort ? '' <EOS>	110.01589680181614
<SOS> asked danglars . <EOS>	89.44305103493862
<SOS> `` merely because one might have died , '' carelessly answered monte cristo . <EOS>	97.07011293711957
<SOS> `` you are certainly an extraordinary man , '' said danglars ; `` and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich . '' <EOS>	79.33391891049074
<SOS> `` and to have ideas , '' added madame danglars . <EOS>	82.35553998583202
<SOS> `` oh , do not give me credit for this , madame ; it was done by the romans , who much esteemed them , and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome , who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus , and which , from the description , must probably be the goldfish . <EOS>	66.08734878974768
<SOS> it was also considered a luxury to have them alive , it being an amusing sight to see them die , for , when dying , they change color three or four times , and like the rainbow when it disappears , pass through all the prismatic shades , after which they were sent to the kitchen . <EOS>	60.42847629849816
<SOS> their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive , they were despised when dead . '' <EOS>	114.66355408774044

<SOS> madame de villefort rose , monte cristo did the same , and the rest followed their example . <EOS>	73.30873454203945
<SOS> villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment , as if rooted to their seats ; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances . <EOS>	87.79166597222931
<SOS> `` did you hear ? '' <EOS>	105.45588533873016

<SOS> `` we must go , '' replied villefort , offering his arm . <EOS>	78.96113892685828
<SOS> the others , attracted by curiosity , were already scattered in different parts of the house ; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room , and that , at the same time , they would obtain a view of the rest of the building , of which monte cristo had created a palace . <EOS>	80.45551631492182
<SOS> each one went out by the open doors . <EOS>	68.00205405505514
<SOS> monte cristo waited for the two who remained ; then , when they had passed , he brought up the rear , and on his face was a smile , which , if they could have understood it , would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter . <EOS>	90.14186165761028
<SOS> they began by walking through the apartments , many of which were fitted up in the eastern style , with cushions and divans instead of beds , and pipes instead of furniture . <EOS>	101.24516960534703
<SOS> the drawing rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters , the boudoirs hung with draperies from china , of fanciful colors , fantastic design , and wonderful texture . <EOS>	76.20341373066827
<SOS> at length they arrived at the famous room . <EOS>	107.30285502289621
<SOS> there was nothing particular about it , excepting that , although daylight had disappeared , it was not lighted , and everything in it was old fashioned , while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated . <EOS>	65.70663515086007

<SOS> cried madame de villefort , `` it is really frightful . '' <EOS>	101.13821359342045
<SOS> madame danglars tried to utter a few words , but was not heard . <EOS>	67.37834391008128

<SOS> `` i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy , but certainly everything appears to me black in this house , '' said debray . <EOS>	83.85525109409761

<SOS> `` ah , '' she cried , `` what a frightful dream ! '' <EOS>	82.24303581344233

<SOS> they looked for m. danglars , but , as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas , he had gone into the garden , and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence . <EOS>	62.45843558029734
<SOS> monte cristo seemed in despair . <EOS>	91.94772732123577

<SOS> `` yes , count , '' replied villefort , in a voice now scarcely human . <EOS>	70.75510092427834
<SOS> monte cristo , seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it , and not wishing to carry it too far , said : `` come , gentlemen , some coffee , we seem to have forgotten it , '' and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn . <EOS>	94.40328309054748
<SOS> `` indeed , count , '' said madame danglars , `` i am ashamed to own it , but all your frightful stories have so upset me , that i must beg you to let me sit down ; '' and she fell into a chair . <EOS>	85.67514231554307

<SOS> on his wife 's request , m. de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure . <EOS>	64.56759271800605
<SOS> he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars , that she might be under the care of his wife . <EOS>	81.21583450587644

<SOS> while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort , he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars , and he soon guessed all that had passed between them , though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars . <EOS>	82.7476819051489
<SOS> without opposing their arrangements , he allowed morrel , château renaud , and debray to leave on horseback , and the ladies in m. de villefort 's carriage . <EOS>	72.22531062179311
<SOS> danglars , more and more delighted with major cavalcanti , had offered him a seat in his carriage . <EOS>	89.20877851829898
<SOS> andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door ; the groom , in every respect a caricature of the english fashion , was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse . <EOS>	106.80247674574748

<SOS> then he had been seized upon by danglars , who , with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son , and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count , made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir . <EOS>	102.92807044532238
<SOS> he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major 's little finger ; for the major , like a prudent man , in case of any accident happening to his bank notes , had immediately converted them into an available asset . <EOS>	89.32359866098474
<SOS> then , after dinner , on the pretext of business , he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living ; and the father and son , previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his < num > , < num > francs and the other < num > , < num > livres annually , were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker 's servants , so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon . <EOS>	69.70007115123384
<SOS> one thing above all the rest heightened the respect , nay almost the veneration , of danglars for cavalcanti . <EOS>	90.4769801619587
<SOS> the latter , faithful to the principle of horace , nil admirari , had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught . <EOS>	69.24072319761174
<SOS> then he had eaten some without saying a word more ; danglars , therefore , concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti , who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland , and lobsters sent from england , by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro , and the sterlet from the volga . <EOS>	89.91428386852125
<SOS> thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words : `` tomorrow , sir , i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business . '' <EOS>	63.44138308263296
<SOS> `` and i , sir , '' said danglars , `` shall be most happy to receive you . '' <EOS>	75.48197280034253
<SOS> upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes , if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son . <EOS>	62.53270498018791
<SOS> to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him , that he had his own horses and carriages , and that not having come together , it would not be difficult for them to leave separately . <EOS>	89.83245316500135
<SOS> the major seated himself , therefore , by the side of danglars , who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man , and yet who , being able to allow his son < num > , < num > francs a year , might be supposed to possess a fortune of < num > , < num > or < num > , < num > livres . <EOS>	91.31941643879058
<SOS> as for andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to scold his groom , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it . <EOS>	82.30655194801925
<SOS> the groom heard him with humility , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the reins to andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished boot lightly on the step . <EOS>	61.49940353865881
<SOS> at that moment a hand touched his shoulder . <EOS>	88.9988325864174
<SOS> the young man turned round , thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him , and had returned just as they were starting . <EOS>	100.44560653496295
<SOS> but instead of either of these , he saw nothing but a strange face , sunburnt , and encircled by a beard , with eyes brilliant as carbuncles , and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth , pointed and sharp as the wolf 's or jackal 's . <EOS>	99.9814647979082
<SOS> a red handkerchief encircled his gray head ; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs , which seemed as though , like those of a skeleton , they would rattle as he walked ; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man 's shoulder , and which was the first thing andrea saw , seemed of gigantic size . <EOS>	83.8777659267763
<SOS> < num > m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury , or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator ? <EOS>	67.86017000202207
<SOS> we can not say ; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly . <EOS>	73.13839769797484
<SOS> `` what do you want of me ? '' <EOS>	62.72694767841973
<SOS> he asked . <EOS>	61.535779729115035
<SOS> `` pardon me , my friend , if i disturb you , '' said the man with the red handkerchief , `` but i want to speak to you . '' <EOS>	78.36403109686863
<SOS> `` you have no right to beg at night , '' said the groom , endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder . <EOS>	94.60120681411253
<SOS> `` i am not begging , my fine fellow , '' said the unknown to the servant , with so ironical an expression of the eye , and so frightful a smile , that he withdrew ; `` i only wish to say two or three words to your master , who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago . '' <EOS>	80.04767999115042
<SOS> `` come , '' said andrea , with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation , `` what do you want ? <EOS>	60.970772248752105
<SOS> speak quickly , friend . '' <EOS>	70.86640417973085
<SOS> the man said , in a low voice : `` i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris . <EOS>	69.60074631312635
<SOS> i am very tired , and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you , i can scarcely stand . '' <EOS>	75.60682988172721
<SOS> the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity . <EOS>	111.31433022884376
<SOS> `` tell me , '' he said `` tell me what you want ? '' <EOS>	106.4013565082741
<SOS> `` well , then , i want you to take me up in your fine carriage , and carry me back . '' <EOS>	69.86850720151
<SOS> andrea turned pale , but said nothing . <EOS>	79.42467474465872
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the man , thrusting his hands into his pockets , and looking impudently at the youth ; `` i have taken the whim into my head ; do you understand , master benedetto ? '' <EOS>	69.81373703770976
<SOS> at this name , no doubt , the young man reflected a little , for he went towards his groom , saying : `` this man is right ; i did indeed charge him with a commission , the result of which he must tell me ; walk to the barrier , there take a cab , that you may not be too late . '' <EOS>	108.78416525965751
<SOS> the surprised groom retired . <EOS>	77.78576716129781
<SOS> `` let me at least reach a shady spot , '' said andrea . <EOS>	87.55672286993473
<SOS> `` oh , as for that , i 'll take you to a splendid place , '' said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse 's bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him . <EOS>	72.50559209321757
<SOS> `` do n't think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage , '' said he ; `` oh , no , it 's only because i am tired , and also because i have a little business to talk over with you . '' <EOS>	65.61279561099383
<SOS> `` come , step in , '' said the young man . <EOS>	58.992686770861766
<SOS> it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight , for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury . <EOS>	79.81160146555956
<SOS> andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion , who smiled complacently , as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle . <EOS>	75.28446622285794
<SOS> once out of auteuil , andrea looked around , in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and then , stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man , he asked : `` now , tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity ? '' <EOS>	81.12593383807156
<SOS> `` let me ask you why you deceived me ? '' <EOS>	87.18769263915087
<SOS> `` how have i deceived you ? '' <EOS>	90.572108200506
<SOS> `` 'how , ' do you ask ? <EOS>	68.48333666537661
<SOS> when we parted at the pont du var , you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany ; but instead of that , you come to paris . '' <EOS>	75.8311438522644
<SOS> `` how does that annoy you ? '' <EOS>	88.00463249611892
<SOS> `` it does not ; on the contrary , i think it will answer my purpose . '' <EOS>	94.99007560549438
<SOS> `` so , '' said andrea , `` you are speculating upon me ? '' <EOS>	97.40363817287168
<SOS> `` what fine words he uses ! '' <EOS>	73.85127054854293
<SOS> `` i warn you , master caderousse , that you are mistaken . '' <EOS>	74.525313298547
<SOS> `` well , well , do n't be angry , my boy ; you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate ; and misfortunes make us jealous . <EOS>	84.4938488520317
<SOS> i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone , and i pitied you sincerely , as i would a child of my own . <EOS>	88.64640779557763
<SOS> you know i always did call you my child . '' <EOS>	59.839597689257914
<SOS> `` come , come , what then ? '' <EOS>	57.06180481440051
<SOS> `` patience patience ! '' <EOS>	116.14382064801688
<SOS> `` i am patient , but go on . '' <EOS>	62.169081305833316
<SOS> `` all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom , a tilbury , and fine new clothes . <EOS>	96.73832484921107
<SOS> you must have discovered a mine , or else become a stockbroker . '' <EOS>	71.51473329535172
<SOS> `` so that , as you confess , you are jealous ? '' <EOS>	93.0162682779349
<SOS> `` no , i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you ; but as i am not quite properly dressed , i chose my opportunity , that i might not compromise you . '' <EOS>	75.24648380722255
<SOS> `` yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! '' <EOS>	80.10932138481304
<SOS> exclaimed andrea ; `` you speak to me before my servant . '' <EOS>	94.14810804324338
<SOS> `` how can i help that , my boy ? <EOS>	119.07645014268678
<SOS> i speak to you when i can catch you . <EOS>	76.32529048457981
<SOS> you have a quick horse , a light tilbury , you are naturally as slippery as an eel ; if i had missed you tonight , i might not have had another chance . '' <EOS>	67.51939271806104
<SOS> `` you see , i do not conceal myself . '' <EOS>	71.5460334123068
<SOS> `` you are lucky ; i wish i could say as much , for i do conceal myself ; and then i was afraid you would not recognize me , but you did , '' added caderousse with his unpleasant smile . <EOS>	81.86461294767174
<SOS> `` it was very polite of you . '' <EOS>	66.77384686353464
<SOS> `` come , '' said andrea , `` what do you want ? '' <EOS>	76.68612975579377
<SOS> `` you do not speak affectionately to me , benedetto , my old friend , that is not right take care , or i may become troublesome . '' <EOS>	85.80270324536875
<SOS> this menace smothered the young man 's passion . <EOS>	74.41995249555241
<SOS> he urged the horse again into a trot . <EOS>	112.31183573323594
<SOS> `` you should not speak so to an old friend like me , caderousse , as you said just now ; you are a native of marseilles , i am `` `` do you know then now what you are ? '' <EOS>	95.70444515330874
<SOS> `` no , but i was brought up in corsica ; you are old and obstinate , i am young and wilful . <EOS>	102.1841068151012
<SOS> between people like us threats are out of place , everything should be amicably arranged . <EOS>	91.42704748361571
<SOS> is it my fault if fortune , which has frowned on you , has been kind to me ? '' <EOS>	69.31693473499772
<SOS> `` fortune has been kind to you , then ? <EOS>	62.297694744666266
<SOS> your tilbury , your groom , your clothes , are not then hired ? <EOS>	89.46213186411367
<SOS> good , so much the better , '' said caderousse , his eyes sparkling with avarice . <EOS>	78.17366604007852
<SOS> `` oh , you knew that well enough before speaking to me , '' said andrea , becoming more and more excited . <EOS>	90.87699829024335
<SOS> `` if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head , rags on my back , and worn out shoes on my feet , you would not have known me . '' <EOS>	112.34011957135925
<SOS> `` you wrong me , my boy ; now i have found you , nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone , knowing , as i do , the goodness of your heart . <EOS>	76.21230774742291
<SOS> if you have two coats you will give me one of them . <EOS>	91.28316042623158
<SOS> i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry . '' <EOS>	85.45279045214684
<SOS> `` true , '' said andrea . <EOS>	95.18888424172691
<SOS> `` what an appetite you used to have ! <EOS>	75.99440255618144
<SOS> is it as good now ? '' <EOS>	89.27449354575688
<SOS> `` oh , yes , '' replied andrea , laughing . <EOS>	89.92971428003523
<SOS> `` how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left ? '' <EOS>	97.391983773409
<SOS> `` he is not a prince ; simply a count . '' <EOS>	107.99171484807324
<SOS> `` a count , and a rich one too , eh ? '' <EOS>	75.99638268810045
<SOS> `` yes ; but you had better not have anything to say to him , for he is not a very good tempered gentleman . '' <EOS>	95.14761148294383
<SOS> `` oh , be easy ! <EOS>	82.38639753179478
<SOS> i have no design upon your count , and you shall have him all to yourself . <EOS>	103.82354900666756
<SOS> but , '' said caderousse , again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed , `` you must pay for it you understand ? '' <EOS>	87.23893831832152
<SOS> `` well , what do you want ? '' <EOS>	75.68994758557422
<SOS> `` i think that with a hundred francs a month `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	89.13138937884288

<SOS> `` with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy . '' <EOS>	71.08970229261332
<SOS> `` here are two hundred , '' said andrea ; and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse . <EOS>	75.04434099587775
<SOS> < num > m `` good ! '' <EOS>	76.267348235598
<SOS> said caderousse . <EOS>	75.6572290246846
<SOS> `` apply to the steward on the first day of every month , and you will receive the same sum . '' <EOS>	100.34654119178875
<SOS> `` there now , again you degrade me . '' <EOS>	86.21077278882315
<SOS> `` how so ? '' <EOS>	64.5455172278564
<SOS> `` by making me apply to the servants , when i want to transact business with you alone . '' <EOS>	89.05163867663791
<SOS> `` well , be it so , then . <EOS>	79.80877623789027

<SOS> `` why do you wish to know ? '' <EOS>	56.14687455088581
<SOS> asked cavalcanti . <EOS>	75.27422875963137

<SOS> `` ah , true . <EOS>	89.87213124288793
<SOS> well ; i shall rent a room in some respectable house , wear a decent coat , shave every day , and go and read the papers in a café . <EOS>	78.8006024412837
<SOS> then , in the evening , i shall go to the theatre ; i shall look like some retired baker . <EOS>	85.54709187826049
<SOS> that is what i want . '' <EOS>	90.55699535599828

<SOS> `` do you think so , m. bossuet ? <EOS>	74.4770323576043

<SOS> `` no politics , caderousse . <EOS>	97.59622749594064

<SOS> `` not at all , my good friend . '' <EOS>	85.97905351933402
<SOS> `` how ? <EOS>	73.41283861740894

<SOS> `` why , just think for a moment ; with this red handkerchief on my head , with scarcely any shoes , no papers , and ten gold napoleons in my pocket , without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs , why , i should certainly be arrested at the barriers . <EOS>	84.4744581043866
<SOS> then , to justify myself , i should say that you gave me the money ; this would cause inquiries , it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice , and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean . <EOS>	75.17945558724962
<SOS> then i should become simply no . <EOS>	73.81949495325162
<SOS> < num > , and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker ! <EOS>	99.5714964708904
<SOS> no , no , my boy ; i prefer remaining honorably in the capital . '' <EOS>	86.92624439410946
<SOS> andrea scowled . <EOS>	68.8507272248861
<SOS> certainly , as he had himself owned , the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow . <EOS>	83.05464262240453
<SOS> he drew up for a minute , threw a rapid glance around him , and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket , where it began playing with a pistol . <EOS>	75.28987990469744
<SOS> but , meanwhile , caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off his companion , passed his hand behind his back , and opened a long spanish knife , which he always carried with him , to be ready in case of need . <EOS>	101.72181964924505
<SOS> the two friends , as we see , were worthy of and understood one another . <EOS>	86.74514679116544
<SOS> andrea 's hand left his pocket inoffensively , and was carried up to the red moustache , which it played with for some time . <EOS>	76.66620120049794
<SOS> `` good caderousse , '' he said , `` how happy you will be . '' <EOS>	65.13464342053902
<SOS> `` i will do my best , '' said the innkeeper of the pont du gard , shutting up his knife . <EOS>	100.8072928917529
<SOS> `` well , then , we will go into paris . <EOS>	85.82646860131163
<SOS> but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion ? <EOS>	95.09180635505261
<SOS> it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot . '' <EOS>	84.074946074982
<SOS> `` wait , '' said caderousse , `` we shall see . '' <EOS>	96.09737292477128
<SOS> he then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off cavalcanti 's hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself . <EOS>	86.44237961263654

<SOS> they passed the barrier without accident . <EOS>	85.86275397741109

<SOS> a conjugal scene at the place louis xv . <EOS>	90.71313725825735
<SOS> the three young people separated that is to say , morrel went to the boulevards , château renaud to the pont de la révolution , and debray to the quai . <EOS>	86.60757624977505
<SOS> most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their `` domestic hearths , '' as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches , and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces ; but it was not the case with debray . <EOS>	69.9342104811925
<SOS> when he reached the wicket of the louvre , he turned to the left , galloped across the carrousel , passed through the rue saint roch , and , issuing from the rue de la michodière , he arrived at m. danglars ' door just at the same time that villefort 's landau , after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house . <EOS>	89.82352908836621
<SOS> debray , with the air of a man familiar with the house , entered first into the court , threw his bridle into the hands of a footman , and returned to the door to receive madame danglars , to whom he offered his arm , to conduct her to her apartments . <EOS>	63.161262012000684
<SOS> the gate once closed , and debray and the baroness alone in the court , he asked : `` what was the matter with you , hermine ? <EOS>	74.33811609020877
<SOS> and why were you so affected at that story , or rather fable , which the count related ? '' <EOS>	89.43660173603864
<SOS> `` because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening , my friend , '' said the baroness . <EOS>	74.01019347912225
<SOS> `` no , hermine , '' replied debray ; `` you can not make me believe that ; on the contrary , you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count 's . <EOS>	73.72245743638332
<SOS> m. danglars was disagreeable , certainly , but i know how much you care for his ill humor . <EOS>	118.20130912400322
<SOS> someone has vexed you ; i will allow no one to annoy you . '' <EOS>	79.6972077865473
<SOS> `` you are deceived , lucien , i assure you , '' replied madame danglars ; `` and what i have told you is really the case , added to the ill humor you remarked , but which i did not think it worth while to allude to . '' <EOS>	93.48882790527195
<SOS> it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves ; or that , as debray had guessed , she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone . <EOS>	112.65560369928366
<SOS> being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood , he did not then press his inquiries , but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her , or receive an avowal proprio motu . <EOS>	100.2107143379349
<SOS> at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornélie , her confidential maid . <EOS>	78.57840915302295
<SOS> `` what is my daughter doing ? '' <EOS>	84.9943154451028
<SOS> asked madame danglars . <EOS>	100.17530057125437
<SOS> `` she practiced all the evening , and then went to bed , '' replied mademoiselle cornélie . <EOS>	73.16121318173131
<SOS> `` yet i think i hear her piano . '' <EOS>	65.55397179684654
<SOS> `` it is mademoiselle louise d'armilly , who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed . '' <EOS>	76.30419731587865
<SOS> `` well , '' said madame danglars , `` come and undress me . '' <EOS>	112.28073236634364
<SOS> they entered the bedroom . <EOS>	97.80865464007897
<SOS> debray stretched himself upon a large couch , and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle cornélie . <EOS>	82.71374517227686
<SOS> `` my dear m. lucien , '' said madame danglars through the door , `` you are always complaining that eugénie will not address a word to you . '' <EOS>	95.65392850772878
<SOS> `` madame , '' said lucien , playing with a little dog , who , recognizing him as a friend of the house , expected to be caressed , `` i am not the only one who makes similar complaints , i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed . '' <EOS>	65.97991788023171
<SOS> `` true , '' said madame danglars ; `` yet i think this will all pass off , and that you will one day see her enter your study . '' <EOS>	111.74110366321135
<SOS> `` my study ? '' <EOS>	98.3778959856304
<SOS> `` at least that of the minister . '' <EOS>	80.01235913896173
<SOS> `` why so ! '' <EOS>	87.74779743792634
<SOS> `` to ask for an engagement at the opera . <EOS>	65.53997544442747
<SOS> really , i never saw such an infatuation for music ; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion . '' <EOS>	80.24390149445352
<SOS> debray smiled . <EOS>	88.31583544902412
<SOS> `` well , '' said he , `` let her come , with your consent and that of the baron , and we will try and give her an engagement , though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers . '' <EOS>	76.08896592615623
<SOS> `` go , cornélie , '' said madame danglars , `` i do not require you any longer . '' <EOS>	99.21889832391267
<SOS> cornélie obeyed , and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress , and came and sat down close to debray . <EOS>	112.6079333909725
<SOS> then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel . <EOS>	87.21314355882411
<SOS> lucien looked at her for a moment in silence . <EOS>	77.83373384759408
<SOS> `` come , hermine , '' he said , after a short time , `` answer candidly , something vexes you is it not so ? '' <EOS>	68.0871483778125
<SOS> < num > m `` nothing , '' answered the baroness . <EOS>	71.6356385353455
<SOS> and yet , as she could scarcely breathe , she rose and went towards a looking glass . <EOS>	66.15789594919964
<SOS> `` i am frightful tonight , '' she said . <EOS>	69.59072132029684
<SOS> debray rose , smiling , and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point , when the door opened suddenly . <EOS>	87.84782896874631
<SOS> m. danglars appeared ; debray reseated himself . <EOS>	64.17087555911637
<SOS> at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal . <EOS>	87.91076112521242
<SOS> `` good evening , madame , '' said the banker ; `` good evening , m . <EOS>	71.15787523962877
<SOS> debray . '' <EOS>	78.04748554875158
<SOS> probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day . <EOS>	81.0400578029713
<SOS> assuming a dignified air , she turned round to debray , without answering her husband . <EOS>	60.05258261845001
<SOS> `` read me something , m. debray , '' she said . <EOS>	108.69936949116844
<SOS> debray , who was slightly disturbed at this visit , recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness , and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold . <EOS>	75.55880652642688
<SOS> `` excuse me , '' said the banker , `` but you will tire yourself , baroness , by such late hours , and m. debray lives some distance from here . '' <EOS>	103.67836568507464
<SOS> debray was petrified , not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely , but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do . <EOS>	82.50725190626973
<SOS> the baroness was also surprised , and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper , where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations . <EOS>	92.29871935054956
<SOS> the result was , that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose . <EOS>	91.1480337637771
<SOS> `` m. lucien , '' said the baroness , `` i assure you i have no desire to sleep , and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening , which you must listen to , even though you slept while hearing me . '' <EOS>	67.78997606702688
<SOS> `` i am at your service , madame , '' replied lucien coldly . <EOS>	105.84182310851924
<SOS> `` my dear m. debray , '' said the banker , `` do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars , for you can hear them as well tomorrow ; but i claim tonight and will devote it , if you will allow me , to talk over some serious matters with my wife . '' <EOS>	64.85062212251711
<SOS> this time the blow was so well aimed , and hit so directly , that lucien and the baroness were staggered , and they interrogated each other with their eyes , as if to seek help against this aggression , but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed , and the husband was victorious . <EOS>	71.7394178201378
<SOS> `` do not think i wish to turn you out , my dear debray , '' continued danglars ; `` oh , no , not at all . <EOS>	107.46097098795882
<SOS> an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me ; it is so rarely i make such a request , i am sure you can not grudge it to me . '' <EOS>	96.99669030724293
<SOS> debray muttered something , bowed and went out , knocking himself against the edge of the door , like nathan in athalie . <EOS>	64.58164221510445
<SOS> `` it is extraordinary , '' he said , when the door was closed behind him , `` how easily these husbands , whom we ridicule , gain an advantage over us . '' <EOS>	80.6370792232714
<SOS> < num > m lucien having left , danglars took his place on the sofa , closed the open book , and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude , he began playing with the dog ; but the animal , not liking him as well as debray , and attempting to bite him , danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room . <EOS>	108.46635140842372
<SOS> the animal uttered a cry during the transit , but , arrived at its destination , it crouched behind the cushions , and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless . <EOS>	93.15435559804008
<SOS> `` do you know , sir , '' asked the baroness , `` that you are improving ? <EOS>	82.4730884990377
<SOS> generally you are only rude , but tonight you are brutal . '' <EOS>	60.83006526690338
<SOS> `` it is because i am in a worse humor than usual , '' replied danglars . <EOS>	75.82474931657427
<SOS> hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain . <EOS>	95.9861191795865
<SOS> these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars , but this evening he took no notice of them . <EOS>	85.61322899263732
<SOS> `` and what have i to do with your ill humor ? '' <EOS>	106.40358373227502
<SOS> said the baroness , irritated at the impassibility of her husband ; `` do these things concern me ? <EOS>	104.6854036661276
<SOS> keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes , or , since you have clerks whom you pay , vent it upon them . '' <EOS>	90.42350188596481
<SOS> `` not so , '' replied danglars ; `` your advice is wrong , so i shall not follow it . <EOS>	120.60818535404245
<SOS> my money boxes are my pactolus , as , i think , m. demoustier says , and i will not retard its course , or disturb its calm . <EOS>	63.81104819002805
<SOS> my clerks are honest men , who earn my fortune , whom i pay much below their deserts , if i may value them according to what they bring in ; therefore i shall not get into a passion with them ; those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners , mount my horses , and exhaust my fortune . '' <EOS>	72.04656761226701
<SOS> `` and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune ? <EOS>	78.26830306780855
<SOS> explain yourself more clearly , i beg , sir . '' <EOS>	95.60116393866396
<SOS> `` oh , make yourself easy ! <EOS>	97.18320272897424
<SOS> i am not speaking riddles , and you will soon know what i mean . <EOS>	122.15730469345553
<SOS> the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out < num > , < num > francs in the course of an hour . '' <EOS>	81.7810087497846
<SOS> `` i do not understand you , sir , '' said the baroness , trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face . <EOS>	88.0845763822679
<SOS> `` you understand me perfectly , on the contrary , '' said danglars : `` but , if you will persist , i will tell you that i have just lost < num > , < num > francs upon the spanish loan . '' <EOS>	88.5134680989604
<SOS> `` and pray , '' asked the baroness , `` am i responsible for this loss ? '' <EOS>	80.06959170171486
<SOS> `` why not ? '' <EOS>	85.33031051152389
<SOS> `` is it my fault you have lost < num > , < num > francs ? '' <EOS>	76.92938122489356
<SOS> `` certainly it is not mine . '' <EOS>	70.58742252728302
<SOS> `` once for all , sir , '' replied the baroness sharply , `` i tell you i will not hear cash named ; it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband . '' <EOS>	75.38618682814422
<SOS> `` oh , i can well believe that , for neither of them was worth a penny . '' <EOS>	83.00992321464472
<SOS> `` the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank , which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night ; that noise of jingling crowns , which are constantly being counted and re counted , is odious to me . <EOS>	99.71079426307182
<SOS> i only know one thing i dislike more , which is the sound of your voice . '' <EOS>	103.359235182958
<SOS> `` really ? '' <EOS>	75.03138642171626
<SOS> said danglars . <EOS>	63.25320430125432
<SOS> `` well , this surprises me , for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs ! '' <EOS>	79.6205738219821
<SOS> < num > m `` i ? <EOS>	87.17619955888266

<SOS> `` ah ? <EOS>	70.73202675500605
<SOS> what next ? '' <EOS>	105.37072041472692
<SOS> `` most assuredly . '' <EOS>	76.1070967164267
<SOS> `` i should like to know upon what occasion ? '' <EOS>	65.39723549906887
<SOS> `` oh , mon dieu ! <EOS>	68.80079236935377
<SOS> that is very easily done . <EOS>	61.374784126941265
<SOS> last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds . <EOS>	64.86864832445796
<SOS> you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre , that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made . <EOS>	75.80928856860275
<SOS> i know how clear sighted your dreams are ; i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt , and i gained < num > , < num > francs by it , of which < num > , < num > have been honestly paid to you . <EOS>	56.724247452373
<SOS> you spent it as you pleased ; that was your business . <EOS>	103.97622993440397
<SOS> in march there was a question about a grant to a railway . <EOS>	85.38084965054392
<SOS> three companies presented themselves , each offering equal securities . <EOS>	71.49891478628001
<SOS> you told me that your instinct , and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations , i think on the contrary , that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs , well , you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern . <EOS>	76.67284821206995
<SOS> i bought two thirds of the shares of that company ; as you had foreseen , the shares trebled in value , and i picked up a million , from which < num > , < num > francs were paid to you for pin money . <EOS>	94.21055412372421
<SOS> how have you spent this < num > , < num > francs ? <EOS>	68.28459783088805
<SOS> it is no business of mine . '' <EOS>	92.51024398379438
<SOS> `` when are you coming to the point ? '' <EOS>	116.13143441603306
<SOS> cried the baroness , shivering with anger and impatience . <EOS>	98.60489748575698
<SOS> `` patience , madame , i am coming to it . '' <EOS>	105.34975050646824
<SOS> `` that 's fortunate . '' <EOS>	109.8343383835697
<SOS> `` in april you went to dine at the minister 's . <EOS>	88.55132491252117

<SOS> `` well , since i gave you a fourth of my gains , i think you owe me a fourth of my losses ; the fourth of < num > , < num > francs is < num > , < num > francs . '' <EOS>	77.51067530659509
<SOS> `` what you say is absurd , and i can not see why m. debray 's name is mixed up in this affair . '' <EOS>	75.7004044445608

<SOS> she cried , `` will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with ? '' <EOS>	58.53518374000089
<SOS> `` i do not say that i did know it , and i do not say that i did not know it . <EOS>	86.81041085401765

<SOS> some time after our rupture , you wished to study music , under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien ; at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london . <EOS>	81.21470163064167
<SOS> this cost me , on your account and mine , < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	62.68151719884243

<SOS> well , you soon become tired of singing , and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister 's secretary . <EOS>	113.33429373778125
<SOS> you understand , it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box . <EOS>	64.85914205260922

<SOS> `` because you met him at my house , just after his introduction into the world , as they told me . <EOS>	71.6267411745139
<SOS> he has been travelling with a very severe tutor , and had never been to paris before . '' <EOS>	86.1525520828178
<SOS> `` ah , i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves , do they not ? '' <EOS>	88.86653868353672
<SOS> asked danglars carelessly ; `` they like to unite their fortunes . '' <EOS>	73.7837084417721
<SOS> `` it is usual , certainly ; but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people . <EOS>	79.59444771753837
<SOS> i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife . '' <EOS>	72.80180021275497
<SOS> `` do you think so ? '' <EOS>	86.46216444044184
<SOS> `` i am sure of it . '' <EOS>	85.2021633992119
<SOS> `` and you have heard his fortune mentioned ? '' <EOS>	84.61655582210403
<SOS> `` nothing else was talked of ; only some said he was worth millions , and others that he did not possess a farthing . '' <EOS>	81.25623983887253
<SOS> `` and what is your opinion ? '' <EOS>	83.03517014098824
<SOS> `` i ought not to influence you , because it is only my own personal impression . '' <EOS>	88.75985090508775
<SOS> `` well , and it is that `` `` my opinion is , that all these old podestàs , these ancient condottieri , for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces , my opinion , i say , is , that they have buried their millions in corners , the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons , who have done the same from generation to generation ; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance , like the florins of the republic , which , from being constantly gazed upon , have become reflected in them . '' <EOS>	108.68584126690935
<SOS> `` certainly , '' said danglars , `` and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land . '' <EOS>	66.80862896942129
<SOS> `` very little , at least ; i know of none which cavalcanti possesses , excepting his palace in lucca . '' <EOS>	95.43709825329762
<SOS> `` ah , he has a palace ? '' <EOS>	69.19270184416011
<SOS> said danglars , laughing ; `` come , that is something . '' <EOS>	88.90241012237946
<SOS> `` yes ; and more than that , he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house . <EOS>	73.08402484515862

<SOS> `` i scarcely know him ; i think i have seen him three times in my life ; all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself . <EOS>	67.09701110601219
<SOS> he was telling me this morning that , tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy , which is a dead nation , he wished to find a method , either in france or england , of multiplying his millions , but remember , that though i place great confidence in busoni , i am not responsible for this .

<SOS> `` never mind ; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me . <EOS>	63.966534930398424
<SOS> it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers , and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were . <EOS>	73.74232489029269
<SOS> by the way , this is merely a simple question , when this sort of people marry their sons , do they give them any fortune ? '' <EOS>	104.77266426397122
<SOS> `` oh , that depends upon circumstances . <EOS>	76.55199928461087

<SOS> should andrea marry according to his father 's views , he will , perhaps , give him one , two , or three millions . <EOS>	75.26316998725879
<SOS> for example , supposing it were the daughter of a banker , he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son ; then again , if he disliked his choice , the major takes the key , double locks his coffer , and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family , by shuffling cards or rattling the dice .

<SOS> `` ah , that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess ; he will want a crown , an el dorado , and potosí . '' <EOS>	100.3079790970655
<SOS> `` no ; these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families ; like jupiter , they like to cross the race . <EOS>	76.50213133363394

<SOS> `` why did you not invite m. and madame de morcerf to your dinner ? '' <EOS>	95.31589550101546
<SOS> `` i did so , but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air . '' <EOS>	83.41193164461211
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said danglars , laughing , `` it would do her a great deal of good . '' <EOS>	82.6867010107658
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	108.63863303248634
<SOS> `` because it is the air she always breathed in her youth . '' <EOS>	97.02766827585661
<SOS> monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark . <EOS>	74.90400671087734
<SOS> `` but still , if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars , '' said the count , `` you must allow that he has a fine name ? '' <EOS>	88.86290625743436
<SOS> `` so he has ; but i like mine as well . '' <EOS>	82.23554778057913
<SOS> `` certainly ; your name is popular , and does honor to the title they have adorned it with ; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice , too firmly rooted to be exterminated , a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years . '' <EOS>	91.54897711577514
<SOS> `` and for this very reason , '' said danglars with a smile , which he tried to make sardonic , `` i prefer m. andrea cavalcanti to m. albert de morcerf . '' <EOS>	64.45732373796312

<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	79.55489899081662
<SOS> the office of the king 's attorney let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed , and follow madame danglars in her morning excursion . <EOS>	62.72165426742044
<SOS> we have said that at half past twelve o'clock madame danglars had ordered her horses , and had left home in the carriage . <EOS>	74.27435869624368
<SOS> she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain , went down the rue mazarine , and stopped at the passage du pont neuf . <EOS>	66.27395323995987
<SOS> she descended , and went through the passage . <EOS>	82.00100947511628
<SOS> she was very plainly dressed , as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning . <EOS>	105.04280374124303
<SOS> at the rue guénégaud she called a cab , and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay . <EOS>	91.09007023023707
<SOS> as soon as she was seated in the vehicle , she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil , which she tied on to her straw bonnet . <EOS>	69.06951606810581
<SOS> she then replaced the bonnet , and saw with pleasure , in a little pocket mirror , that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible . <EOS>	79.1031435103115
<SOS> the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine ; the driver was paid as the door opened , and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus . <EOS>	78.00597098139949
<SOS> there was a great deal going on that morning , and many business like persons at the palais ; business like persons pay very little attention to women , and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer . <EOS>	109.77490305495002
<SOS> there was a great press of people in m. de villefort 's antechamber , but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name . <EOS>	92.90391299472722
<SOS> the instant she appeared the door keeper rose , came to her , and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment ; and on her affirmative answer being given , he conducted her by a private passage to m. de villefort 's office . <EOS>	76.49549889598464
<SOS> the magistrate was seated in an armchair , writing , with his back towards the door ; he did not move as he heard it open , and the door keeper pronounce the words , `` walk in , madame , '' and then reclose it ; but no sooner had the man 's footsteps ceased , than he started up , drew the bolts , closed the curtains , and examined every corner of the room . <EOS>	66.54853714369207
<SOS> then , when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and was consequently relieved of doubts , he said : `` thanks , madame , thanks for your punctuality ; '' and he offered a chair to madame danglars , which she accepted , for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated . <EOS>	80.3769820579874
<SOS> < num > m `` it is a long time , madame , '' said the procureur , describing a half circle with his chair , so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars , `` it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you , and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation . '' <EOS>	115.51061807698389
<SOS> `` nevertheless , sir , you see i have answered your first appeal , although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you . '' <EOS>	89.74771530529691
<SOS> villefort smiled bitterly . <EOS>	71.35166003130378
<SOS> `` it is true , then , '' he said , rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion , `` it is true , then , that all our actions leave their traces some sad , others bright on our paths ; it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands ; it leaves its track ! <EOS>	78.15887389996026
<SOS> alas , to many the path is traced by tears . '' <EOS>	67.1135679467032
<SOS> `` sir , '' said madame danglars , `` you can feel for my emotion , can you not ? <EOS>	65.43247576625248
<SOS> spare me , then , i beseech you . <EOS>	76.64053461812243
<SOS> when i look at this room , whence so many guilty creatures have departed , trembling and ashamed , when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed , oh , it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge . '' <EOS>	81.95292298813088
<SOS> villefort dropped his head and sighed . <EOS>	102.13892775756668
<SOS> `` and i , '' he said , `` i feel that my place is not in the judge 's seat , but on the prisoner 's bench . '' <EOS>	79.79203829510304
<SOS> < num > m `` you ? '' <EOS>	91.88522015612259
<SOS> said madame danglars . <EOS>	82.82263061225527
<SOS> `` yes , i . '' <EOS>	97.80433433852595
<SOS> `` i think , sir , you exaggerate your situation , '' said madame danglars , whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment . <EOS>	78.43558071564692
<SOS> `` the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations . <EOS>	68.2442860715455
<SOS> besides the pleasure , there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions , and , after all , what have you men to fear from all this ? <EOS>	88.68538444066272
<SOS> the world excuses , and notoriety ennobles you . '' <EOS>	92.18132863435426
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied villefort , `` you know that i am no hypocrite , or , at least , that i never deceive without a reason . <EOS>	93.51144379308447
<SOS> if my brow be severe , it is because many misfortunes have clouded it ; if my heart be petrified , it is that it might sustain the blows it has received . <EOS>	63.83386981001883
<SOS> i was not so in my youth , i was not so on the night of the betrothal , when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles . <EOS>	105.07256629735338
<SOS> but since then everything has changed in and about me ; i am accustomed to brave difficulties , and , in the conflict to crush those who , by their own free will , or by chance , voluntarily or involuntarily , interfere with me in my career . <EOS>	88.95153340083617
<SOS> it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it , or from whom we attempt to snatch it . <EOS>	81.09125297541351
<SOS> thus , the greater number of a man 's errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity ; then , after error has been committed in a moment of excitement , of delirium , or of fear , we see that we might have avoided and escaped it . <EOS>	96.12908285697621
<SOS> the means we might have used , which we in our blindness could not see , then seem simple and easy , and we say , 'why did i not do this , instead of that ? ' <EOS>	71.83982617827739
<SOS> women , on the contrary , are rarely tormented with remorse ; for the decision does not come from you , your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you , and your faults the results of others ' crimes . '' <EOS>	56.31246439325045
<SOS> `` in any case , sir , you will allow , '' replied madame danglars , `` that , even if the fault were alone mine , i last night received a severe punishment for it . '' <EOS>	104.50423429490506
<SOS> `` poor thing , '' said villefort , pressing her hand , `` it was too severe for your strength , for you were twice overwhelmed , and yet `` `` well ? '' <EOS>	119.10012410979772
<SOS> `` well , i must tell you . <EOS>	87.53724094090919

<SOS> `` you only look back to the past , and it is , indeed , bad enough . <EOS>	72.8104834616349
<SOS> well , picture to yourself a future more gloomy still certainly frightful , perhaps sanguinary ! '' <EOS>	95.50957754210592
<SOS> the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was , and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream , but the sound died in her throat . <EOS>	104.81095149580695
<SOS> `` how has this terrible past been recalled ? '' <EOS>	80.68807004003308

<SOS> she again said , as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her . <EOS>	78.91973469470358
<SOS> `` no , '' said villefort , burying his face in his hands , `` no , a hundred times no ! '' <EOS>	97.53665715274305

<SOS> the child was born , was given to me motionless , breathless , voiceless ; we thought it dead . '' <EOS>	73.45696162234067
<SOS> madame danglars moved rapidly , as though she would spring from her chair , but villefort stopped , and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention . <EOS>	75.19012049583563
<SOS> `` we thought it dead , '' he repeated ; `` i placed it in the chest , which was to take the place of a coffin ; i descended to the garden , i dug a hole , and then flung it down in haste . <EOS>	70.69250327101886
<SOS> scarcely had i covered it with earth , when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me ; i saw a shadow rise , and , at the same time , a flash of light . <EOS>	58.264779888483325
<SOS> i felt pain ; i wished to cry out , but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice ; i fell lifeless , and fancied myself killed . <EOS>	73.42647633169177
<SOS> never shall i forget your sublime courage , when , having returned to consciousness , i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs , and you , almost dying yourself , came to meet me . <EOS>	62.727370604993865
<SOS> we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe . <EOS>	83.70771439741826
<SOS> you had the fortitude to regain the house , assisted by your nurse . <EOS>	81.52674700432559
<SOS> a duel was the pretext for my wound . <EOS>	79.131048665856
<SOS> though we scarcely expected it , our secret remained in our own keeping alone . <EOS>	101.6861007466313
<SOS> i was taken to versailles ; for three months i struggled with death ; at last , as i seemed to cling to life , i was ordered to the south . <EOS>	90.82933115434973
<SOS> four men carried me from paris to châlons , walking six leagues a day ; madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage . <EOS>	68.75758897515325
<SOS> at châlons i was put upon the saône , thence i passed on to the rhône , whence i descended , merely with the current , to arles ; at arles i was again placed on my litter , and continued my journey to marseilles . <EOS>	82.15702992131351
<SOS> my recovery lasted six months . <EOS>	110.96822074921549
<SOS> i never heard you mentioned , and i did not dare inquire for you . <EOS>	56.96770784757211
<SOS> when i returned to paris , i learned that you , the widow of m. de nargonne , had married m. danglars . <EOS>	88.55300461060654
<SOS> `` what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me ? <EOS>	68.95810835131822
<SOS> always the same always the child 's corpse , coming every night in my dreams , rising from the earth , and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture . <EOS>	66.06611338467557
<SOS> i inquired immediately on my return to paris ; the house had not been inhabited since we left it , but it had just been let for nine years . <EOS>	98.34626991207365
<SOS> i found the tenant . <EOS>	81.0448473904594
<SOS> i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife 's father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers . <EOS>	64.36072183751332
<SOS> i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease ; they demanded < num > , < num > francs . <EOS>	86.25626830952712
<SOS> i would have given < num > , < num > i would have given < num > , < num > . <EOS>	90.68099456823153
<SOS> i had the money with me ; i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition , and when i had obtained what i so much wanted , i galloped to auteuil . <EOS>	82.87521767497897
<SOS> no one had entered the house since i had left it . <EOS>	64.8595846208361
<SOS> `` it was five o'clock in the afternoon ; i ascended into the red room , and waited for night . <EOS>	79.34046152994227
<SOS> there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force . <EOS>	76.15464404190135
<SOS> the corsican , who had declared the vendetta against me , who had followed me from nîmes to paris , who had hid himself in the garden , who had struck me , had seen me dig the grave , had seen me inter the child , he might become acquainted with your person , nay , he might even then have known it . <EOS>	72.52017772697435
<SOS> would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret ? <EOS>	94.71067866359579
<SOS> would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger ? <EOS>	65.64483574450429
<SOS> it was therefore necessary , before everything else , and at all risks , that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige ; too much reality would always remain in my recollection . <EOS>	105.67176354895092
<SOS> it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting . <EOS>	92.04147521655953
<SOS> `` night arrived ; i allowed it to become quite dark . <EOS>	87.49431086870082

<SOS> i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed , and i dared not turn around . <EOS>	90.20710615887761
<SOS> my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open . <EOS>	82.5550060757479
<SOS> at length , one by one , all the noises in the neighborhood ceased . <EOS>	63.271322324135895
<SOS> i understood that i had nothing to fear , that i should neither be seen nor heard , so i decided upon descending to the garden . <EOS>	62.990338320080696
<SOS> `` listen , hermine ; i consider myself as brave as most men , but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase , which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much , which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door , and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre , i leaned against the wall , and nearly shrieked . <EOS>	108.5069000374273
<SOS> i seemed to be going mad . <EOS>	70.58479253107647
<SOS> at last i mastered my agitation . <EOS>	108.5311558362311
<SOS> i descended the staircase step by step ; the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees . <EOS>	72.2016914390385
<SOS> i grasped the railings ; if i had relaxed my hold for a moment , i should have fallen . <EOS>	87.15626188946645
<SOS> i reached the lower door . <EOS>	85.75150464604023
<SOS> outside this door a spade was placed against the wall ; i took it , and advanced towards the thicket . <EOS>	71.5097321480647
<SOS> i had provided myself with a dark lantern . <EOS>	63.6932391796956
<SOS> in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it , then i continued my path . <EOS>	83.12054051273016
<SOS> `` it was the end of november , all the verdure of the garden had disappeared , the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms , and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet . <EOS>	74.82751960889398
<SOS> my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket , that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself . <EOS>	98.94903616572019
<SOS> i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches . <EOS>	115.05369789149259
<SOS> i examined the thicket with my dark lantern ; it was empty . <EOS>	92.21462643945159
<SOS> i looked carefully around ; i was indeed alone , no noise disturbed the silence but the owl , whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night . <EOS>	75.61442170443962
<SOS> i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole . <EOS>	85.59363036850065
<SOS> `` the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer , and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it . <EOS>	100.59960369879136
<SOS> still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention ; it evidently was there i had turned up the ground . <EOS>	73.46896540769072
<SOS> i went to work . <EOS>	78.61855964651575
<SOS> the hour , then , for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived . <EOS>	99.61252719131203
<SOS> how i worked , how i hoped , how i struck every piece of turf , thinking to find some resistance to my spade ! <EOS>	69.19913548672095
<SOS> but no , i found nothing , though i had made a hole twice as large as the first . <EOS>	84.90411344491429
<SOS> i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot . <EOS>	68.15960863956734
<SOS> i turned around , i looked at the trees , i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time . <EOS>	60.39214482626758
<SOS> a cold , sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches , and yet the drops fell from my forehead . <EOS>	59.319442418338674
<SOS> i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole ; while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum ; behind me was an artificial rockery , intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden ; in falling , my hand , relaxing its hold of the laburnum , felt the coldness of the stone . <EOS>	92.60474370936416
<SOS> on my right i saw the tree , behind me the rock . <EOS>	99.01214562192074
<SOS> i stood in the same attitude , and threw myself down . <EOS>	82.26953932351674
<SOS> i rose , and again began digging and enlarging the hole ; still i found nothing , nothing the chest was no longer there ! '' <EOS>	60.08128742119313

<SOS> `` think not i contented myself with this one effort , '' continued villefort . <EOS>	93.2408691735056
<SOS> `` no ; i searched the whole thicket . <EOS>	107.20747903826248
<SOS> i thought the assassin , having discovered the chest , and supposing it to be a treasure , had intended carrying it off , but , perceiving his error , had dug another hole , and deposited it there ; but i could find nothing . <EOS>	92.12662758346518
<SOS> then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions , and had simply thrown it in a corner . <EOS>	97.65988278901874
<SOS> in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search . <EOS>	105.31486970016392

<SOS> < num > m when daylight dawned i went down again . <EOS>	71.84320562141787
<SOS> my first visit was to the thicket . <EOS>	77.27491980349585
<SOS> i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness . <EOS>	65.78263329194303
<SOS> i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square , and a depth of two feet . <EOS>	98.57588134833854
<SOS> a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour . <EOS>	83.91836947958501
<SOS> but i could find nothing absolutely nothing . <EOS>	73.20138353035749
<SOS> then i renewed the search . <EOS>	80.32665051321855
<SOS> supposing it had been thrown aside , it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate ; but this examination was as useless as the first , and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket , which now contained no hope for me . '' <EOS>	67.76015548091388
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried madame danglars , `` it was enough to drive you mad ! '' <EOS>	75.17987532501905
<SOS> `` i hoped for a moment that it might , '' said villefort ; `` but that happiness was denied me . <EOS>	102.17061725368976
<SOS> however , recovering my strength and my ideas , 'why , ' said i , 'should that man have carried away the corpse ? ' '' <EOS>	69.56363690663163
<SOS> `` but you said , '' replied madame danglars , `` he would require it as a proof . '' <EOS>	86.91413752172068
<SOS> `` ah , no , madame , that could not be . <EOS>	73.33673410327974

<SOS> now , nothing of the kind has happened . '' <EOS>	106.26892893727853
<SOS> `` what then ? '' <EOS>	102.92596589604133
<SOS> asked hermine , trembling violently . <EOS>	74.16408919533596
<SOS> `` something more terrible , more fatal , more alarming for us the child was , perhaps , alive , and the assassin may have saved it ! '' <EOS>	100.8754069513807
<SOS> madame danglars uttered a piercing cry , and , seizing villefort 's hands , exclaimed , `` my child was alive ? '' <EOS>	78.54314893100896
<SOS> said she ; `` you buried my child alive ? <EOS>	96.95834011445287
<SOS> you were not certain my child was dead , and you buried it ? <EOS>	105.19034382165216
<SOS> ah `` madame danglars had risen , and stood before the procureur , whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp . <EOS>	72.13755770527044
<SOS> `` i know not ; i merely suppose so , as i might suppose anything else , '' replied villefort with a look so fixed , it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness . <EOS>	95.2953259449686
<SOS> `` ah , my child , my poor child ! '' <EOS>	106.3516782325695
<SOS> cried the baroness , falling on her chair , and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief . <EOS>	67.22824458508207
<SOS> villefort , becoming somewhat reassured , perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head , he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt . <EOS>	117.82702986584599
<SOS> `` you understand , then , that if it were so , '' said he , rising in his turn , and approaching the baroness , to speak to her in a lower tone , `` we are lost . <EOS>	64.30025616649452

<SOS> `` just god , avenging god ! '' <EOS>	67.85478648054715
<SOS> murmured madame danglars . <EOS>	71.96220815385816

<SOS> `` how i have searched for him , '' replied villefort , wringing his hands ; `` how i have called him in my long sleepless nights ; how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men , and to find mine among them ! <EOS>	82.50810532076883
<SOS> at last , one day , when for the hundredth time i took up my spade , i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child . <EOS>	61.21596994995759
<SOS> a child encumbers a fugitive ; perhaps , on perceiving it was still alive , he had thrown it into the river . '' <EOS>	104.83691649559577

<SOS> the count watched albert , waving his hand to him . <EOS>	68.91265808516908
<SOS> when he had mounted his phaeton , monte cristo turned , and seeing bertuccio , `` what news ? '' <EOS>	81.88393400124575
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	60.373860985008626
<SOS> `` she went to the palais , '' replied the steward . <EOS>	93.0685111454548

<SOS> `` well , my dear bertuccio , '' said the count , `` i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy . '' <EOS>	75.01795299414538
<SOS> bertuccio bowed , and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received , he started the same evening . <EOS>	77.82761690718789
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	95.94798254520019
<SOS> the inquiry m. de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars , to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil . <EOS>	83.30003862482356
<SOS> he wrote the same day for the required information to m. de boville , who , from having been an inspector of prisons , was promoted to a high office in the police ; and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars . <EOS>	57.645696789186914
<SOS> at the end of the second day m. de villefort received the following note : `` the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore , a rich foreigner , who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment ; he is also known to the abbé busoni , a sicilian priest , of high repute in the east , where he has done much good . '' <EOS>	78.06238663693964
<SOS> m. de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons ; his orders were executed , and the following evening he received these details : `` the abbé , who was in paris only for a month , inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice ; there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant . <EOS>	117.29000161375191
<SOS> the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room , with a table , chairs , and side board of walnut , and a wainscoted parlor , without ornaments , carpet , or timepiece . <EOS>	81.07841239848081
<SOS> it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity . <EOS>	65.58653352339037
<SOS> he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs , which was more library than parlor , and was furnished with theological books and parchments , in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time , according to his valet de chambre . <EOS>	113.20023532034247
<SOS> his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket ; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him , he replied that the abbé was not in paris , an answer which satisfied most persons , because the abbé was known to be a great traveller . <EOS>	79.97067362594697
<SOS> besides , whether at home or not , whether in paris or cairo , the abbé always left something to give away , which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master 's name . <EOS>	92.18275018924466
<SOS> the other room near the library was a bedroom . <EOS>	63.99797095831462
<SOS> a bed without curtains , four armchairs , and a couch , covered with yellow utrecht velvet , composed , with a prie dieu , all its furniture . <EOS>	68.54726727785919
<SOS> `` lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges . <EOS>	81.25656527466671
<SOS> he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling . <EOS>	81.05644736004838
<SOS> he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished , passed only a few hours in the day there , and rarely slept there . <EOS>	88.33644099239815
<SOS> one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french , which he however wrote with great facility . '' <EOS>	76.50963778379166
<SOS> the day after this important information had been given to the king 's attorney , a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou , and rapping at an olive green door , asked if the abbé busoni were within . <EOS>	100.18464641892683
<SOS> `` no , he went out early this morning , '' replied the valet . <EOS>	73.00952562407124
<SOS> `` i might not always be content with that answer , '' replied the visitor , `` for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home . <EOS>	106.17638482065753
<SOS> but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni `` `` i told you he was not at home , '' repeated the valet . <EOS>	78.83395296669055
<SOS> `` then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper . <EOS>	112.20273034640203
<SOS> will he be at home at eight o'clock this evening ? '' <EOS>	119.55952973654516
<SOS> `` doubtless , unless he is at work , which is the same as if he were out . '' <EOS>	89.03698041039141
<SOS> `` i will come again at that time , '' replied the visitor , who then retired . <EOS>	56.65825356826161
<SOS> at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage , which , instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou , drove up to the green door . <EOS>	88.6084877772091
<SOS> he knocked , and it opened immediately to admit him . <EOS>	88.74856065268146
<SOS> from the signs of respect the valet paid him , he saw that his note had produced a good effect . <EOS>	77.83436998941553
<SOS> `` is the abbé at home ? '' <EOS>	110.13409250207498
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	99.39263379300306
<SOS> `` yes ; he is at work in his library , but he expects you , sir , '' replied the valet . <EOS>	101.14014306419605
<SOS> the stranger ascended a rough staircase , and before a table , illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness , he perceived the abbé in a monk 's dress , with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages . <EOS>	86.510423631357
<SOS> `` have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni ? '' <EOS>	90.33077860952618
<SOS> asked the visitor . <EOS>	67.52146783494173
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the abbé ; `` and you are the person whom m. de boville , formerly an inspector of prisons , sends to me from the prefect of police ? '' <EOS>	76.25972956003658
<SOS> `` exactly , sir . '' <EOS>	60.2158211180986
<SOS> `` one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris ? '' <EOS>	90.66177006732883
<SOS> `` yes , sir '' replied the stranger with a slight hesitation , and blushing . <EOS>	89.01804936908091
<SOS> the abbé replaced the large spectacles , which covered not only his eyes but his temples , and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same . <EOS>	61.96512760592323
<SOS> `` i am at your service , sir , '' said the abbé , with a marked italian accent . <EOS>	71.25316103922502
<SOS> `` the mission with which i am charged , sir , '' replied the visitor , speaking with hesitation , `` is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it , and him by whom he is employed . '' <EOS>	91.77996980844694
<SOS> the abbé bowed . <EOS>	99.5140413087386
<SOS> `` your probity , '' replied the stranger , `` is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety , to ascertain which i am deputed to see you . <EOS>	95.12486143732986
<SOS> it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth . '' <EOS>	92.27661292835795
<SOS> `` provided , sir , the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience . <EOS>	83.2506471669665
<SOS> i am a priest , sir , and the secrets of confession , for instance , must remain between me and god , and not between me and human justice . '' <EOS>	84.64464462387197
<SOS> `` do not alarm yourself , monsieur , we will duly respect your conscience . '' <EOS>	85.18110381961411
<SOS> at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other , throwing a bright light on the stranger 's face , while his own remained obscured . <EOS>	96.14198389997152
<SOS> `` excuse me , abbé , '' said the envoy of the prefect of the police , `` but the light tries my eyes very much . '' <EOS>	66.2381389338501
<SOS> the abbé lowered the shade . <EOS>	82.34446074206575
<SOS> `` now , sir , i am listening go on . '' <EOS>	82.71383458679394
<SOS> `` i will come at once to the point . <EOS>	113.52082421032968

<SOS> `` well , be it so let us not dispute about words ; and since m. de monte cristo and m. zaccone are the same `` `` absolutely the same . '' <EOS>	101.79766037718434
<SOS> `` let us speak of m . <EOS>	80.52653555887444

<SOS> `` the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta . '' <EOS>	82.89098327756125
<SOS> `` i know that is the report ; but , as you are aware , the police does not content itself with vague reports . '' <EOS>	106.90830049889355
<SOS> `` however , '' replied the abbé , with an affable smile , `` when that report is in accordance with the truth , everybody must believe it , the police as well as all the rest . '' <EOS>	75.39956790505987
<SOS> `` are you sure of what you assert ? '' <EOS>	91.6205629108301
<SOS> `` what do you mean by that question ? '' <EOS>	66.45965205890562
<SOS> `` understand , sir , i do not in the least suspect your veracity ; i ask if you are certain of it ? '' <EOS>	72.41690943809739

<SOS> `` that is reasonable , '' said the visitor ; `` i have heard he had three or four millions . '' <EOS>	109.90402680137744

<SOS> an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered , and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges , and stopped at no . <EOS>	81.24908127486572
<SOS> < num > , where lord wilmore lived . <EOS>	101.1932606133134
<SOS> the stranger had written to lord wilmore , requesting an interview , which the latter had fixed for ten o'clock . <EOS>	87.6795145621833
<SOS> as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten , he was told that lord wilmore , who was precision and punctuality personified , was not yet come in , but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck . <EOS>	89.28969624517971
<SOS> the visitor was introduced into the drawing room , which was like all other furnished drawing rooms . <EOS>	81.88000110521118
<SOS> a mantle piece , with two modern sèvres vases , a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow , a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide , the other , belisarius begging a grayish paper ; red and black tapestry such was the appearance of lord wilmore 's drawing room . <EOS>	79.30045154367741
<SOS> it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light , as if out of consideration for the envoy 's weak sight . <EOS>	62.62753465496829
<SOS> after ten minutes ' expectation the clock struck ten ; at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared . <EOS>	70.13217284975863
<SOS> he was rather above the middle height , with thin reddish whiskers , light complexion and light hair , turning rather gray . <EOS>	80.54359576036138
<SOS> he was dressed with all the english peculiarity , namely , in a blue coat , with gilt buttons and high collar , in the fashion of < num > , a white kerseymere waistcoat , and nankeen pantaloons , three inches too short , but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee . <EOS>	83.365266532751
<SOS> his first remark on entering was : `` you know , sir , i do not speak french ? '' <EOS>	83.57160903478248
<SOS> `` i know you do not like to converse in our language , '' replied the envoy . <EOS>	88.08104481686922
<SOS> `` but you may use it , '' replied lord wilmore ; `` i understand it . '' <EOS>	103.25129129142812

<SOS> `` aw ? '' <EOS>	83.73088328673535
<SOS> said lord wilmore , with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain . <EOS>	65.81554218276688
<SOS> the envoy presented his letter of introduction , which the latter read with english coolness , and having finished : `` i understand , '' said he , `` perfectly . '' <EOS>	68.66981379662566
<SOS> < num > m then began the questions , which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni . <EOS>	116.65466867342953
<SOS> but as lord wilmore , in the character of the count 's enemy , was less restrained in his answers , they were more numerous ; he described the youth of monte cristo , who he said , at ten years of age , entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english . <EOS>	76.9103431480942
<SOS> it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him ; and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner , sent to england , and consigned to the hulks , whence he had escaped by swimming . <EOS>	66.60307329462817
<SOS> then began his travels , his duels , his caprices ; then the insurrection in greece broke out , and he had served in the grecian ranks . <EOS>	107.54387640097573
<SOS> while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly , but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone . <EOS>	93.56598133578024
<SOS> after the battle of navarino , when the greek government was consolidated , he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district , which was given him . <EOS>	102.54872094648887
<SOS> hence that immense fortune , which , in lord wilmore 's opinion , possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum , a precarious fortune , which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine . <EOS>	94.58655146580068
<SOS> `` but , '' asked the visitor , `` do you know why he came to france ? '' <EOS>	117.02409478269627
<SOS> `` he is speculating in railways , '' said lord wilmore , `` and as he is an expert chemist and physicist , he has invented a new system of telegraphy , which he is seeking to bring to perfection . '' <EOS>	81.73764632684119
<SOS> `` how much does he spend yearly ? '' <EOS>	77.56931264330798
<SOS> asked the prefect . <EOS>	102.45490062281124
<SOS> `` not more than five or six hundred thousand francs , '' said lord wilmore ; `` he is a miser . '' <EOS>	111.5615542208292
<SOS> hatred evidently inspired the englishman , who , knowing no other reproach to bring on the count , accused him of avarice . <EOS>	84.7648517878929
<SOS> `` do you know his house at auteuil ? '' <EOS>	75.96550076338285
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	82.80049437729197
<SOS> `` what do you know respecting it ? '' <EOS>	90.12466830379631
<SOS> `` do you wish to know why he bought it ? '' <EOS>	93.3444355731075
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	103.06375132843051
<SOS> `` the count is a speculator , who will certainly ruin himself in experiments . <EOS>	117.24230600841308
<SOS> he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères , luchon , and cauterets . <EOS>	90.54571047852613
<SOS> he is going to turn his house into a badhaus , as the germans term it . <EOS>	110.68852513846134
<SOS> he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring , and , being unsuccessful , he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses . <EOS>	114.57717137199532
<SOS> now , as i dislike him , and hope his railway , his electric telegraph , or his search for baths , will ruin him , i am watching for his discomfiture , which must soon take place . '' <EOS>	88.39186242092126
<SOS> `` what was the cause of your quarrel ? '' <EOS>	105.70311700399468
<SOS> `` when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends . '' <EOS>	69.17838266528264
<SOS> `` why do you not seek revenge ? '' <EOS>	106.895199882391
<SOS> `` i have already fought three duels with him , '' said the englishman , `` the first with the pistol , the second with the sword , and the third with the sabre . '' <EOS>	61.83474729317927
<SOS> `` and what was the result of those duels ? '' <EOS>	103.71084448702375
<SOS> `` the first time , he broke my arm ; the second , he wounded me in the breast ; and the third time , made this large wound . '' <EOS>	99.73354420063859
<SOS> the englishman turned down his shirt collar , and showed a scar , whose redness proved it to be a recent one . <EOS>	98.72328875588532
<SOS> `` so that , you see , there is a deadly feud between us . '' <EOS>	60.66261482607127
<SOS> `` but , '' said the envoy , `` you do not go about it in the right way to kill him , if i understand you correctly . '' <EOS>	76.41232313364989
<SOS> `` aw ? '' <EOS>	124.32774656740698
<SOS> said the englishman , `` i practice shooting every day , and every other day grisier comes to my house . '' <EOS>	79.88860606091419
<SOS> this was all the visitor wished to ascertain , or , rather , all the englishman appeared to know . <EOS>	54.62663181290447
<SOS> the agent arose , and having bowed to lord wilmore , who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english , he retired . <EOS>	76.69807169391251
<SOS> lord wilmore , having heard the door close after him , returned to his bedroom , where with one hand he pulled off his light hair , his red whiskers , his false jaw , and his wound , to resume the black hair , dark complexion , and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo . <EOS>	87.59221673183893
<SOS> it was m. de villefort , and not the prefect , who returned to the house of m. de villefort . <EOS>	94.9925400395209
<SOS> the procureur felt more at ease , although he had learned nothing really satisfactory , and , for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil , he slept soundly . <EOS>	90.18258870081421
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	98.72937873913307
<SOS> the ball it was in the warmest days of july , when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m. de morcerf 's . <EOS>	91.9664281771256
<SOS> it was ten o'clock at night ; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count 's house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven , which was studded with golden stars , but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered . <EOS>	88.77126985535052
<SOS> from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music , with the whirl of the waltz and galop , while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds . <EOS>	58.05376640892949
<SOS> at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants , who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper , the serenity of the weather continuing to increase . <EOS>	85.62723137459334
<SOS> until now , it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room , or under a long tent erected on the lawn , but the beautiful blue sky , studded with stars , had settled the question in favor of the lawn . <EOS>	91.2029504141859
<SOS> the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns , according to the italian custom , and , as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood , the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers . <EOS>	87.32371500037449
<SOS> < num > m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms , after giving her orders , many guests were arriving , more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count ; for , owing to the good taste of mercédès , one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing , or even copying in case of need . <EOS>	68.89590826431613
<SOS> madame danglars , in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety , had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf 's , when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort . <EOS>	64.83226984473676
<SOS> the latter made a sign , and when the carriages had drawn close together , said : `` you are going to madame de morcerf 's , are you not ? '' <EOS>	74.4225438116028
<SOS> `` no , '' replied madame danglars , `` i am too ill. '' `` you are wrong , '' replied villefort , significantly ; `` it is important that you should be seen there . '' <EOS>	92.61144528607907
<SOS> `` do you think so ? '' <EOS>	60.56677175997582
<SOS> asked the baroness . <EOS>	56.919204261206225
<SOS> `` i do . '' <EOS>	67.25538516855937
<SOS> `` in that case i will go . '' <EOS>	91.00024023408942
<SOS> and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations . <EOS>	69.99854632757256
<SOS> madame danglars therefore came , not only beautiful in person , but radiant with splendor ; she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door . <EOS>	76.19991889218754
<SOS> the countess took albert to meet madame danglars . <EOS>	92.6782056502587
<SOS> he approached , paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet , and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat . <EOS>	100.94204905239145
<SOS> albert looked around him . <EOS>	109.51054569758489
<SOS> `` you are looking for my daughter ? '' <EOS>	93.91270693454811
<SOS> said the baroness , smiling . <EOS>	80.67133493981298
<SOS> `` i confess it , '' replied albert . <EOS>	80.64428708923113
<SOS> `` could you have been so cruel as not to bring her ? '' <EOS>	75.74263894261556
<SOS> `` calm yourself . <EOS>	80.69252354995699
<SOS> she has met mademoiselle de villefort , and has taken her arm ; see , they are following us , both in white dresses , one with a bouquet of camellias , the other with one of myosotis . <EOS>	107.47702754974716
<SOS> but tell me `` `` well , what do you wish to know ? '' <EOS>	61.36720542616774
<SOS> `` will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight ? '' <EOS>	82.31910438897003
<SOS> `` seventeen ! '' <EOS>	97.02963063330108
<SOS> replied albert . <EOS>	70.39430351059734
<SOS> `` what do you mean ? '' <EOS>	93.73121110959704
<SOS> `` i only mean that the count seems the rage , '' replied the viscount , smiling , `` and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question . <EOS>	73.47951616522491
<SOS> the count is in fashion ; i congratulate him upon it . '' <EOS>	93.42053449769826
<SOS> `` and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ? '' <EOS>	88.46778233691562
<SOS> `` ah , to be sure , i have not answered you ; be satisfied , we shall have this 'lion ' ; we are among the privileged ones . '' <EOS>	74.55729551568697
<SOS> `` were you at the opera yesterday ? '' <EOS>	75.75825459961551
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	71.73096714350318
<SOS> `` he was there . '' <EOS>	86.44324340852019
<SOS> `` ah , indeed ? <EOS>	69.22810905303757
<SOS> and did the eccentric person commit any new originality ? '' <EOS>	67.69266892882001
<SOS> `` can he be seen without doing so ? <EOS>	112.16297108765613
<SOS> elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux ; the greek princess was in ecstasies . <EOS>	68.19344237669206
<SOS> after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet , and threw it to the charming danseuse , who , in the third act , to do honor to the gift , reappeared with it on her finger . <EOS>	66.82706355960956
<SOS> and the greek princess , will she be here ? '' <EOS>	61.458664537380244
<SOS> `` no , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count 's establishment is not sufficiently understood . '' <EOS>	67.47050044479795
<SOS> `` wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to madame de villefort , who is trying to attract your attention . '' <EOS>	99.17595041590388
<SOS> albert bowed to madame danglars , and advanced towards madame de villefort , whose lips opened as he approached . <EOS>	104.63965759661598
<SOS> `` i wager anything , '' said albert , interrupting her , `` that i know what you were about to say . '' <EOS>	90.42545831052108
<SOS> `` well , what is it ? '' <EOS>	98.77445668326804
<SOS> `` if i guess rightly , will you confess it ? '' <EOS>	93.26624359509375
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	96.5040058658247
<SOS> `` on your honor ? '' <EOS>	70.57580759749811
<SOS> `` on my honor . '' <EOS>	76.94707986670477
<SOS> `` you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived , or was expected . '' <EOS>	76.7872328277376
<SOS> `` not at all . <EOS>	111.41880849052748
<SOS> it is not of him that i am now thinking . <EOS>	72.55072991197649
<SOS> i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz . '' <EOS>	94.34533186048402
<SOS> `` yes , yesterday . '' <EOS>	79.48072169280071
<SOS> `` what did he tell you ? '' <EOS>	87.61283746489804
<SOS> `` that he was leaving at the same time as his letter . '' <EOS>	81.25883816442453
<SOS> `` well , now then , the count ? '' <EOS>	96.96072332665595
<SOS> `` the count will come , of that you may be satisfied . '' <EOS>	114.5606590342733
<SOS> `` you know that he has another name besides monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	89.13483395622444
<SOS> `` no , i did not know it . '' <EOS>	88.70536279407024
<SOS> `` monte cristo is the name of an island , and he has a family name . '' <EOS>	78.1873267188491
<SOS> `` i never heard it . '' <EOS>	111.42217437956852
<SOS> `` well , then , i am better informed than you ; his name is zaccone . '' <EOS>	89.29003186977657
<SOS> `` it is possible . '' <EOS>	68.73924985639957
<SOS> `` he is a maltese . '' <EOS>	100.73594410546568
<SOS> `` that is also possible . <EOS>	76.14574369797099
<SOS> `` the son of a shipowner . '' <EOS>	85.240298706748
<SOS> `` really , you should relate all this aloud , you would have the greatest success . '' <EOS>	75.31382175062376
<SOS> `` he served in india , discovered a mine in thessaly , and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil . '' <EOS>	74.63295335443314
<SOS> `` well , i 'm sure , '' said morcerf , `` this is indeed news ! <EOS>	102.95731010358809
<SOS> am i allowed to repeat it ? '' <EOS>	111.92879385645716
<SOS> `` yes , but cautiously , tell one thing at a time , and do not say i told you . '' <EOS>	70.07962572329892
<SOS> `` why so ? '' <EOS>	74.91882250257935
<SOS> `` because it is a secret just discovered . '' <EOS>	60.59553156391573
<SOS> `` by whom ? '' <EOS>	73.54357925405344
<SOS> `` the police . '' <EOS>	105.1864896140221
<SOS> `` then the news originated `` `` at the prefect 's last night . <EOS>	106.3589744446902
<SOS> paris , you can understand , is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor , and the police have made inquiries . '' <EOS>	98.74510167802994
<SOS> `` well , well ! <EOS>	97.37923412739406
<SOS> nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond , on the pretext of his being too rich . '' <EOS>	76.59913669298794
<SOS> `` indeed , that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable . '' <EOS>	94.95557552459749
<SOS> `` poor count ! <EOS>	88.94548599121083
<SOS> and is he aware of the danger he has been in ? '' <EOS>	75.82210764515777
<SOS> `` i think not . '' <EOS>	106.32511916650482
<SOS> `` then it will be but charitable to inform him . <EOS>	67.30328687975047
<SOS> when he arrives , i will not fail to do so . '' <EOS>	119.5943870979805
<SOS> just then , a handsome young man , with bright eyes , black hair , and glossy moustache , respectfully bowed to madame de villefort . <EOS>	98.7357371366962
<SOS> albert extended his hand . <EOS>	106.00885873205361
<SOS> `` madame , '' said albert , `` allow me to present to you m. maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , one of our best , and , above all , of our bravest officers . '' <EOS>	78.37492213063688
<SOS> `` i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil , at the house of the count of monte cristo , '' replied madame de villefort , turning away with marked coldness of manner . <EOS>	55.9946423744095
<SOS> this answer , and especially the tone in which it was uttered , chilled the heart of poor morrel . <EOS>	94.2061807418751
<SOS> but a recompense was in store for him ; turning around , he saw near the door a beautiful fair face , whose large blue eyes were , without any marked expression , fixed upon him , while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips . <EOS>	90.65423390031793
<SOS> the salutation was so well understood that morrel , with the same expression in his eyes , placed his handkerchief to his mouth ; and these two living statues , whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect , separated from each other by the whole length of the room , forgot themselves for a moment , or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation . <EOS>	81.8231102486345
<SOS> they might have remained much longer lost in one another , without anyone noticing their abstraction . <EOS>	80.03882703147816
<SOS> the count of monte cristo had just entered . <EOS>	54.36837587748616
<SOS> we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared . <EOS>	82.28352651818946
<SOS> it was not the coat , unexceptional in its cut , though simple and unornamented ; it was not the plain white waistcoat ; it was not the trousers , that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention , it was his pale complexion , his waving black hair , his calm and serene expression , his dark and melancholy eye , his mouth , chiselled with such marvellous delicacy , which so easily expressed such high disdain , these were what fixed the attention of all upon him . <EOS>	92.65878767900723
<SOS> many men might have been handsomer , but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant , if the expression may be used . <EOS>	77.34951741414277
<SOS> everything about the count seemed to have its meaning , for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face , and even to the most trifling gesture , scarcely to be understood . <EOS>	60.733112044204404
<SOS> yet the parisian world is so strange , that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune . <EOS>	77.69798638534442
<SOS> < num > m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf , who , standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers , had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door , and was prepared to receive him . <EOS>	78.58849786508951
<SOS> she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her . <EOS>	85.35168045070863
<SOS> no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her , while on his side the count thought she was about to address him ; but both remained silent , and after a mere bow , monte cristo directed his steps to albert , who received him cordially . <EOS>	117.56665078810614
<SOS> `` have you seen my mother ? '' <EOS>	108.70812734138705
<SOS> asked albert . <EOS>	62.89160785464757
<SOS> `` i have just had the pleasure , '' replied the count ; `` but i have not seen your father . '' <EOS>	75.58345145894727
<SOS> `` see , he is down there , talking politics with that little group of great geniuses . '' <EOS>	82.357707212599
<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	114.9829933126552
<SOS> said monte cristo ; `` and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent . <EOS>	95.07579863356678
<SOS> i should not have guessed it . <EOS>	95.49203354529232
<SOS> and for what kind of talent are they celebrated ? <EOS>	70.76097690782548
<SOS> you know there are different sorts . '' <EOS>	103.73844001931899
<SOS> `` that tall , harsh looking man is very learned , he discovered , in the neighborhood of rome , a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have , and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute . <EOS>	80.72106869126775
<SOS> the thing was discussed for a long time , but finally decided in his favor . <EOS>	93.21661854980103
<SOS> i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world , and the gentleman , who was only a knight of the legion of honor , was made an officer . '' <EOS>	109.98693250354863
<SOS> `` come , '' said monte cristo , `` this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded . <EOS>	77.30847218087958
<SOS> i suppose , had he found another additional vertebra , they would have made him a commander . '' <EOS>	90.78660662243114
<SOS> `` very likely , '' said albert . <EOS>	64.38904299467664
<SOS> `` and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green ? '' <EOS>	74.01758540362215
<SOS> `` oh , that coat is not his own idea ; it is the republic 's , which deputed david < num > to devise a uniform for the academicians . '' <EOS>	69.5929860422393
<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	59.200504772563434
<SOS> said monte cristo ; `` so this gentleman is an academician ? '' <EOS>	97.36739533183429
<SOS> `` within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly . '' <EOS>	82.65549929366227
<SOS> `` and what is his especial talent ? '' <EOS>	82.25292951822598
<SOS> `` his talent ? <EOS>	79.63896520764673
<SOS> i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits , he makes fowls eat madder , and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone . '' <EOS>	108.10242891289622
<SOS> `` and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this ? '' <EOS>	90.35709251121642
<SOS> `` no ; of the french academy . '' <EOS>	84.43538659671633

<SOS> albert had left the count to speak to his mother , danglars to converse with young cavalcanti ; monte cristo was for an instant alone . <EOS>	77.97529467537555
<SOS> meanwhile the heat became excessive . <EOS>	97.34973914251817
<SOS> the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices . <EOS>	92.68781678341169

<SOS> albert kissed his mother 's hand , and drew near the count . <EOS>	65.7145890044102
<SOS> another salver passed , loaded like the preceding ones ; she saw albert attempt to persuade the count , but he obstinately refused . <EOS>	74.50162343129553
<SOS> albert rejoined his mother ; she was very pale . <EOS>	89.4290212441105

<SOS> `` oh , no ; i have seen him eat of everything in italy ; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening . '' <EOS>	93.54957941656382

<SOS> `` i do not think that , for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated , and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows . '' <EOS>	99.25127600786566
<SOS> `` in a word , '' said mercédès , `` it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended . '' <EOS>	97.8817495594331
<SOS> and she left the room . <EOS>	68.2016622181085
<SOS> a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open , and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns , and the supper laid under the tent . <EOS>	85.966849191855
<SOS> dancers , players , talkers , all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in . <EOS>	88.61552454079487
<SOS> at the same time mercédès reappeared , paler than before , but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore . <EOS>	63.638528789194595
<SOS> she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre . <EOS>	99.37106592220752
<SOS> `` do not detain those gentlemen here , count , '' she said ; `` they would prefer , i should think , to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here , since they are not playing . '' <EOS>	70.24212766682824
<SOS> `` ah , '' said a gallant old general , who , in < num > , had sung partant pour la syrie , `` we will not go alone to the garden . '' <EOS>	92.40380403304309
<SOS> `` then , '' said mercédès , `` i will lead the way . '' <EOS>	84.55356191043651
<SOS> turning towards monte cristo , she added , `` count , will you oblige me with your arm ? '' <EOS>	67.84520333425586
<SOS> the count almost staggered at these simple words ; then he fixed his eyes on mercédès . <EOS>	76.64045915392991
<SOS> it was only a momentary glance , but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century , so much was expressed in that one look . <EOS>	104.75833684655069
<SOS> he offered his arm to the countess ; she took it , or rather just touched it with her little hand , and they together descended the steps , lined with rhododendrons and camellias . <EOS>	87.33312629959102
<SOS> behind them , by another outlet , a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight . <EOS>	81.02101959141211

<SOS> bread and salt madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion . <EOS>	55.264804428371534
<SOS> it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory . <EOS>	92.60773490592514
<SOS> `` it was too warm in the room , was it not , count ? '' <EOS>	64.16346618977158
<SOS> she asked . <EOS>	87.72358601164792
<SOS> `` yes , madame ; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds . '' <EOS>	80.56340016362108
<SOS> as he ceased speaking , the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble . <EOS>	77.58841148954373
<SOS> `` but you , '' he said , `` with that light dress , and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf , perhaps you feel cold ? '' <EOS>	80.21326184149765
<SOS> `` do you know where i am leading you ? '' <EOS>	72.6572496031432
<SOS> said the countess , without replying to the question . <EOS>	88.35019775396962
<SOS> `` no , madame , '' replied monte cristo ; `` but you see i make no resistance . '' <EOS>	63.290232657410485
<SOS> `` we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove . '' <EOS>	95.68386619262056
<SOS> the count looked at mercédès as if to interrogate her , but she continued to walk on in silence , and he refrained from speaking . <EOS>	74.37134259410801
<SOS> they reached the building , ornamented with magnificent fruits , which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun , so frequently absent in our climate . <EOS>	72.62522477505138
<SOS> the countess left the arm of monte cristo , and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes . <EOS>	63.62243745177468
<SOS> `` see , count , '' she said , with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids `` see , our french grapes are not to be compared , i know , with yours of sicily and cyprus , but you will make allowance for our northern sun . '' <EOS>	72.18462681809112
<SOS> the count bowed , but stepped back . <EOS>	108.65555659324436
<SOS> `` do you refuse ? '' <EOS>	108.5294623788306
<SOS> said mercédès , in a tremulous voice . <EOS>	97.53294332945718
<SOS> `` pray excuse me , madame , '' replied monte cristo , `` but i never eat muscatel grapes . '' <EOS>	64.04916342957162
<SOS> mercédès let them fall , and sighed . <EOS>	73.563317288523
<SOS> a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall , ripened by the same artificial heat . <EOS>	87.89263415344553
<SOS> mercédès drew near , and plucked the fruit . <EOS>	77.20048174446397
<SOS> `` take this peach , then , '' she said . <EOS>	98.73193337584398
<SOS> the count again refused . <EOS>	87.54408273228024
<SOS> `` what , again ? '' <EOS>	79.41403158266304
<SOS> she exclaimed , in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob ; `` really , you pain me . '' <EOS>	70.78149849733589
<SOS> a long silence followed ; the peach , like the grapes , fell to the ground . <EOS>	74.97443767333583
<SOS> `` count , '' added mercédès with a supplicating glance , `` there is a beautiful arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof . '' <EOS>	78.47587908193134
<SOS> `` i know it , madame , '' replied the count ; `` but we are in france , and not in arabia , and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another . '' <EOS>	116.38028972391953
<SOS> `` but , '' said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on monte cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , `` we are friends , are we not ? '' <EOS>	95.14249764331711
<SOS> the count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson ; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled . <EOS>	71.81974055571592
<SOS> `` certainly , we are friends , '' he replied ; `` why should we not be ? '' <EOS>	106.74625248278906
<SOS> the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired , that she turned away to give vent to a sigh , which sounded more like a groan . <EOS>	96.34171729574685
<SOS> `` thank you , '' she said . <EOS>	79.72491999845091
<SOS> and they walked on again . <EOS>	90.02815765646035
<SOS> they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word . <EOS>	86.26145141294913
<SOS> `` sir , '' suddenly exclaimed the countess , after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence , `` is it true that you have seen so much , travelled so far , and suffered so deeply ? '' <EOS>	84.56252457570555

<SOS> `` but now you are happy ? '' <EOS>	79.13479800330927

<SOS> `` and your present happiness , has it softened your heart ? '' <EOS>	71.31240533946118

<SOS> `` we are friends ; are we not ? '' <EOS>	82.85714297089044
<SOS> she asked . <EOS>	75.41655849778138
<SOS> `` oh , madame , i do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times i am your most respectful servant . '' <EOS>	92.57923513033361
<SOS> the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes . <EOS>	84.02993703845281
<SOS> `` do not my mother and you agree ? '' <EOS>	76.8710920462986
<SOS> asked albert , astonished . <EOS>	72.50284244629155
<SOS> `` on the contrary , '' replied the count , `` did you not hear her declare that we were friends ? '' <EOS>	83.40991961719914
<SOS> they re entered the drawing room , which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted . <EOS>	73.00590677939778
<SOS> it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time . <EOS>	96.09189722303667
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	59.17813489869482
<SOS> madame de saint méran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m. de villefort . <EOS>	72.86466362260413
<SOS> after the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . <EOS>	88.40734664373511
<SOS> but this time the papers were a mere matter of form . <EOS>	62.04659494653227
<SOS> villefort had secluded himself , not to study , but to reflect ; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business , he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events , the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections . <EOS>	55.56418780180752
<SOS> then , instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him , he opened the drawer of his desk , touched a spring , and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda , amongst which he had carefully arranged , in characters only known to himself , the names of all those who , either in his political career , in money matters , at the bar , or in his mysterious love affairs , had become his enemies . <EOS>	84.49305629963214
<SOS> their number was formidable , now that he had begun to fear , and yet these names , powerful though they were , had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences , the almost impassable paths , and the fearful chasms , through which he has so perilously climbed . <EOS>	96.98984593925252
<SOS> when he had run over all these names in his memory , again read and studied them , commenting meanwhile upon his lists , he shook his head . <EOS>	74.2667139734122
<SOS> `` no , '' he murmured , `` none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time , that they might now come and crush me with this secret . <EOS>	92.02152053120211
<SOS> sometimes , as hamlet says : 'foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men 's eyes ; ' but , like a phosphoric light , they rise but to mislead . <EOS>	118.12717485311912
<SOS> the story has been told by the corsican to some priest , who in his turn has repeated it . <EOS>	68.20665819248204
<SOS> m. de monte cristo may have heard it , and to enlighten himself `` but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject ? '' <EOS>	99.19456134769005
<SOS> asked villefort , after a moment 's reflection , `` what interest can this m. de monte cristo or m. zaccone , son of a shipowner of malta , discoverer of a mine in thessaly , now visiting paris for the first time , what interest , i say , can he take in discovering a gloomy , mysterious , and useless fact like this ? <EOS>	72.34450630111243
<SOS> however , among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore , by that friend and that enemy , one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period , in no case , in no circumstance , could there have been any contact between him and me . '' <EOS>	83.95732452424872
<SOS> but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe . <EOS>	98.04768802956667
<SOS> he dreaded not so much the revelation , for he could reply to or deny its truth ; he cared little for that mene , mene , tekel upharsin , which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall ; but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them . <EOS>	96.89688191285056
<SOS> while he was endeavoring to calm his fears , and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams , was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home , in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept , the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard , then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs , followed by tears and lamentations , such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master 's grief . <EOS>	82.75857913179019
<SOS> he drew back the bolt of his door , and almost directly an old lady entered , unannounced , carrying her shawl on her arm , and her bonnet in her hand . <EOS>	95.71140024006503
<SOS> the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead , and her eyes , already sunken by the furrows of age , now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief . <EOS>	114.37274222112468
<SOS> `` oh , sir , '' she said ; `` oh , sir , what a misfortune ! <EOS>	85.50965822517304
<SOS> i shall die of it ; oh , yes , i shall certainly die of it ! '' <EOS>	77.21806221673873
<SOS> and then , falling upon the chair nearest the door , she burst into a paroxysm of sobs . <EOS>	98.4991026645917
<SOS> the servants , standing in the doorway , not daring to approach nearer , were looking at noirtier 's old servant , who had heard the noise from his master 's room , and run there also , remaining behind the others . <EOS>	107.60355334003707
<SOS> villefort rose , and ran towards his mother in law , for it was she . <EOS>	121.31432793245975
<SOS> `` why , what can have happened ? '' <EOS>	85.52916222356065
<SOS> he exclaimed , `` what has thus disturbed you ? <EOS>	87.00799574928611
<SOS> is m. de saint méran with you ? '' <EOS>	94.10067819028633
<SOS> `` m. de saint méran is dead , '' answered the old marchioness , without preface and without expression ; she appeared to be stupefied . <EOS>	78.34163586151375
<SOS> villefort drew back , and clasping his hands together , exclaimed : `` dead ! <EOS>	118.31029164612335
<SOS> so suddenly ? '' <EOS>	114.06934797604526
<SOS> `` a week ago , '' continued madame de saint méran , `` we went out together in the carriage after dinner . <EOS>	75.90304769992088
<SOS> m. de saint méran had been unwell for some days ; still , the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage , and notwithstanding his illness he would leave . <EOS>	88.79357279707015
<SOS> at six leagues from marseilles , after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take , he fell into such a deep sleep , that it appeared to me unnatural ; still i hesitated to wake him , although i fancied that his face was flushed , and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual . <EOS>	64.5133298994787
<SOS> however , as it became dark , and i could no longer see , i fell asleep ; i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek , as from a person suffering in his dreams , and he suddenly threw his head back violently . <EOS>	96.0952771191806
<SOS> i called the valet , i stopped the postilion , i spoke to m. de saint méran , i applied my smelling salts ; but all was over , and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse . '' <EOS>	84.30855109333187
<SOS> villefort stood with his mouth half open , quite stupefied . <EOS>	79.99260581147807
<SOS> `` of course you sent for a doctor ? '' <EOS>	74.73929131779961
<SOS> `` immediately ; but , as i have told you , it was too late . '' <EOS>	64.27952899374557
<SOS> `` yes ; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died . '' <EOS>	96.96341615728892
<SOS> `` oh , yes , sir , he told me ; it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke . '' <EOS>	88.15792951155294
<SOS> `` and what did you do then ? '' <EOS>	66.65036223295346
<SOS> `` m. de saint méran had always expressed a desire , in case his death happened during his absence from paris , that his body might be brought to the family vault . <EOS>	106.46377466432853
<SOS> i had him put into a leaden coffin , and i am preceding him by a few days . '' <EOS>	102.78036497175943
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	98.6292447695749
<SOS> my poor mother ! '' <EOS>	112.20754479298397
<SOS> said villefort , `` to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow ! '' <EOS>	76.30974860544856
<SOS> `` god has supported me through all ; and then , my dear marquis , he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him . <EOS>	91.30596083966807
<SOS> it is true that since i left him , i seem to have lost my senses . <EOS>	91.73973197838714
<SOS> i can not cry ; at my age they say that we have no more tears , still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping . <EOS>	67.91378834412538
<SOS> where is valentine , sir ? <EOS>	84.47526579925388
<SOS> it is on her account i am here ; i wish to see valentine . '' <EOS>	77.90516005111692
<SOS> < num > m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball ; so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother , and that she should be fetched . <EOS>	73.14385385249844
<SOS> `` this instant , sir this instant , i beseech you ! '' <EOS>	80.0496099570475
<SOS> said the old lady . <EOS>	61.27059407933756
<SOS> villefort placed the arm of madame de saint méran within his own , and conducted her to his apartment . <EOS>	80.55394994613201
<SOS> `` rest yourself , mother , '' he said . <EOS>	83.68063919031731
<SOS> the marchioness raised her head at this word , and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child , who still lived for her in valentine , she felt touched at the name of mother , and bursting into tears , she fell on her knees before an armchair , where she buried her venerable head . <EOS>	85.01524365998995
<SOS> villefort left her to the care of the women , while old barrois ran , half scared , to his master ; for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person . <EOS>	104.93069382449951
<SOS> then , while madame de saint méran remained on her knees , praying fervently , villefort sent for a cab , and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf 's . <EOS>	84.34446672330047
<SOS> he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room , that valentine ran to him , saying : `` oh , father , some misfortune has happened ! '' <EOS>	94.35865139232412
<SOS> `` your grandmamma has just arrived , valentine , '' said m. de villefort . <EOS>	88.81089883836657
<SOS> `` and grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	70.33094270526614
<SOS> inquired the young girl , trembling with apprehension . <EOS>	82.92766610100135
<SOS> m. de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter . <EOS>	95.52430526200081
<SOS> it was just in time , for valentine 's head swam , and she staggered ; madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance , and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage , saying : `` what a singular event ! <EOS>	115.4189378744227
<SOS> who could have thought it ? <EOS>	90.30971653852828
<SOS> ah , yes , it is indeed strange ! '' <EOS>	90.75912781650335
<SOS> and the wretched family departed , leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening . <EOS>	80.92680109542279
<SOS> at the foot of the stairs , valentine found barrois awaiting her . <EOS>	93.89623123153075
<SOS> `` m. noirtier wishes to see you tonight , he said , in an undertone . <EOS>	64.61325892279262
<SOS> `` tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma , '' she replied , feeling , with true delicacy , that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran . <EOS>	74.4262617264468
<SOS> valentine found her grandmother in bed ; silent caresses , heartwrung sobs , broken sighs , burning tears , were all that passed in this sad interview , while madame de villefort , leaning on her husband 's arm , maintained all outward forms of respect , at least towards the poor widow . <EOS>	83.25122530107706
<SOS> she soon whispered to her husband : `` i think it would be better for me to retire , with your permission , for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law . '' <EOS>	69.366131474103
<SOS> madame de saint méran heard her . <EOS>	86.78883409659086
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' she said softly to valentine , `` let her leave ; but do you stay . '' <EOS>	83.00710285941278
<SOS> madame de villefort left , and valentine remained alone beside the bed , for the procureur , overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death , had followed his wife . <EOS>	89.41401195584265
<SOS> meanwhile , barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier , who having heard the noise in the house , had , as we have said , sent his old servant to inquire the cause ; on his return , his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger . <EOS>	77.82647170377798
<SOS> `` alas , sir , '' exclaimed barrois , `` a great misfortune has happened . <EOS>	87.93625043896523
<SOS> madame de saint méran has arrived , and her husband is dead ! '' <EOS>	64.39819334366689
<SOS> m. de saint méran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship ; still , the death of one old man always considerably affects another . <EOS>	85.54789205688043
<SOS> noirtier let his head fall upon his chest , apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful ; then he closed one eye , in token of inquiry . <EOS>	63.44012774864275
<SOS> barrois asked , `` mademoiselle valentine ? '' <EOS>	76.1848065455121
<SOS> noirtier nodded his head . <EOS>	101.3168813072174
<SOS> `` she is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say good bye to you in full dress . '' <EOS>	66.85687909925353
<SOS> noirtier again closed his left eye . <EOS>	89.17456752349459
<SOS> `` do you wish to see her ? '' <EOS>	111.09201339952929
<SOS> noirtier again made an affirmative sign . <EOS>	97.52733705998416
<SOS> `` well , they have gone to fetch her , no doubt , from madame de morcerf 's ; i will await her return , and beg her to come up here . <EOS>	91.00013831832366
<SOS> is that what you wish for ? '' <EOS>	98.99133852932721
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the invalid . <EOS>	68.83163184516744
<SOS> barrois , therefore , as we have seen , watched for valentine , and informed her of her grandfather 's wish . <EOS>	76.23737323429093
<SOS> consequently , valentine came up to noirtier , on leaving madame de saint méran , who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep . <EOS>	83.13924891520765
<SOS> within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade , her usual beverage , and a glass . <EOS>	121.14240720125834
<SOS> then , as we have said , the young girl left the bedside to see m. noirtier . <EOS>	84.01661052567353
<SOS> valentine kissed the old man , who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears , whose sources he thought must be exhausted . <EOS>	69.56754460807431
<SOS> the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression . <EOS>	67.59007094602019
<SOS> `` yes , yes , '' said valentine , `` you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left , do you not . '' <EOS>	85.37871259959013
<SOS> the old man intimated that such was his meaning . <EOS>	81.87604796384247
<SOS> `` ah , yes , happily i have , '' replied valentine . <EOS>	83.79339689325765
<SOS> `` without that , what would become of me ? '' <EOS>	56.93005189684579
<SOS> it was one o'clock in the morning . <EOS>	86.20415111663115
<SOS> barrois , who wished to go to bed himself , observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest . <EOS>	89.83633948847256
<SOS> noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child , but wished her good night , for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill . <EOS>	84.81677462985625
<SOS> the next morning she found her grandmother in bed ; the fever had not abated , on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability . <EOS>	76.31361694778548
<SOS> `` oh , dear grandmamma , are you worse ? '' <EOS>	68.0911518341752
<SOS> exclaimed valentine , perceiving all these signs of agitation . <EOS>	80.247071435146
<SOS> `` no , my child , no , '' said madame de saint méran ; `` but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival , that i might send for your father . '' <EOS>	63.94707899297117
<SOS> `` my father ? '' <EOS>	65.13835106323354
<SOS> inquired valentine , uneasily . <EOS>	89.78981550499273
<SOS> `` yes , i wish to speak to him . '' <EOS>	68.17599074208573
<SOS> valentine durst not oppose her grandmother 's wish , the cause of which she did not know , and an instant afterwards villefort entered . <EOS>	76.14158504115532
<SOS> `` sir , '' said madame de saint méran , without using any circumlocution , and as if fearing she had no time to lose , `` you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child ? '' <EOS>	98.51634848415007
<SOS> `` yes , madame , '' replied villefort , `` it is not only projected but arranged . '' <EOS>	91.4344582310677
<SOS> `` your intended son in law is named m. franz d'épinay ? '' <EOS>	66.65745919046488
<SOS> `` yes , madame . '' <EOS>	121.61878892892528
<SOS> `` is he not the son of general d'épinay who was on our side , and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba ? '' <EOS>	84.35223878691234
<SOS> `` the same . '' <EOS>	108.21025389577181
<SOS> `` does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin ? '' <EOS>	80.26483073617314
<SOS> `` our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished , mother , '' said villefort ; `` m. d'épinay was quite a child when his father died , he knows very little of m. noirtier , and will meet him , if not with pleasure , at least with indifference . '' <EOS>	63.37438862147198
<SOS> `` is it a suitable match ? '' <EOS>	95.14448075268261
<SOS> `` in every respect . '' <EOS>	82.36364222618305
<SOS> `` and the young man ? '' <EOS>	101.5349275269755
<SOS> `` is regarded with universal esteem . '' <EOS>	70.52619559405302
<SOS> `` you approve of him ? '' <EOS>	76.15852146300837
<SOS> `` he is one of the most well bred young men i know . '' <EOS>	94.82746062769527
<SOS> during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent . <EOS>	90.37339496989108
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said madame de saint méran , after a few minutes ' reflection , `` i must hasten the marriage , for i have but a short time to live . '' <EOS>	99.6751383964218
<SOS> `` you , madame ? '' <EOS>	83.49383751597698
<SOS> `` you , dear mamma ? '' <EOS>	71.19961214716422
<SOS> exclaimed m. de villefort and valentine at the same time . <EOS>	105.17500150221836
<SOS> `` i know what i am saying , '' continued the marchioness ; `` i must hurry you , so that , as she has no mother , she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage . <EOS>	89.36097661843615
<SOS> i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renée , whom you have so soon forgotten , sir . '' <EOS>	93.74951811146434
<SOS> `` ah , madame , '' said villefort , `` you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child . '' <EOS>	58.89900853275472
<SOS> `` a stepmother is never a mother , sir . <EOS>	94.25770587022089
<SOS> but this is not to the purpose , our business concerns valentine , let us leave the dead in peace . '' <EOS>	80.41375753892409
<SOS> all this was said with such exceeding rapidity , that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium . <EOS>	76.70824929109573
<SOS> `` it shall be as you wish , madame , '' said villefort ; `` more especially since your wishes coincide with mine , and as soon as m. d'épinay arrives in paris `` < num > m `` my dear grandmother , '' interrupted valentine , `` consider decorum the recent death . <EOS>	109.66657659917836
<SOS> you would not have me marry under such sad auspices ? '' <EOS>	86.73363885053702
<SOS> `` my child , '' exclaimed the old lady sharply , `` let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future . <EOS>	90.11248485666107
<SOS> i also was married at the death bed of my mother , and certainly i have not been less happy on that account . '' <EOS>	78.48534109103251
<SOS> `` still that idea of death , madame , '' said villefort . <EOS>	76.89135479913017
<SOS> `` still ? <EOS>	95.95375706771094
<SOS> always ! <EOS>	63.94676517679654
<SOS> i tell you i am going to die do you understand ? <EOS>	71.4549285980142
<SOS> well , before dying , i wish to see my son in law . <EOS>	75.81992402580647
<SOS> i wish to tell him to make my child happy ; i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me ; in fact , i will know him i will ! '' <EOS>	87.2112971189984
<SOS> continued the old lady , with a fearful expression , `` that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him , if he should not fulfil his duty ! '' <EOS>	77.14685959615953
<SOS> `` madame , '' said villefort , `` you must lay aside these exalted ideas , which almost assume the appearance of madness . <EOS>	86.10789059767758
<SOS> the dead , once buried in their graves , rise no more . '' <EOS>	97.97582105200122

<SOS> valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread , for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre . <EOS>	109.48618967026717
<SOS> the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught , and then turned on her pillow , repeating , `` the notary , the notary ! '' <EOS>	111.63677596178361
<SOS> m. de villefort left the room , and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother . <EOS>	81.8055133227804
<SOS> the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative . <EOS>	88.17177162735298
<SOS> a bright spot burned in either cheek , her respiration was short and difficult , and her pulse beat with feverish excitement . <EOS>	79.48561407844872
<SOS> she was thinking of the despair of maximilian , when he should be informed that madame de saint méran , instead of being an ally , was unconsciously acting as his enemy . <EOS>	109.47278357078994
<SOS> more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother , and she would not have hesitated a moment , if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud ; but morrel was of plebeian extraction , and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble . <EOS>	97.5375552514887
<SOS> her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it , by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so ; for , were it once discovered by her father and mother , all would be lost . <EOS>	74.25495761237133
<SOS> two hours passed thus ; madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep , and the notary had arrived . <EOS>	58.4372939764747
<SOS> though his coming was announced in a very low tone , madame de saint méran arose from her pillow . <EOS>	77.61532004521932
<SOS> `` the notary ! '' <EOS>	63.61935671812262

<SOS> `` but , grandmamma `` `` leave me go ! '' <EOS>	93.70614389770725
<SOS> the young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining room . <EOS>	76.63192345572999
<SOS> valentine instantly ran down . <EOS>	89.1206076879731
<SOS> the doctor was a friend of the family , and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day , and very fond of valentine , whose birth he had witnessed . <EOS>	101.37296547873545
<SOS> he had himself a daughter about her age , but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive . <EOS>	75.9938264132193
<SOS> `` oh , '' said valentine , `` we have been waiting for you with such impatience , dear m. d'avrigny . <EOS>	103.62372105228155

<SOS> valentine colored . <EOS>	71.09487257296622
<SOS> m. d'avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent , for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind . <EOS>	75.73716119256044
<SOS> < num > m `` no , '' she replied , `` it is for my poor grandmother . <EOS>	75.22733598552576

<SOS> repeated the doctor . <EOS>	67.63463347078824
<SOS> `` yes , and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband , whom she never left , has called her , and that she must go and join him . <EOS>	83.23610735013176

<SOS> `` who does not love you ? '' <EOS>	58.9843702161377
<SOS> valentine smiled sadly . <EOS>	71.72682365821814
<SOS> `` what are your grandmother 's symptoms ? '' <EOS>	74.08934458517349
<SOS> `` an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep ; she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body , which she at the same time watched . <EOS>	76.57413163034403
<SOS> it must have been delirium ; she fancies , too , that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass . '' <EOS>	76.02659820799653
<SOS> `` it is singular , '' said the doctor ; `` i was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such hallucinations . '' <EOS>	86.98769382801142
<SOS> `` it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition , '' said valentine ; `` and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad ; and my father , who you know is a strong minded man , himself appeared deeply impressed . '' <EOS>	77.29145633655911
<SOS> `` we will go and see , '' said the doctor ; `` what you tell me seems very strange . '' <EOS>	81.91101577612899
<SOS> the notary here descended , and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone . <EOS>	64.7134962776547
<SOS> `` go upstairs , '' she said to the doctor . <EOS>	105.658237869411

<SOS> i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself . '' <EOS>	81.5066503947769
<SOS> the doctor pressed valentine 's hand , and while he visited her grandmother , she descended the steps . <EOS>	57.8465330340978
<SOS> we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk . <EOS>	89.41886628815064
<SOS> after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house , and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair , she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench ; then from the bench she went to the gate . <EOS>	79.42330620474503
<SOS> as usual , valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers , but without gathering them . <EOS>	86.74006166971321
<SOS> the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament , though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe . <EOS>	75.43748739475474
<SOS> < num > m she then turned towards the avenue . <EOS>	92.33268948343475
<SOS> as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name . <EOS>	106.24201186444834

<SOS> with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint méran and the death of the marquis , that something would occur at m. de villefort 's in connection with his attachment for valentine . <EOS>	80.73403960576903
<SOS> his presentiments were realized , as we shall see , and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees . <EOS>	109.56559559469883
<SOS> valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety , and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her , she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy . <EOS>	72.42628642848808
<SOS> morrel called her , and she ran to the gate . <EOS>	86.12247569521834
<SOS> `` you here at this hour ? '' <EOS>	69.13952185552802
<SOS> said she . <EOS>	71.20990990618557
<SOS> `` yes , my poor girl , '' replied morrel ; `` i come to bring and to hear bad tidings . '' <EOS>	84.70694467807546
<SOS> `` this is , indeed , a house of mourning , '' said valentine ; `` speak , maximilian , although the cup of sorrow seems already full . '' <EOS>	87.16193678257446

<SOS> this morning the subject was introduced , and my dear grandmother , on whom i depended as my only support , not only declared herself favorable to it , but is so anxious for it , that they only await the arrival of m. d'épinay , and the following day the contract will be signed .

<SOS> a deep sigh escaped the young man , who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved . <EOS>	80.54833821000378
<SOS> `` alas , '' replied he , `` it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips . <EOS>	76.36509051824133

<SOS> valentine uttered a cry . <EOS>	91.39536420212265
<SOS> `` i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since , '' said morrel ; `` we were speaking , he of the sorrow your family had experienced , and i of your grief , when a carriage rolled into the courtyard . <EOS>	96.58597318048932
<SOS> never , till then , had i placed any confidence in presentiments , but now i can not help believing them , valentine . <EOS>	109.77241676652969
<SOS> at the sound of that carriage i shuddered ; soon i heard steps on the staircase , which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan . <EOS>	79.23458855544396
<SOS> the door at last opened ; albert de morcerf entered first , and i began to hope my fears were vain , when , after him , another young man advanced , and the count exclaimed : 'ah , here is the baron franz d'épinay ! ' <EOS>	89.8908584462342
<SOS> i summoned all my strength and courage to my support . <EOS>	90.46093124404706

<SOS> it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m. franz d'épinay , not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract , but your own will ? '' <EOS>	78.72772355973848
<SOS> `` again you drive me to despair , maximilian , '' said valentine , `` again you plunge the dagger into the wound ! <EOS>	81.8482765830195
<SOS> what would you do , tell me , if your sister listened to such a proposition ? '' <EOS>	71.55648719647331
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , '' replied morrel with a bitter smile , `` i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation , but of what i intend doing myself . <EOS>	74.70602284187878

<SOS> from the day i first saw you , all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection . <EOS>	89.61892346318294
<SOS> one day you acknowledged that you loved me , and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you , for to gain you would be life to me . <EOS>	71.9354704148528
<SOS> now , i think no more ; i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven , and now i have lost it . <EOS>	91.18989836647374
<SOS> it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not . '' <EOS>	57.81289636682374
<SOS> morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness ; valentine looked at him a moment with her large , scrutinizing eyes , endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart . <EOS>	73.49484600959309
<SOS> `` but , in a word , what are you going to do ? '' <EOS>	72.28031334040526

<SOS> said morrel , bowing . <EOS>	92.84458540064468
<SOS> `` where are you going ? '' <EOS>	85.96242248010802
<SOS> cried the young girl , extending her hand through the opening , and seizing maximilian by his coat , for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover 's calmness could not be real ; `` where are you going ? '' <EOS>	76.71068117056366
<SOS> `` i am going , that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family : and to set an example which every honest and devoted man , situated as i am , may follow . '' <EOS>	84.13497632748124

<SOS> cried the young girl . <EOS>	71.16032958394591
<SOS> `` then adieu , valentine ! '' <EOS>	102.85074961959462
<SOS> valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed , as morrel was going away , and passing both her hands through the opening , she clasped and wrung them . <EOS>	86.19866415451294
<SOS> `` i must know what you mean to do ! '' <EOS>	59.28511604489594

<SOS> `` where are you going ? '' <EOS>	90.15663969585286
<SOS> `` oh , fear not , '' said maximilian , stopping at a short distance , `` i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me . <EOS>	117.52363789124725
<SOS> another might threaten to seek m. franz , to provoke him , and to fight with him ; all that would be folly . <EOS>	73.3212828298699

<SOS> he drew near with his sweet smile , and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood . <EOS>	108.07409286695338
<SOS> `` listen , my dear , my adored valentine , '' said he in his melodious and grave tone ; `` those who , like us , have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world , such may read each other 's hearts . <EOS>	71.19576926716476

<SOS> this is what i shall do ; i will wait until the very moment you are married , for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us , since m. franz may , after all , die before that time , a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it , nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die , and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned . <EOS>	84.72642270374209

<SOS> < num > m valentine trembled convulsively ; she loosened her hold of the gate , her arms fell by her side , and two large tears rolled down her cheeks . <EOS>	85.8938763337672
<SOS> the young man stood before her , sorrowful and resolute . <EOS>	74.00590365550504
<SOS> `` oh , for pity 's sake , '' said she , `` you will live , will you not ? '' <EOS>	120.54977183742605

<SOS> now listen to me , maximilian ; if by artifice , by entreaty , by accident in short , if by any means i can delay this marriage , will you wait ? '' <EOS>	66.65599617755181

<SOS> `` we will wait , then , '' said morrel . <EOS>	78.13485221670184
<SOS> `` yes , we will wait , '' replied valentine , who revived at these words ; `` there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are . '' <EOS>	101.76638039597064
<SOS> `` i rely on you , valentine , '' said morrel ; `` all you do will be well done ; only if they disregard your prayers , if your father and madame de saint méran insist that m. d'épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract `` `` then you have my promise , maximilian .

<SOS> `` from the notary , m . <EOS>	108.04278833755266

<SOS> `` yes , '' said valentine , `` i will now acknowledge you are right , maximilian ; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal ? '' <EOS>	67.0188887452477

<SOS> `` my adored valentine , words can not express one half of my satisfaction . '' <EOS>	98.7159763669755
<SOS> valentine had approached , or rather , had placed her lips so near the fence , that they nearly touched those of morrel , which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier . <EOS>	104.93372237421782
<SOS> `` adieu , then , till we meet again , '' said valentine , tearing herself away . <EOS>	73.41222088927803
<SOS> `` i shall hear from you ? '' <EOS>	67.67934075784731
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	122.12829267310256
<SOS> `` thanks , thanks , dear love , adieu ! '' <EOS>	71.58565538744799
<SOS> the sound of a kiss was heard , and valentine fled through the avenue . <EOS>	101.08816268732714
<SOS> morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches , and of her footstep on the gravel , then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved , and then also disappeared . <EOS>	97.22398721808511
<SOS> the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message . <EOS>	86.7477042887208
<SOS> it was only on the following day , at about ten o'clock in the morning , as he was starting to call on m. deschamps , the notary , that he received from the postman a small billet , which he knew to be from valentine , although he had not before seen her writing . <EOS>	91.60173321882542
<SOS> it was to this effect : `` tears , entreaties , prayers , have availed me nothing . <EOS>	85.41568622182609
<SOS> yesterday , for two hours , i was at the church of saint philippe du roule , and for two hours i prayed most fervently . <EOS>	91.67728302933284
<SOS> heaven is as inflexible as man , and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o'clock . <EOS>	100.23813551965962
<SOS> i have but one promise and but one heart to give ; that promise is pledged to you , that heart is also yours . <EOS>	96.94193847488106

<SOS> you will be very kind to me , will you not , morrel , to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus ? <EOS>	79.41982881397813
<SOS> i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier , that the contract is to be signed this evening . '' <EOS>	95.57017854963124
<SOS> morrel went also to the notary , who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening . <EOS>	98.25641825292091
<SOS> then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more . <EOS>	80.6283730643788
<SOS> franz had been to announce the ceremony , and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him ; the death of m. de saint méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness . <EOS>	113.77650992680128
<SOS> the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran , who had left her bed to receive him , but had been obliged to return to it immediately after . <EOS>	93.85744137176304
<SOS> it is easy to suppose that morrel 's agitation would not escape the count 's penetrating eye . <EOS>	81.92391965741817
<SOS> monte cristo was more affectionate than ever , indeed , his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all . <EOS>	83.17501675995629
<SOS> but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine , and kept his secret . <EOS>	89.45651015068663
<SOS> the young man read valentine 's letter twenty times in the course of the day . <EOS>	57.200060816057174
<SOS> it was her first , and on what an occasion ! <EOS>	56.1943044552944
<SOS> each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy . <EOS>	57.00554169131224
<SOS> how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution ! <EOS>	100.78736879691418
<SOS> what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything ! <EOS>	115.66609079929864
<SOS> how ought she really to be supremely loved ! <EOS>	116.44791935415077
<SOS> she becomes at once a queen and a wife , and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently . <EOS>	68.57024884389209
<SOS> morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say , `` here i am , maximilian ; come and help me . '' <EOS>	88.340874232635
<SOS> he had arranged everything for her escape ; two ladders were hidden in the clover field ; a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone , without a servant , without lights ; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps , as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions . <EOS>	92.01489963733894
<SOS> occasionally he shuddered ; he thought of the moment when , from the top of that wall , he should protect the descent of his dear valentine , pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand . <EOS>	80.82443700366294
<SOS> when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near , he wished for solitude , his agitation was extreme ; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him . <EOS>	83.88997068772144
<SOS> he shut himself in his room , and tried to read , but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word , and he threw away the book , and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan , the ladders and the fence . <EOS>	56.15046525255577
<SOS> at length the hour drew near . <EOS>	88.33737608591845
<SOS> never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully . <EOS>	102.9790000570734
<SOS> morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six . <EOS>	115.0197339067562
<SOS> he then said , `` it is time to start ; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o'clock , but perhaps valentine will not wait for that . '' <EOS>	88.23670308603008
<SOS> consequently , morrel , having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece , entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight . <EOS>	73.72779066597944
<SOS> the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin , where morrel had often waited . <EOS>	95.4316747562372
<SOS> the night gradually drew on , and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue . <EOS>	69.69302028728838
<SOS> then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart , and looked through the small opening in the gate ; there was yet no one to be seen . <EOS>	86.47074277288802
<SOS> the clock struck half past eight , and still another half hour was passed in waiting , while morrel walked to and fro , and gazed more and more frequently through the opening . <EOS>	93.98259604543978
<SOS> the garden became darker still , but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress , and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps . <EOS>	86.8973216058199
<SOS> the house , which was discernible through the trees , remained in darkness , and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on . <EOS>	106.02212268846938
<SOS> morrel looked at his watch , which wanted a quarter to ten ; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine . <EOS>	59.95132650501462
<SOS> this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed . <EOS>	118.40185400635335
<SOS> it was a terrible moment for the young man . <EOS>	85.98388931667247
<SOS> the slightest rustling of the foliage , the least whistling of the wind , attracted his attention , and drew the perspiration to his brow ; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder , and , not to lose a moment , placed his foot on the first step . <EOS>	83.51404145439156
<SOS> amidst all these alternations of hope and fear , the clock struck ten . <EOS>	86.47633423660093
<SOS> `` it is impossible , '' said maximilian , `` that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions . <EOS>	105.69032633685718
<SOS> i have weighed all the chances , calculated the time required for all the forms ; something must have happened . '' <EOS>	83.30464599922738
<SOS> and then he walked rapidly to and fro , and pressed his burning forehead against the fence . <EOS>	61.87784477970625
<SOS> had valentine fainted ? <EOS>	56.65038961524011
<SOS> or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight ? <EOS>	73.76566997084122
<SOS> these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man . <EOS>	87.84428698903602
<SOS> the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape , and that she had fainted in one of the paths , was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind . <EOS>	61.58737324285251
<SOS> `` in that case , '' said he , `` i should lose her , and by my own fault . '' <EOS>	60.11444295801697
<SOS> he dwelt on this idea for a moment , then it appeared reality . <EOS>	76.18885163146568
<SOS> he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance ; he ventured to call , and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh . <EOS>	67.29019175244504
<SOS> at last the half hour struck . <EOS>	66.75816268906671
<SOS> it was impossible to wait longer , his temples throbbed violently , his eyes were growing dim ; he passed one leg over the wall , and in a moment leaped down on the other side . <EOS>	71.3413444352224
<SOS> he was on villefort 's premises had arrived there by scaling the wall . <EOS>	74.32014849503597
<SOS> what might be the consequences ? <EOS>	108.40733546072494
<SOS> however , he had not ventured thus far to draw back . <EOS>	83.53347521494429
<SOS> he followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees . <EOS>	107.68346704896638
<SOS> in a moment he had passed through them , and could see the house distinctly . <EOS>	83.82574989810891
<SOS> < num > m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated . <EOS>	61.50025217923713
<SOS> instead of lights at every window , as is customary on days of ceremony , he saw only a gray mass , which was veiled also by a cloud , which at that moment obscured the moon 's feeble light . <EOS>	89.30384990099392
<SOS> a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor . <EOS>	107.60403983898813
<SOS> these three windows were in madame de saint méran 's room . <EOS>	57.171570479128775
<SOS> another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort 's bedroom . <EOS>	105.12557899705833
<SOS> morrel guessed all this . <EOS>	84.02032459764044
<SOS> so many times , in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day , had he made her describe the whole house , that without having seen it he knew it all . <EOS>	66.63773644503411
<SOS> this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine 's absence had done . <EOS>	62.94792377051203
<SOS> almost mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more , and be certain of the misfortune he feared , morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees , and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden , when the sound of a voice , still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him . <EOS>	94.37703130555295
<SOS> at this sound , as he was already partially exposed to view , he stepped back and concealed himself completely , remaining perfectly motionless . <EOS>	74.97259728052325
<SOS> he had formed his resolution . <EOS>	81.16853071934175
<SOS> if it was valentine alone , he would speak as she passed ; if she was accompanied , and he could not speak , still he should see her , and know that she was safe ; if they were strangers , he would listen to their conversation , and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery . <EOS>	94.20348405412064
<SOS> the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it , and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps , followed by a gentleman in black . <EOS>	78.71610795473094
<SOS> they descended , and advanced towards the clump of trees , and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor d'avrigny . <EOS>	98.86232105567302
<SOS> < num > m the young man , seeing them approach , drew back mechanically , until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump ; there he was compelled to remain . <EOS>	107.29798700786198
<SOS> soon the two gentlemen stopped also . <EOS>	116.82663824808189
<SOS> `` ah , my dear doctor , '' said the procureur , `` heaven declares itself against my house ! <EOS>	80.98746138837474
<SOS> what a dreadful death what a blow ! <EOS>	88.48424479247659
<SOS> seek not to console me ; alas , nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh ! <EOS>	84.50895676993704
<SOS> dead , dead ! '' <EOS>	120.2819288882288
<SOS> the cold sweat sprang to the young man 's brow , and his teeth chattered . <EOS>	61.164752284307994
<SOS> who could be dead in that house , which villefort himself had called accursed ? <EOS>	83.6010321087033
<SOS> `` my dear m. de villefort , '' replied the doctor , with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man , `` i have not led you here to console you ; on the contrary `` `` what can you mean ? '' <EOS>	91.97666573875853
<SOS> asked the procureur , alarmed . <EOS>	70.36213661357277
<SOS> `` i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you , there is another , perhaps , still greater . '' <EOS>	89.88047942184656
<SOS> `` can it be possible ? '' <EOS>	86.24347674569182
<SOS> murmured villefort , clasping his hands . <EOS>	74.49917277726124
<SOS> `` what are you going to tell me ? '' <EOS>	106.42880764675641
<SOS> `` are we quite alone , my friend ? '' <EOS>	94.34042098847816
<SOS> `` yes , quite ; but why all these precautions ? '' <EOS>	62.40803516420288
<SOS> `` because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you , '' said the doctor . <EOS>	87.08671321249835
<SOS> `` let us sit down . '' <EOS>	102.8415373405633
<SOS> villefort fell , rather than seated himself . <EOS>	91.31917248424512
<SOS> the doctor stood before him , with one hand placed on his shoulder . <EOS>	80.50832793836537
<SOS> morrel , horrified , supported his head with one hand , and with the other pressed his heart , lest its beatings should be heard . <EOS>	96.22644129218531
<SOS> `` dead , dead ! '' <EOS>	83.6478552001778
<SOS> repeated he within himself ; and he felt as if he were also dying . <EOS>	112.35078278339216
<SOS> `` speak , doctor i am listening , '' said villefort ; `` strike i am prepared for everything ! '' <EOS>	92.2563007469232
<SOS> `` madame de saint méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health . '' <EOS>	100.87083481049058
<SOS> morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes . <EOS>	78.75841342747931
<SOS> `` grief has consumed her , '' said villefort `` yes , grief , doctor ! <EOS>	69.93450813660976
<SOS> after living forty years with the marquis `` `` it is not grief , my dear villefort , '' said the doctor ; `` grief may kill , although it rarely does , and never in a day , never in an hour , never in ten minutes . '' <EOS>	90.88341454684664
<SOS> villefort answered nothing , he simply raised his head , which had been cast down before , and looked at the doctor with amazement . <EOS>	60.78558516360044
<SOS> `` were you present during the last struggle ? '' <EOS>	94.34381741005369
<SOS> asked m. d'avrigny . <EOS>	73.29391276418988
<SOS> `` i was , '' replied the procureur ; `` you begged me not to leave . '' <EOS>	95.857789663511
<SOS> `` did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint méran has fallen a victim ? '' <EOS>	66.30768533425277
<SOS> `` i did . <EOS>	62.68676081760352
<SOS> madame de saint méran had three successive attacks , at intervals of some minutes , each one more serious than the former . <EOS>	105.95431607462245
<SOS> when you arrived , madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes ; she then had a fit , which i took to be simply a nervous attack , and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed , and her limbs and neck appear stiffened , that i became really alarmed . <EOS>	88.58248866965869
<SOS> then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought . <EOS>	66.45738587407214
<SOS> this crisis past , i endeavored to catch your eye , but could not . <EOS>	74.14085639291093
<SOS> you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me . <EOS>	65.37056431856254
<SOS> this was more terrible than the first ; the same nervous movements were repeated , and the mouth contracted and turned purple . '' <EOS>	81.75680517571809
<SOS> `` and at the third she expired . '' <EOS>	112.83548878590936
<SOS> `` at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus ; you confirmed my opinion . '' <EOS>	77.57996064075239
<SOS> `` yes , before others , '' replied the doctor ; `` but now we are alone `` `` what are you going to say ? <EOS>	86.10325464696332
<SOS> oh , spare me ! '' <EOS>	76.50275887734655
<SOS> `` that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same . '' <EOS>	88.03620138050759
<SOS> m. de villefort started from his seat , then in a moment fell down again , silent and motionless . <EOS>	64.22835868951788
<SOS> morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake . <EOS>	97.91118013017109
<SOS> `` listen , '' said the doctor ; `` i know the full importance of the statement i have just made , and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it . '' <EOS>	85.10538701651608
<SOS> `` do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend ? '' <EOS>	95.24497847267978
<SOS> asked villefort . <EOS>	81.79165639796821
<SOS> `` as a friend , and only as a friend , at this moment . <EOS>	101.4681368309981

<SOS> and to that friend i say , 'during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued , i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint méran , and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison , but i could also specify the poison . ' '' <EOS>	77.40622651546269
<SOS> `` can it be possible ? '' <EOS>	105.17659478177194
<SOS> `` the symptoms are marked , do you see ? <EOS>	85.85268291242859
<SOS> sleep broken by nervous spasms , excitation of the brain , torpor of the nerve centres . <EOS>	69.0147318055405
<SOS> madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine , which by some mistake , perhaps , has been given to her . '' <EOS>	72.67116598143295
<SOS> villefort seized the doctor 's hand . <EOS>	81.42876703133014
<SOS> `` oh , it is impossible , '' said he , `` i must be dreaming ! <EOS>	82.70946443910884

<SOS> `` have pity on me doctor ! <EOS>	79.02981976011682

<SOS> `` indeed , my dear friend , '' said m. d'avrigny , `` i would not accuse anyone ; i speak only of an accident , you understand , of a mistake , but whether accident or mistake , the fact is there ; it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you . <EOS>	76.4606974650328

<SOS> `` of whom ? <EOS>	80.6041164081841
<SOS> how ? <EOS>	102.54778867597327
<SOS> of what ? '' <EOS>	62.83581407219135
<SOS> `` may not barrois , the old servant , have made a mistake , and have given madame de saint méran a dose prepared for his master ? '' <EOS>	96.74245167772682
<SOS> `` for my father ? '' <EOS>	91.51743438150308
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	84.56953531550263

<SOS> `` nothing is more simple . <EOS>	68.06153437845867
<SOS> you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases , of which paralysis is one . <EOS>	80.01711800833776
<SOS> for instance , having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m. noirtier , i resolved to try one last means , and for three months i have been giving him brucine ; so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains . <EOS>	66.07276528552799
<SOS> this quantity , which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m. noirtier , which has become gradually accustomed to it , would be sufficient to kill another person . '' <EOS>	86.9858983350273
<SOS> `` my dear doctor , there is no communication between m. noirtier 's apartment and that of madame de saint méran , and barrois never entered my mother in law 's room . <EOS>	92.44912730088564

<SOS> `` is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself ? '' <EOS>	61.31745986225309
<SOS> `` why do you ask me that ? <EOS>	78.98442676053061

<SOS> `` and you will find traces of poison ? '' <EOS>	103.8937608061176
<SOS> `` no , i did not say of poison , but we can prove what was the state of the body ; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death , and we shall say , 'dear villefort , if this thing has been caused by negligence , watch over your servants ; if from hatred , watch your enemies . ' '' <EOS>	106.62334789156081
<SOS> `` what do you propose to me , d'avrigny ? '' <EOS>	57.66585448804968
<SOS> said villefort in despair ; `` so soon as another is admitted into our secret , an inquest will become necessary ; and an inquest in my house impossible ! <EOS>	91.44544834355399
<SOS> still , '' continued the procureur , looking at the doctor with uneasiness , `` if you wish it if you demand it , why then it shall be done . <EOS>	80.96292004103522
<SOS> but , doctor , you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal , after so much sorrow ? <EOS>	103.83492170796295
<SOS> my wife and my daughter would die of it ! <EOS>	96.99980466700453
<SOS> and i , doctor you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupy one has not been king 's attorney twenty five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies ; mine are numerous . <EOS>	88.25545087837834
<SOS> let this affair be talked of , it will be a triumph for them , which will make them rejoice , and cover me with shame . <EOS>	103.23106198764862
<SOS> pardon me , doctor , these worldly ideas ; were you a priest i should not dare tell you that , but you are a man , and you know mankind . <EOS>	104.04222527812135
<SOS> doctor , pray recall your words ; you have said nothing , have you ? '' <EOS>	107.95823242256535
<SOS> `` my dear m. de villefort , '' replied the doctor , `` my first duty is to humanity . <EOS>	83.87611947519333
<SOS> i would have saved madame de saint méran , if science could have done it ; but she is dead and my duty regards the living . <EOS>	84.59007198933773
<SOS> let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts ; i am willing , if anyone should suspect this , that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance . <EOS>	77.69474662309541
<SOS> meanwhile , sir , watch always watch carefully , for perhaps the evil may not stop here . <EOS>	71.446957531824
<SOS> and when you have found the culprit , if you find him , i will say to you , 'you are a magistrate , do as you will ! ' '' <EOS>	84.43558291010768
<SOS> `` i thank you , doctor , '' said villefort with indescribable joy ; `` i never had a better friend than you . '' <EOS>	77.52735060682461
<SOS> and , as if he feared doctor d'avrigny would recall his promise , he hurried him towards the house . <EOS>	92.06618474332134
<SOS> when they were gone , morrel ventured out from under the trees , and the moon shone upon his face , which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost . <EOS>	73.90221945735213
<SOS> `` i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful , but most terrible manner , '' said he ; `` but valentine , poor girl , how will she bear so much sorrow ? '' <EOS>	103.2472768283692
<SOS> as he thought thus , he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains . <EOS>	82.4500444152647
<SOS> the light had almost disappeared from the former ; doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp , and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window . <EOS>	77.64993560920742
<SOS> at the extremity of the building , on the contrary , he saw one of the three windows open . <EOS>	77.9360641104229
<SOS> a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without , and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony . <EOS>	65.53010684655344
<SOS> morrel shuddered ; he thought he heard a sob . <EOS>	82.08942679687935
<SOS> it can not be wondered at that his mind , generally so courageous , but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions , love and fear , was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts . <EOS>	108.04976632670135
<SOS> although it was impossible that valentine should see him , hidden as he was , he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him ; his disturbed mind told him so . <EOS>	70.38913160180935
<SOS> this double error became an irresistible reality , and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth , he bounded from his hiding place , and with two strides , at the risk of being seen , at the risk of alarming valentine , at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl , he crossed the flower garden , which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake , and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house , he reached the step , ran quickly up and pushed the door , which opened without offering any resistance . <EOS>	80.3879925603416
<SOS> valentine had not seen him . <EOS>	68.42863476590404
<SOS> her eyes , raised towards heaven , were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure , its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven . <EOS>	81.61234886337235
<SOS> her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother . <EOS>	103.39916383236606
<SOS> meanwhile , morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase , which , being carpeted , prevented his approach being heard , and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m. de villefort even would not have alarmed him . <EOS>	68.53085960563554
<SOS> he was quite prepared for any such encounter . <EOS>	66.09650321230677
<SOS> he would at once approach valentine 's father and acknowledge all , begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts . <EOS>	81.07246164266144
<SOS> morrel was mad . <EOS>	76.19178217832905
<SOS> happily he did not meet anyone . <EOS>	55.130614487203026
<SOS> now , especially , did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him ; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase , and while he was feeling his way , a sob indicated the direction he was to take . <EOS>	76.83872697339304
<SOS> he turned back , a door partly open enabled him to see his road , and to hear the voice of one in sorrow . <EOS>	79.92156181036378
<SOS> he pushed the door open and entered . <EOS>	93.83589906566417
<SOS> at the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard . <EOS>	84.11696126054174
<SOS> by its side , on her knees , and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair , was valentine , trembling and sobbing , her hands extended above her head , clasped and stiff . <EOS>	58.39368810338183
<SOS> she had turned from the window , which remained open , and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling ; her words were rapid , incoherent , unintelligible , for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance . <EOS>	83.05638313196465
<SOS> the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler , and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene . <EOS>	92.77239004495807
<SOS> morrel could not resist this ; he was not exemplary for piety , he was not easily impressed , but valentine suffering , weeping , wringing her hands before him , was more than he could bear in silence . <EOS>	68.39357387922948
<SOS> he sighed , and whispered a name , and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him . <EOS>	75.59534154856502
<SOS> valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise . <EOS>	58.77793347662282
<SOS> a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions . <EOS>	112.96770229019674
<SOS> morrel held out his hand to her . <EOS>	100.69893313343529
<SOS> valentine , as her only apology for not having met him , pointed to the corpse under the sheet , and began to sob again . <EOS>	84.87702922227439
<SOS> neither dared for some time to speak in that room . <EOS>	87.98465640231869
<SOS> they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose ; at length valentine ventured . <EOS>	77.79589042775156
<SOS> `` my friend , '' said she , `` how came you here ? <EOS>	60.26243569762077
<SOS> alas , i would say you are welcome , had not death opened the way for you into this house . '' <EOS>	104.27036219999638
<SOS> `` valentine , '' said morrel with a trembling voice , `` i had waited since half past eight , and did not see you come ; i became uneasy , leaped the wall , found my way through the garden , when voices conversing about the fatal event `` `` what voices ? '' <EOS>	91.10066601860666
<SOS> asked valentine . <EOS>	73.93271296758283
<SOS> morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m. de villefort , and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands , the stiff neck , and the purple lips . <EOS>	102.13668073184633
<SOS> `` your servants , '' said he , `` who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story ; from them i learned it all . '' <EOS>	90.64459463459745
<SOS> `` but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here , love . '' <EOS>	107.52152433397453
<SOS> `` forgive me , '' replied morrel ; `` i will go away . '' <EOS>	106.59830142348393
<SOS> `` no , '' said valentine , `` you might meet someone ; stay . '' <EOS>	81.57063280181272
<SOS> `` but if anyone should come here `` the young girl shook her head . <EOS>	85.63594151182541
<SOS> `` no one will come , '' said she ; `` do not fear , there is our safeguard , '' pointing to the bed . <EOS>	85.33322371375266
<SOS> `` but what has become of m . <EOS>	98.01138807537139
<SOS> d'épinay ? '' <EOS>	63.42046798654137
<SOS> replied morrel . <EOS>	75.13846446952628
<SOS> < num > m `` m. franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying . '' <EOS>	98.15168926898164
<SOS> `` alas , '' said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy ; for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely . <EOS>	113.47956114021918
<SOS> `` but what redoubles my sorrow , '' continued the young girl , as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment , `` is that the poor old lady , on her death bed , requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible ; she also , thinking to protect me , was acting against me . '' <EOS>	83.85351433400844
<SOS> `` hark ! '' <EOS>	110.8087753626342
<SOS> said morrel . <EOS>	78.66894232257006
<SOS> they both listened ; steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs . <EOS>	73.65983561566308
<SOS> `` it is my father , who has just left his study . '' <EOS>	83.78507017322009
<SOS> `` to accompany the doctor to the door , '' added morrel . <EOS>	92.64310681493126
<SOS> `` how do you know it is the doctor ? '' <EOS>	90.57740434902605
<SOS> asked valentine , astonished . <EOS>	83.35236757386728
<SOS> `` i imagined it must be , '' said morrel . <EOS>	76.29793363159511
<SOS> valentine looked at the young man ; they heard the street door close , then m. de villefort locked the garden door , and returned upstairs . <EOS>	93.79946203449455
<SOS> he stopped a moment in the anteroom , as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran 's ; morrel concealed himself behind a door ; valentine remained motionless , grief seeming to deprive her of all fear . <EOS>	75.43606772435749
<SOS> m. de villefort passed on to his own room . <EOS>	68.34224637640912
<SOS> `` now , '' said valentine , `` you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden . '' <EOS>	94.89071818594572
<SOS> morrel looked at her with astonishment . <EOS>	120.7196887625698
<SOS> `` there is but one way left you that is safe , '' said she ; `` it is through my grandfather 's room . '' <EOS>	87.45086662863574
<SOS> she rose . <EOS>	74.0720768858363
<SOS> `` come , '' she added . <EOS>	94.75635253581632
<SOS> `` where ? '' <EOS>	94.08663185891156
<SOS> asked maximilian . <EOS>	89.85927407313316
<SOS> `` to my grandfather 's room . '' <EOS>	73.72313638654829
<SOS> `` i in m. noirtier 's apartment ? '' <EOS>	66.1298000210196
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	76.28724367572337
<SOS> `` can you mean it , valentine ? '' <EOS>	80.52342697972277
<SOS> `` i have long wished it ; he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help , come . '' <EOS>	65.31465920524384
<SOS> `` be careful , valentine , '' said morrel , hesitating to comply with the young girl 's wishes ; `` i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here . <EOS>	108.84697745888764
<SOS> are you sure you are more reasonable ? '' <EOS>	82.02833602230653
<SOS> `` yes , '' said valentine ; `` and i have but one scruple , that of leaving my dear grandmother 's remains , which i had undertaken to watch . '' <EOS>	112.1766741227585
<SOS> `` valentine , '' said morrel , `` death is in itself sacred . '' <EOS>	67.85199590772336
<SOS> `` yes , '' said valentine ; `` besides , it will not be for long . '' <EOS>	109.63919176111239
<SOS> she then crossed the corridor , and led the way down a narrow staircase to m. noirtier 's room ; morrel followed her on tiptoe ; at the door they found the old servant . <EOS>	66.18517641651395
<SOS> `` barrois , '' said valentine , `` shut the door , and let no one come in . '' <EOS>	53.41461174995995
<SOS> she passed first . <EOS>	80.65440751013185
<SOS> noirtier , seated in his chair , and listening to every sound , was watching the door ; he saw valentine , and his eye brightened . <EOS>	70.97447285955506
<SOS> there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man , and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate . <EOS>	96.08367572967263
<SOS> `` dear grandfather . '' <EOS>	100.03652079062044
<SOS> said she hurriedly , `` you know poor grandmamma died an hour since , and now i have no friend in the world but you . '' <EOS>	100.60362363030583
<SOS> his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness . <EOS>	81.31468574174117
<SOS> `` to you alone , then , may i confide my sorrows and my hopes ? '' <EOS>	101.41740299705066
<SOS> the paralytic motioned `` yes . '' <EOS>	106.23220618123715
<SOS> valentine took maximilian 's hand . <EOS>	108.0020155623662
<SOS> `` look attentively , then , at this gentleman . '' <EOS>	93.99284117185346
<SOS> the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel . <EOS>	80.06537102146622
<SOS> `` it is m. maximilian morrel , '' said she ; `` the son of that good merchant of marseilles , whom you doubtless recollect . '' <EOS>	84.07412425974161
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the old man . <EOS>	85.44198348669313
<SOS> `` he brings an irreproachable name , which maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the legion of honor . '' <EOS>	96.2102769747159
<SOS> the old man signified that he recollected him . <EOS>	93.77787895812135
<SOS> `` well , grandpapa , '' said valentine , kneeling before him , and pointing to maximilian , `` i love him , and will be only his ; were i compelled to marry another , i would destroy myself . '' <EOS>	58.79202667164309
<SOS> the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts . <EOS>	105.5267299143521
<SOS> `` you like m. maximilian morrel , do you not , grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	92.4794786382453
<SOS> asked valentine . <EOS>	81.31971476290644
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	72.93426492818477
<SOS> `` and you will protect us , who are your children , against the will of my father ? '' <EOS>	86.5713952959887
<SOS> noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel , as if to say , `` perhaps i may . '' <EOS>	81.68557495410485
<SOS> maximilian understood him . <EOS>	72.40849236937542
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , '' said he , `` you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother 's room , will you allow me the honor of a few minutes ' conversation with m . <EOS>	81.97892745815328
<SOS> noirtier ? '' <EOS>	70.95326119915084
<SOS> `` that is it , '' said the old man 's eye . <EOS>	65.68804326789082
<SOS> then he looked anxiously at valentine . <EOS>	82.57781858170686
<SOS> `` do you fear he will not understand ? '' <EOS>	90.08226997065454
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	97.16873520676485
<SOS> `` oh , we have so often spoken of you , that he knows exactly how i talk to you . '' <EOS>	92.06262535186494
<SOS> then turning to maximilian , with an adorable smile ; although shaded by sorrow , `` he knows everything i know , '' said she . <EOS>	77.10289524739376
<SOS> valentine arose , placed a chair for morrel , requested barrois not to admit anyone , and having tenderly embraced her grandfather , and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel , she went away . <EOS>	84.82049043831448
<SOS> to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine 's confidence and knew all their secrets , morrel took the dictionary , a pen , and some paper , and placed them all on a table where there was a light . <EOS>	95.78536158985074
<SOS> `` but first , '' said morrel , `` allow me , sir , to tell you who i am , how much i love mademoiselle valentine , and what are my designs respecting her . '' <EOS>	58.784356452940976
<SOS> noirtier made a sign that he would listen . <EOS>	72.13347650237857
<SOS> it was an imposing sight to witness this old man , apparently a mere useless burden , becoming the sole protector , support , and adviser of the lovers who were both young , beautiful , and strong . <EOS>	78.22980209724157
<SOS> his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel , who began his story with trembling . <EOS>	110.34586144412032
<SOS> he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine , and how he had loved her , and that valentine , in her solitude and her misfortune , had accepted the offer of his devotion . <EOS>	83.28680224190512
<SOS> he told him his birth , his position , his fortune , and more than once , when he consulted the look of the paralytic , that look answered , `` that is good , proceed . '' <EOS>	61.536270094542665
<SOS> `` and now , '' said morrel , when he had finished the first part of his recital , `` now i have told you of my love and my hopes , may i inform you of my intentions ? '' <EOS>	82.85556989346807
<SOS> `` yes , '' signified the old man . <EOS>	115.25061849532919
<SOS> `` this was our resolution ; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate , in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister 's house , to marry her , and to wait respectfully m. de villefort 's pardon . '' <EOS>	103.59391867386724
<SOS> `` no , '' said noirtier . <EOS>	74.34073160854011
<SOS> `` we must not do so ? '' <EOS>	108.17360639588054
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	76.25874575068237
<SOS> `` you do not sanction our project ? '' <EOS>	70.0227739350452
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	77.40137239161676
<SOS> `` there is another way , '' said morrel . <EOS>	100.71677175292648
<SOS> the old man 's interrogative eye said , `` which ? '' <EOS>	87.64818119258338
<SOS> `` i will go , '' continued maximilian , `` i will seek m. franz d'épinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort 's absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me . '' <EOS>	106.09200089969436
<SOS> noirtier 's look continued to interrogate . <EOS>	101.9870704351954
<SOS> `` you wish to know what i will do ? '' <EOS>	90.07570964507694
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	90.52373151633134
<SOS> `` i will find him , as i told you . <EOS>	81.54946894591788
<SOS> i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine ; if he be a sensible man , he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed , and will secure my friendship , and love until death ; if he refuse , either through interest or ridiculous pride , after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me , that valentine loves me , and will have no other , i will fight with him , give him every advantage , and i shall kill him , or he will kill me ; if i am victorious , he will not marry valentine , and if i die , i am very sure valentine will not marry him . '' <EOS>	64.52893516386175
<SOS> noirtier watched , with indescribable pleasure , this noble and sincere countenance , on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted , adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing . <EOS>	93.6265219454944
<SOS> still , when morrel had finished , he shut his eyes several times , which was his manner of saying `` no . '' <EOS>	86.82495768351856
<SOS> `` no ? '' <EOS>	94.80424586360203
<SOS> said morrel ; `` you disapprove of this second project , as you did of the first ? '' <EOS>	91.55438226362656
<SOS> `` i do , '' signified the old man . <EOS>	99.82151159767207
<SOS> `` but what then must be done ? '' <EOS>	87.17240216118209
<SOS> asked morrel . <EOS>	101.10748729109248
<SOS> `` madame de saint méran 's last request was , that the marriage might not be delayed ; must i let things take their course ? '' <EOS>	94.39267366203033
<SOS> noirtier did not move . <EOS>	76.76907557479271
<SOS> `` i understand , '' said morrel ; `` i am to wait . '' <EOS>	86.15788271961914
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	110.96928856968749
<SOS> `` but delay may ruin our plan , sir , '' replied the young man . <EOS>	60.464471785985836
<SOS> `` alone , valentine has no power ; she will be compelled to submit . <EOS>	72.10260242452439
<SOS> i am here almost miraculously , and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again . <EOS>	78.31281945448065
<SOS> believe me , there are only the two plans i have proposed to you ; forgive my vanity , and tell me which you prefer . <EOS>	91.9603684075167
<SOS> do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor ? '' <EOS>	81.2336450642832
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	70.51938186091995
<SOS> `` do you prefer i should seek m . <EOS>	94.91068042514124
<SOS> d'épinay ? '' <EOS>	89.32288132029903
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	93.4340815424202
<SOS> `` whence then will come the help we need from chance ? '' <EOS>	68.87081529765598
<SOS> resumed morrel . <EOS>	94.98166133971333
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	96.4223453447875
<SOS> `` from you ? '' <EOS>	71.36649236141052
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	93.05600820226397
<SOS> `` you thoroughly understand me , sir ? <EOS>	88.51966261748906
<SOS> pardon my eagerness , for my life depends on your answer . <EOS>	82.20738897944496
<SOS> will our help come from you ? '' <EOS>	82.31284762705472
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	90.55260259541794
<SOS> `` you are sure of it ? '' <EOS>	69.30652456199711
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	88.88771169495325
<SOS> there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer , no one could , at any rate , doubt his will , if they did his power . <EOS>	101.92758574353273
<SOS> `` oh , thank you a thousand times ! <EOS>	99.24572860204378
<SOS> but how , unless a miracle should restore your speech , your gesture , your movement , how can you , chained to that armchair , dumb and motionless , oppose this marriage ? '' <EOS>	69.56065041712209
<SOS> a smile lit up the old man 's face , a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face . <EOS>	82.97779121977489
<SOS> `` then i must wait ? '' <EOS>	96.82878317493038
<SOS> asked the young man . <EOS>	63.67347261103519
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	87.57262272436067
<SOS> `` but the contract ? '' <EOS>	74.97100801769484
<SOS> the same smile returned . <EOS>	102.86145350412855
<SOS> `` will you assure me it shall not be signed ? '' <EOS>	58.90846077419223
<SOS> `` yes , '' said noirtier . <EOS>	63.950921553701775
<SOS> `` the contract shall not be signed ! '' <EOS>	94.72746350107728
<SOS> cried morrel . <EOS>	78.91102775633658
<SOS> `` oh , pardon me , sir ; i can scarcely realize so great a happiness . <EOS>	73.63129732326708
<SOS> will they not sign it ? '' <EOS>	68.59316996390172
<SOS> `` no , '' said the paralytic . <EOS>	87.1913471129651
<SOS> notwithstanding that assurance , morrel still hesitated . <EOS>	83.13167735753933
<SOS> this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that , instead of being the result of the power of his will , it might emanate from enfeebled organs . <EOS>	75.98551577230766
<SOS> is it not natural that the madman , ignorant of his folly , should attempt things beyond his power ? <EOS>	93.46199662034755
<SOS> the weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself jupiter . <EOS>	90.91508501152512
<SOS> whether noirtier understood the young man 's indecision , or whether he had not full confidence in his docility , he looked uneasily at him . <EOS>	89.46751798121211
<SOS> `` what do you wish , sir ? '' <EOS>	68.58677036654343
<SOS> asked morrel ; `` that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil ? '' <EOS>	70.61372113091535
<SOS> noirtier 's eye remained fixed and firm , as if to imply that a promise did not suffice ; then it passed from his face to his hands . <EOS>	83.27495735084335
<SOS> `` shall i swear to you , sir ? '' <EOS>	102.98930860570471
<SOS> asked maximilian . <EOS>	86.69130149303514
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the paralytic with the same solemnity . <EOS>	80.03221117431427
<SOS> morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath . <EOS>	94.91943270391398
<SOS> he extended his hand . <EOS>	105.5846946604964
<SOS> `` i swear to you , on my honor , '' said he , `` to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m . <EOS>	71.78806770123131
<SOS> d'épinay . '' <EOS>	79.90800292255891
<SOS> `` that is right , '' said the old man . <EOS>	91.28362214960421
<SOS> `` now , '' said morrel , `` do you wish me to retire ? '' <EOS>	76.58310048433303
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	94.76840090780745
<SOS> `` without seeing mademoiselle valentine ? '' <EOS>	89.09579169091758
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	88.77990050784791
<SOS> morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey . <EOS>	89.5155031763816
<SOS> `` but , '' said he , `` first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now . '' <EOS>	62.54984397964158
<SOS> noirtier 's expression could not be understood . <EOS>	101.46059325522154
<SOS> the young man pressed his lips on the same spot , on the old man 's forehead , where valentine 's had been . <EOS>	73.12007000392337
<SOS> then he bowed a second time and retired . <EOS>	83.92556435182246
<SOS> he found outside the door the old servant , to whom valentine had given directions . <EOS>	73.9219550611563
<SOS> morrel was conducted along a dark passage , which led to a little door opening on the garden , soon found the spot where he had entered , with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall , and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him . <EOS>	111.30815294504205

<SOS> the villefort family vault two days after , a considerable crowd was assembled , towards ten o'clock in the morning , around the door of m. de villefort 's house , and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière . <EOS>	108.36098629594696
<SOS> among them was one of a very singular form , which appeared to have come from a distance . <EOS>	66.89944532313834
<SOS> it was a kind of covered wagon , painted black , and was one of the first to arrive . <EOS>	55.24764874496109
<SOS> inquiry was made , and it was ascertained that , by a strange coincidence , this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran , and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two . <EOS>	85.91210010716787
<SOS> their number was great . <EOS>	103.84974650445963
<SOS> the marquis de saint méran , one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii . <EOS>	70.93233363554432
<SOS> and king charles x. , had preserved a great number of friends , and these , added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on , formed a considerable body . <EOS>	98.52856368503853
<SOS> due information was given to the authorities , and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time . <EOS>	79.48865899641945
<SOS> a second hearse , decked with the same funereal pomp , was brought to m. de villefort 's door , and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon . <EOS>	110.17074851961054
<SOS> the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise , where m. de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family . <EOS>	110.10828776356502
<SOS> the remains of poor renée were already deposited there , and now , after ten years of separation , her father and mother were to be reunited with her . <EOS>	76.54203405948029
<SOS> the parisians , always curious , always affected by funereal display , looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles . <EOS>	112.76022683664492
<SOS> in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp , debray , and château renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness . <EOS>	68.21214312024868
<SOS> `` i saw madame de saint méran only last year at marseilles , when i was coming back from algiers , '' said château renaud ; `` she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old , from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body . <EOS>	80.03808460502175
<SOS> how old was she ? '' <EOS>	87.70357697384061
<SOS> `` franz assured me , '' replied albert , `` that she was sixty six years old . <EOS>	103.43841780132182
<SOS> but she has not died of old age , but of grief ; it appears that since the death of the marquis , which affected her very deeply , she has not completely recovered her reason . '' <EOS>	75.77346734428905
<SOS> `` but of what disease , then , did she die ? '' <EOS>	100.0714484590691
<SOS> asked debray . <EOS>	73.62269661808823
<SOS> `` it is said to have been a congestion of the brain , or apoplexy , which is the same thing , is it not ? '' <EOS>	66.67401261095375
<SOS> `` nearly . '' <EOS>	72.70337100697344
<SOS> `` it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy , '' said beauchamp . <EOS>	88.55181840746201
<SOS> `` madame de saint méran , whom i once saw , was short , of slender form , and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament ; grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran . '' <EOS>	63.24826718454695
<SOS> `` at any rate , '' said albert , `` whatever disease or doctor may have killed her , m. de villefort , or rather , mademoiselle valentine , or , still rather , our friend franz , inherits a magnificent fortune , amounting , i believe , to < num > , < num > livres per annum . '' <EOS>	73.42843080402824
<SOS> `` and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin , noirtier . '' <EOS>	87.35877039752252
<SOS> `` that is a tenacious old grandfather , '' said beauchamp. `` <EOS>	112.8088684314806
<SOS> tenacem propositi virum . <EOS>	74.44054688445983
<SOS> i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs , and he appears likely to succeed . <EOS>	103.37599135470798
<SOS> he resembles the old conventionalist of ' < num > , who said to napoleon , in < num > , 'you bend because your empire is a young stem , weakened by rapid growth . <EOS>	85.54783321008401
<SOS> take the republic for a tutor ; let us return with renewed strength to the battle field , and i promise you < num > , < num > soldiers , another marengo , and a second austerlitz . <EOS>	82.95523902765676
<SOS> ideas do not become extinct , sire ; they slumber sometimes , but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely . ' '' <EOS>	75.8901590678975
<SOS> `` ideas and men appeared the same to him , '' said albert . <EOS>	82.15527650494202
<SOS> `` one thing only puzzles me , namely , how franz d'épinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife . <EOS>	109.75024138251617
<SOS> but where is franz ? '' <EOS>	101.73344223595981
<SOS> `` in the first carriage , with m. de villefort , who considers him already as one of the family . '' <EOS>	98.13983431272722
<SOS> < num > m such was the conversation in almost all the carriages ; these two sudden deaths , so quickly following each other , astonished everyone , but no one suspected the terrible secret which m. d'avrigny had communicated , in his nocturnal walk to m. de villefort . <EOS>	81.97586990200872
<SOS> they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery ; the weather was mild , but dull , and in harmony with the funeral ceremony . <EOS>	87.87279893257866
<SOS> among the groups which flocked towards the family vault , château renaud recognized morrel , who had come alone in a cabriolet , and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees . <EOS>	81.15565212082778
<SOS> `` you here ? '' <EOS>	69.48033105201615
<SOS> said château renaud , passing his arms through the young captain 's ; `` are you a friend of villefort 's ? <EOS>	67.26112101363093
<SOS> how is it that i have never met you at his house ? '' <EOS>	65.1835586430968
<SOS> `` i am no acquaintance of m. de villefort 's , '' answered morrel , `` but i was of madame de saint méran . '' <EOS>	109.73384831420086
<SOS> albert came up to them at this moment with franz . <EOS>	92.26178852711658
<SOS> `` the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction . '' <EOS>	78.38974181135184
<SOS> said albert ; `` but we are not superstitious . <EOS>	84.91392818523187
<SOS> m. morrel , allow me to present to you m. franz d'épinay , a delightful travelling companion , with whom i made the tour of italy . <EOS>	79.25224965489959
<SOS> my dear franz , m. maximilian morrel , an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence , and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection , wit , or amiability . '' <EOS>	65.37726245323229
<SOS> morrel hesitated for a moment ; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing , but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory ; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz . <EOS>	74.7584174426894
<SOS> `` mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow , is she not ? '' <EOS>	84.83274336653896
<SOS> said debray to franz . <EOS>	65.84827523603752
<SOS> `` extremely , '' replied he ; `` she looked so pale this morning , i scarcely knew her . '' <EOS>	84.67824917594672
<SOS> these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart . <EOS>	73.7544484527655
<SOS> this man had seen valentine , and spoken to her ! <EOS>	98.05732846270668
<SOS> the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath . <EOS>	79.7856957406538
<SOS> he took the arm of château renaud , and turned towards the vault , where the attendants had already placed the two coffins . <EOS>	82.32114817976706
<SOS> `` this is a magnificent habitation , '' said beauchamp , looking towards the mausoleum ; `` a summer and winter palace . <EOS>	67.04613470922487
<SOS> you will , in turn , enter it , my dear d'épinay , for you will soon be numbered as one of the family . <EOS>	113.01192725022655
<SOS> i , as a philosopher , should like a little country house , a cottage down there under the trees , without so many free stones over my poor body . <EOS>	87.61202549615301
<SOS> in dying , i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron : ' eo rus , and all will be over . ' <EOS>	72.0274396689199
<SOS> but come , franz , take courage , your wife is an heiress . '' <EOS>	74.29775824172116
<SOS> `` indeed , beauchamp , you are unbearable . <EOS>	85.65894879200398
<SOS> politics has made you laugh at everything , and political men have made you disbelieve everything . <EOS>	100.63674427427804
<SOS> but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men , and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment , try to find your affectionate heart , which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber . '' <EOS>	95.08947379144227
<SOS> `` but tell me , '' said beauchamp , `` what is life ? <EOS>	102.29698797428541
<SOS> is it not a halt in death 's anteroom ? '' <EOS>	88.47006068214594
<SOS> < num > m `` i am prejudiced against beauchamp , '' said albert , drawing franz away , and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray . <EOS>	103.39558223005004
<SOS> the villefort vault formed a square of white stones , about twenty feet high ; an interior partition separated the two families , and each apartment had its entrance door . <EOS>	68.75687865368597
<SOS> here were not , as in other tombs , ignoble drawers , one above another , where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum ; all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room , separated by a wall from the vault itself . <EOS>	78.27229828815692
<SOS> the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall , and enclosed the villefort and saint méran coffins . <EOS>	80.39355063816384
<SOS> there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit père lachaise , or by lovers who make it their rendezvous . <EOS>	76.39094143207653
<SOS> the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right hand crypt belonging to the saint méran family . <EOS>	74.9123054560572
<SOS> villefort , franz , and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary . <EOS>	91.81886976339712
<SOS> as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door , and there was no address given , the party all separated ; château renaud , albert , and morrel , went one way , and debray and beauchamp the other . <EOS>	81.80597882758457
<SOS> franz remained with m. de villefort ; at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait ; he saw franz and m. de villefort get into the same mourning coach , and thought this meeting forboded evil . <EOS>	87.14180807202526
<SOS> he then returned to paris , and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert , he did not hear one word of their conversation . <EOS>	82.28669291766872
<SOS> as franz was about to take leave of m. de villefort , `` when shall i see you again ? '' <EOS>	84.50523578345039
<SOS> said the latter . <EOS>	86.43681547639007
<SOS> `` at what time you please , sir , '' replied franz . <EOS>	66.34774343986342
<SOS> `` as soon as possible . '' <EOS>	62.77137986446488
<SOS> `` i am at your command , sir ; shall we return together ? '' <EOS>	70.47974914645208
<SOS> `` if not unpleasant to you . '' <EOS>	84.0114687629903
<SOS> `` on the contrary , i shall feel much pleasure . '' <EOS>	86.2770825174356
<SOS> thus , the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage , and morrel , seeing them pass , became uneasy . <EOS>	72.34367669102016
<SOS> villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré . <EOS>	56.40959981888293
<SOS> the procureur , without going to see either his wife or his daughter , went at once to his study , and , offering the young man a chair : `` m. d'épinay , '' said he , `` allow me to remind you at this moment , which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear , for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb , allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint méran on her death bed , that valentine 's wedding might not be deferred . <EOS>	109.875192287721
<SOS> you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order , and her will bequeaths to valentine the entire property of the saint méran family ; the notary showed me the documents yesterday , which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately . <EOS>	66.02947667752602
<SOS> you may call on the notary , m. deschamps , place beauveau , faubourg saint honoré , and you have my authority to inspect those deeds . '' <EOS>	66.66409991170643
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied m. d'épinay , `` it is not , perhaps , the moment for mademoiselle valentine , who is in deep distress , to think of a husband ; indeed , i fear `` < num > m `` valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother 's last injunctions ; there will be no obstacle from that quarter , i assure you . '' <EOS>	91.42491764853287
<SOS> `` in that case , '' replied franz , `` as i shall raise none , you may make arrangements when you please ; i have pledged my word , and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it . '' <EOS>	69.26665390742411
<SOS> `` then , '' said villefort , `` nothing further is required . <EOS>	88.01156973319024
<SOS> the contract was to have been signed three days since ; we shall find it all ready , and can sign it today . '' <EOS>	63.91848569518122
<SOS> `` but the mourning ? '' <EOS>	89.57557794617786
<SOS> said franz , hesitating . <EOS>	84.09807915359025
<SOS> `` do n't be uneasy on that score , '' replied villefort ; `` no ceremony will be neglected in my house . <EOS>	79.39299160595493
<SOS> mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saint méran ; i say hers , for she inherits it today . <EOS>	82.2099993658565
<SOS> there , after a few days , if you like , the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony . <EOS>	77.44558778926387
<SOS> madame de saint méran wished her daughter should be married there . <EOS>	81.92235475519665
<SOS> when that is over , you , sir , can return to paris , while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law . '' <EOS>	67.2380120674235
<SOS> `` as you please , sir , '' said franz . <EOS>	93.2262125325361
<SOS> `` then , '' replied m. de villefort , `` have the kindness to wait half an hour ; valentine shall come down into the drawing room . <EOS>	69.93306224216755
<SOS> i will send for m. deschamps ; we will read and sign the contract before we separate , and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate , where we will rejoin them in a week . '' <EOS>	80.1971802239496
<SOS> `` sir , '' said franz , `` i have one request to make . '' <EOS>	86.11332684466798
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	78.17145074682033
<SOS> `` i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de château renaud to be present at this signature ; you know they are my witnesses . '' <EOS>	84.50252282315122
<SOS> `` half an hour will suffice to apprise them ; will you go for them yourself , or shall you send ? '' <EOS>	99.45762039837786
<SOS> `` i prefer going , sir . '' <EOS>	63.00171912590605
<SOS> `` i shall expect you , then , in half an hour , baron , and valentine will be ready . '' <EOS>	87.92104495603436
<SOS> franz bowed and left the room . <EOS>	101.48232647340775
<SOS> scarcely had the door closed , when m. de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour , as he expected the notary and m. d'épinay and his witnesses . <EOS>	71.78395172133553
<SOS> the news caused a great sensation throughout the house ; madame de villefort would not believe it , and valentine was thunderstruck . <EOS>	66.24970423682915
<SOS> she looked around for help , and would have gone down to her grandfather 's room , but on the stairs she met m. de villefort , who took her arm and led her into the drawing room . <EOS>	122.74641625233133
<SOS> in the anteroom , valentine met barrois , and looked despairingly at the old servant . <EOS>	118.00157802633649
<SOS> a moment later , madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward . <EOS>	100.6824521156233
<SOS> it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family , for she was pale and looked fatigued . <EOS>	106.25387426113032
<SOS> she sat down , took edward on her knees , and from time to time pressed this child , on whom her affections appeared centred , almost convulsively to her bosom . <EOS>	89.12534818657512
<SOS> two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard . <EOS>	75.76604901421751
<SOS> one was the notary 's ; the other , that of franz and his friends . <EOS>	77.63045064829507
<SOS> in a moment the whole party was assembled . <EOS>	62.734949385784425
<SOS> valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples , round her eyes and down her cheeks . <EOS>	93.08368316164355
<SOS> franz was deeply affected . <EOS>	104.56548420708431
<SOS> château renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement ; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin . <EOS>	86.7114829706837
<SOS> madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain , and as she constantly bent over her child , it was difficult to read the expression of her face . <EOS>	88.12379273397191
<SOS> m. de villefort was , as usual , unmoved . <EOS>	78.49185665328245
<SOS> the notary , after having , according to the customary method , arranged the papers on the table , taken his place in an armchair , and raised his spectacles , turned towards franz : `` are you m. franz de quesnel , baron d'épinay ? '' <EOS>	67.7602015379685
<SOS> asked he , although he knew it perfectly . <EOS>	99.38795455967932
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied franz . <EOS>	59.678711278576934
<SOS> the notary bowed . <EOS>	84.37845948749454
<SOS> `` i have , then , to inform you , sir , at the request of m. de villefort , that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m. noirtier towards his grandchild , and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her . <EOS>	103.28221887703883
<SOS> let me hasten to add , '' continued he , `` that the testator , having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune , and having alienated it all , the will will not bear scrutiny , and is declared null and void . '' <EOS>	56.94443753959481
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	75.30657794102997
<SOS> said villefort ; `` but i warn m. d'épinay , that during my life time my father 's will shall never be questioned , my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained . '' <EOS>	68.2850975388141
<SOS> < num > m `` sir , '' said franz , `` i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine ; i have never inquired the amount of her fortune , which , however limited it may be , exceeds mine . <EOS>	57.32899523113003
<SOS> my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m. de villefort ; all i seek is happiness . '' <EOS>	70.4369072658691
<SOS> valentine imperceptibly thanked him , while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks . <EOS>	70.70242944576674
<SOS> `` besides , sir , '' said villefort , addressing himself to his future son in law , `` excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes , this unexpected will need not personally wound you ; m. noirtier 's weakness of mind sufficiently explains it . <EOS>	78.72122221564936
<SOS> it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry , but because she will marry , a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow . <EOS>	86.55633647445232
<SOS> old age is selfish , sir , and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m. noirtier , which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d'épinay . <EOS>	77.07839962718893
<SOS> my father 's melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects , which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding , and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time , although , he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married , m. noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson . '' <EOS>	92.48737225807196
<SOS> m. de villefort had scarcely said this , when the door opened , and barrois appeared . <EOS>	95.2722065466112
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said he , in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances , `` gentlemen , m. noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m. franz de quesnel , baron d'épinay . '' <EOS>	97.16666207272625
<SOS> he , as well as the notary , that there might be no mistake in the person , gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect . <EOS>	77.43562009584588
<SOS> villefort started , madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees , valentine rose , pale and dumb as a statue . <EOS>	93.25806124239345
<SOS> albert and château renaud exchanged a second look , more full of amazement than the first . <EOS>	84.97547518962813
<SOS> the notary looked at villefort . <EOS>	98.40583563831818
<SOS> `` it is impossible , '' said the procureur . <EOS>	77.3731978999666
<SOS> `` m. d'épinay can not leave the drawing room at present . '' <EOS>	79.23789461136677
<SOS> `` it is at this moment , '' replied barrois with the same firmness , `` that m. noirtier , my master , wishes to speak on important subjects to m. franz d'épinay . '' <EOS>	67.03219193927211
<SOS> `` grandpapa noirtier can speak now , then , '' said edward , with his habitual quickness . <EOS>	81.06685779903646
<SOS> however , his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile , so much was every mind engaged , and so solemn was the situation . <EOS>	61.44283662590065
<SOS> `` tell m. nortier , '' resumed villefort , `` that what he demands is impossible . '' <EOS>	91.35951987486447
<SOS> `` then , m. nortier gives notice to these gentlemen , '' replied barrois , `` that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room . '' <EOS>	58.096876663838984
<SOS> astonishment was at its height . <EOS>	79.82596446069488
<SOS> something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort 's countenance . <EOS>	70.58509489112711
<SOS> valentine instinctively raised her eyes , as if to thank heaven . <EOS>	78.05787521243059
<SOS> `` pray go , valentine , '' said ; m. de villefort , `` and see what this new fancy of your grandfather 's is . '' <EOS>	91.36514662395307
<SOS> valentine rose quickly , and was hastening joyfully towards the door , when m. de villefort altered his intention . <EOS>	89.7228123389706
<SOS> `` stop , '' said he ; `` i will go with you . '' <EOS>	78.66507349036735

<SOS> and without listening to villefort he arose , and followed valentine , who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to . <EOS>	71.985816269946
<SOS> m. de villefort followed them . <EOS>	80.73442258155603

<SOS> he motioned to valentine to approach . <EOS>	92.61236204874078
<SOS> in a moment , thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather , she understood that he asked for a key . <EOS>	109.9772134117899
<SOS> then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows . <EOS>	99.07261530454545
<SOS> she opened the drawer , and found a key ; and , understanding that was what he wanted , again watched his eyes , which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents . <EOS>	59.90661604406079
<SOS> `` shall i open the secretaire ? '' <EOS>	116.23388901871631

<SOS> `` but there are no more , '' said she . <EOS>	60.464342315717985

<SOS> valentine went to the door , and called barrois . <EOS>	65.64270660564357
<SOS> villefort 's impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead , and franz was stupefied . <EOS>	80.17818313526426
<SOS> the old servant came . <EOS>	98.6749598173266
<SOS> `` barrois , '' said valentine , `` my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire , but there is a secret spring in it , which you know will you open it ? '' <EOS>	98.55068566633452
<SOS> barrois looked at the old man . <EOS>	75.84173104651953
<SOS> `` obey , '' said noirtier 's intelligent eye . <EOS>	91.13679239995334
<SOS> barrois touched a spring , the false bottom came out , and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string . <EOS>	77.35493882624549
<SOS> `` is that what you wish for ? '' <EOS>	84.58365960519318

<SOS> `` to me , sir ? '' <EOS>	70.13907217187598
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	59.876888456306325
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	83.03008671295294
<SOS> franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover , read : `` 'to be given , after my death , to general durand , who shall bequeath the packet to his son , with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document . ' <EOS>	53.67523508317408
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' asked franz , `` what do you wish me to do with this paper ? '' <EOS>	90.99919915949472
<SOS> `` to preserve it , sealed up as it is , doubtless , '' said the procureur . <EOS>	95.31979090232775
<SOS> `` no , '' replied noirtier eagerly . <EOS>	84.6517498140346
<SOS> `` do you wish him to read it ? '' <EOS>	81.23371141264774
<SOS> said valentine . <EOS>	79.50469980529864
<SOS> `` yes , '' replied the old man . <EOS>	74.18291861770496
<SOS> `` you understand , baron , my grandfather wishes you to read this paper , '' said valentine . <EOS>	74.00646751033923
<SOS> `` then let us sit down , '' said villefort impatiently , `` for it will take some time . '' <EOS>	102.73904625782056
<SOS> `` sit down , '' said the old man . <EOS>	82.18377377615676
<SOS> villefort took a chair , but valentine remained standing by her father 's side , and franz before him , holding the mysterious paper in his hand . <EOS>	69.66362738735154
<SOS> `` read , '' said the old man . <EOS>	89.19715923463343
<SOS> franz untied it , and in the midst of the most profound silence read : < num > m `` ' extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques , held february < num > th , < num > . ' '' <EOS>	107.49882692553369

<SOS> `` february < num > th , < num > ! '' <EOS>	69.29149335920408
<SOS> said he ; `` it is the day my father was murdered . '' <EOS>	74.7275718485018
<SOS> valentine and villefort were dumb ; the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly , `` go on . '' <EOS>	100.80667693408348
<SOS> `` but it was on leaving this club , '' said he , `` my father disappeared . '' <EOS>	74.6161358001278
<SOS> noirtier 's eye continued to say , `` read . '' <EOS>	95.43193268350251
<SOS> he resumed : `` 'the undersigned louis jacques beaurepaire , lieutenant colonel of artillery , étienne duchampy , general of brigade , and claude lecharpal , keeper of woods and forests , declare , that on the < num > th of february , a letter arrived from the island of elba , recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club , general flavien de quesnel , who having served the emperor from < num > to < num > was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon dynasty , notwithstanding the title of baron which louis xviii . <EOS>	114.30564611496364
<SOS> had just granted to him with his estate of épinay . <EOS>	65.25968145252142
<SOS> < num > m `` ' a note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel , begging him to be present at the meeting next day , the < num > th . <EOS>	67.43554015995429
<SOS> the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held ; it bore no signature , but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o'clock . <EOS>	56.525915430971835
<SOS> the meetings were always held from that time till midnight . <EOS>	88.51687898727079
<SOS> at nine o'clock the president of the club presented himself ; the general was ready , the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting , and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged , swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage . <EOS>	70.16248658614566
<SOS> general de quesnel accepted the condition , and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took . <EOS>	109.97843779646975
<SOS> the general 's carriage was ready , but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it , since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went . <EOS>	72.15595573001141
<SOS> `` what must be done then ? '' <EOS>	65.20886691054297
<SOS> asked the general . <EOS>	94.15211682482722
<SOS> `` i have my carriage here , '' said the president . <EOS>	57.95299005421333
<SOS> `` ' '' have you , then , so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know ? '' <EOS>	76.18357993662224
<SOS> `` ' '' our coachman is a member of the club , '' said the president ; `` we shall be driven by a state councillor . '' <EOS>	81.10927767224675
<SOS> `` ' '' then we run another risk , '' said the general , laughing , `` that of being upset . '' <EOS>	75.46826285198837
<SOS> we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting , but that he came willingly . <EOS>	64.35729823839847
<SOS> when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged , to which he made no opposition . <EOS>	104.8025534945888
<SOS> on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief , and reminded him of his oath . <EOS>	94.74936096987926
<SOS> `` sure enough , '' said the general . <EOS>	71.68476681604082
<SOS> the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques . <EOS>	89.85911397132689
<SOS> the general alighted , leaning on the arm of the president , of whose dignity he was not aware , considering him simply as a member of the club ; they went through the alley , mounted a flight of stairs , and entered the assembly room . <EOS>	88.57543558697817
<SOS> `` 'the deliberations had already begun . <EOS>	74.11349560175674
<SOS> the members , apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening , were all in attendance . <EOS>	88.75140726415839
<SOS> when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage , he did so immediately , and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant . <EOS>	104.70701342153271
<SOS> they questioned him as to his sentiments , but he contented himself with answering , that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them ' '' franz interrupted himself by saying , `` my father was a royalist ; they need not have asked his sentiments , which were well known . '' <EOS>	77.63994641298066
<SOS> `` and hence , '' said villefort , `` arose my affection for your father , my dear m. franz . <EOS>	110.74832924214947
<SOS> opinions held in common are a ready bond of union . '' <EOS>	87.09527502937516
<SOS> `` read again , '' said the old man . <EOS>	69.7582288364144
<SOS> franz continued : `` 'the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly , but m. de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him . <EOS>	76.77972246658629
<SOS> he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party . <EOS>	93.70835051476271
<SOS> one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details , on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel , of marseilles , whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor . <EOS>	97.24776375070404
<SOS> during all this time , the general , on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother , manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance . <EOS>	94.44305638911621
<SOS> when the reading was finished , he remained silent , with knitted brows . <EOS>	78.02144253896334
<SOS> `` ' '' well , '' asked the president , `` what do you say to this letter , general ? '' <EOS>	78.07561890458608
<SOS> `` ' '' i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii . <EOS>	79.44349660864209
<SOS> to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor . '' <EOS>	65.98378369087415
<SOS> this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments . <EOS>	79.2725040738247
<SOS> `` general , '' said the president , `` we acknowledge no king louis xviii. , or an ex emperor , but his majesty the emperor and king , driven from france , which is his kingdom , by violence and treason . '' <EOS>	103.25452646578995
<SOS> `` ' '' excuse me , gentlemen , '' said the general ; `` you may not acknowledge louis xviii. , but i do , as he has made me a baron and a field marshal , and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france . '' <EOS>	79.64836449677021
<SOS> `` ' '' sir , '' said the president , rising with gravity , `` be careful what you say ; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba , and have deceived us ! <EOS>	101.85060468343103
<SOS> the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you , and which does you honor . <EOS>	98.5342378519683
<SOS> now we discover our error ; a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn . <EOS>	75.06293914267987
<SOS> we will not constrain you to help us ; we enroll no one against his conscience , but we will compel you to act generously , even if you are not disposed to do so . '' <EOS>	64.65991173135185
<SOS> `` ' '' you would call acting generously , knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you , that is what i should call becoming your accomplice . <EOS>	98.78605629500966

<SOS> `` ah , my father ! '' <EOS>	104.02223366265281
<SOS> said franz , interrupting himself . <EOS>	101.5376415907947
<SOS> `` i understand now why they murdered him . '' <EOS>	90.16692583048346
<SOS> valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man , whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold . <EOS>	86.04477523886777
<SOS> villefort walked to and fro behind them . <EOS>	75.34121284249858
<SOS> noirtier watched the expression of each one , and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude . <EOS>	95.19528189519862
<SOS> franz returned to the manuscript , and continued : `` ' '' sir , '' said the president , `` you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here ; it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted . <EOS>	76.5149825309885
<SOS> when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii. , or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police . <EOS>	78.90116483165099
<SOS> it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret , and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you . <EOS>	108.8104456265691
<SOS> no , no , you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns , or for his majesty the emperor . '' <EOS>	71.243751846466
<SOS> `` ' '' i am a royalist , '' replied the general ; `` i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii. , and i will adhere to it . '' <EOS>	62.13817900253191
<SOS> these words were followed by a general murmur , and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness . <EOS>	89.732317654251
<SOS> `` 'the president again arose , and having imposed silence , said , `` sir , you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation , and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you .

<SOS> the general , putting his hand on his sword , exclaimed , `` if you talk of honor , do not begin by disavowing its laws , and impose nothing by violence . '' <EOS>	75.80857325260658
<SOS> `` ' '' and you , sir , '' continued the president , with a calmness still more terrible than the general 's anger , `` i advise you not to touch your sword . '' <EOS>	109.31243977133683
<SOS> the general looked around him with slight uneasiness ; however he did not yield , but calling up all his fortitude , said , `` i will not swear . '' <EOS>	98.57133052983323
<SOS> `` ' '' then you must die , '' replied the president calmly . <EOS>	97.07357903989238
<SOS> m. d'épinay became very pale ; he looked round him a second time , several members of the club were whispering , and getting their arms from under their cloaks . <EOS>	116.90831926110324
<SOS> `` general , '' said the president , `` do not alarm yourself ; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity , but as you have said , you are among conspirators , you are in possession of our secret , and you must restore it to us . '' <EOS>	68.26552149562866
<SOS> a significant silence followed these words , and as the general did not reply , `` close the doors , '' said the president to the door keeper . <EOS>	88.05268705153232
<SOS> < num > m `` 'the same deadly silence succeeded these words . <EOS>	87.4670142385247

<SOS> `` ' '' general , '' said the chief of the assembly , `` one man may insult fifty it is the privilege of weakness . <EOS>	93.79290774500427

<SOS> the general , again daunted by the superiority of the chief , hesitated a moment ; then advancing to the president 's desk , `` what is the form , said he . <EOS>	70.36306594831115
<SOS> `` ' '' it is this : ' i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the < num > th of february , < num > , between nine and ten o'clock in the evening ; and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath . ' '' <EOS>	83.71105830752926
<SOS> the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor , which prevented his answering for some moments ; then , overcoming his manifest repugnance , he pronounced the required oath , but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members , who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly , which he did . <EOS>	81.04223875763715

<SOS> but instead of listening , m. d'épinay went on , `` you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one . '' <EOS>	110.3152924704148
<SOS> the president stopped the coach . <EOS>	62.61399729075311
<SOS> they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river . <EOS>	97.63636708273197
<SOS> `` why do you stop here ? '' <EOS>	80.95188876193477
<SOS> asked d'épinay . <EOS>	89.09945221891248
<SOS> `` ' '' because , sir , '' said the president , `` you have insulted a man , and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation . '' <EOS>	70.48197156383497

<SOS> `` ' '' make no noise , sir , unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards , who take their weakness for a shield . <EOS>	77.45743788627816

<SOS> `` at last , '' said he , `` i shall know with whom i have to do . '' <EOS>	65.0773358073443
<SOS> they opened the door and the four men alighted . ' '' <EOS>	95.3624437070255
<SOS> franz again interrupted himself , and wiped the cold drops from his brow ; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father 's death , which had hitherto been a mystery . <EOS>	65.1520138865829
<SOS> valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer . <EOS>	56.06478627646077
<SOS> noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride . <EOS>	87.08959747664139
<SOS> franz continued : `` 'it was , as we said , the fifth of february . <EOS>	83.40303916394625
<SOS> for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice . <EOS>	91.78600290909418
<SOS> the general was stout and tall , the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down . <EOS>	96.86216514923365
<SOS> the two witnesses followed . <EOS>	85.83222536762469
<SOS> it was a dark night . <EOS>	66.11476136610257
<SOS> the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost , the water of the river looked black and deep . <EOS>	102.87721184333505
<SOS> one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near , and by its light they examined the weapons . <EOS>	84.83013837861617
<SOS> the president 's sword , which was simply , as he had said , one he carried in his cane , was five inches shorter than the general 's , and had no guard . <EOS>	76.47285228777828
<SOS> the general proposed to cast lots for the swords , but the president said it was he who had given the provocation , and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms . <EOS>	85.36494109470185
<SOS> the witnesses endeavored to insist , but the president bade them be silent . <EOS>	91.16058206345916
<SOS> the lantern was placed on the ground , the two adversaries took their stations , and the duel began . <EOS>	104.11732390157708
<SOS> the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning ; as for the men , they were scarcely perceptible , the darkness was so great . <EOS>	114.01088314626047
<SOS> < num > m `` 'general d'épinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army , but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell . <EOS>	59.1540615352218
<SOS> the witnesses thought he was dead , but his adversary , who knew he had not struck him , offered him the assistance of his hand to rise . <EOS>	93.20421935680461
<SOS> the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general , and he rushed on his adversary . <EOS>	78.52933923197679
<SOS> but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken . <EOS>	76.09308261237389
<SOS> he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged , and then returned to the charge . <EOS>	80.64569485040265
<SOS> at the third he fell again . <EOS>	85.04089506905413
<SOS> they thought he slipped , as at first , and the witnesses , seeing he did not move , approached and endeavored to raise him , but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood . <EOS>	73.21908881741535
<SOS> the general , who had almost fainted , revived . <EOS>	85.03165741158064

<SOS> still he had not even uttered a sigh . <EOS>	93.50510137378313
<SOS> general d'épinay died five minutes after . ' '' <EOS>	91.01509035827576
<SOS> franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible , and then stopped , passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud ; but after a moment 's silence , he continued : `` 'the president went up the steps , after pushing his sword into his cane ; a track of blood on the snow marked his course . <EOS>	72.1589350341219
<SOS> he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general 's body , which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead . <EOS>	69.33895845013924
<SOS> the general fell , then , in a loyal duel , and not in ambush as it might have been reported . <EOS>	94.62224963489624
<SOS> in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts , lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor . <EOS>	120.85525770773329
<SOS> `` 'signed , beaurepaire , duchampy , and lecharpal . ' '' <EOS>	90.3105379897375
<SOS> when franz had finished reading this account , so dreadful for a son ; when valentine , pale with emotion , had wiped away a tear ; when villefort , trembling , and crouched in a corner , had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man , `` sir , '' said d'épinay to noirtier , `` since you are well acquainted with all these details , which are attested by honorable signatures , since you appear to take some interest in me , although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow , refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club , that i may at least know who killed my father . '' <EOS>	81.96253894101869
<SOS> villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door ; valentine , who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather 's answer , and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm , drew back a few steps . <EOS>	80.81052143320065
<SOS> `` mademoiselle , '' said franz , turning towards valentine , `` unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age . '' <EOS>	88.57639178093204
<SOS> valentine remained dumb and motionless . <EOS>	108.6965649187382
<SOS> `` hold , sir , '' said villefort , `` do not prolong this dreadful scene . <EOS>	59.24358449886436
<SOS> the names have been purposely concealed ; my father himself does not know who this president was , and if he knows , he can not tell you ; proper names are not in the dictionary . '' <EOS>	92.69797768748376
<SOS> `` oh , misery , '' cried franz : `` the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing , at least , the name of him who killed my father ! <EOS>	72.03039617104987

<SOS> noirtier looked at the dictionary . <EOS>	80.09339550817367
<SOS> franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively , until he came to m. at that letter the old man signified `` yes . '' <EOS>	107.35520543655625
<SOS> `` m , '' repeated franz . <EOS>	91.22033169763995
<SOS> the young man 's finger , glided over the words , but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign . <EOS>	83.52014479247985
<SOS> valentine hid her head between her hands . <EOS>	76.32251763245543
<SOS> at length , franz arrived at the word myself . <EOS>	92.6054516560903

<SOS> `` you ! '' <EOS>	83.68649853320862

<SOS> `` yes ! '' <EOS>	106.47682640663089
<SOS> replied noirtier , fixing a majestic look on the young man . <EOS>	65.3840973059896
<SOS> franz fell powerless on a chair ; villefort opened the door and escaped , for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man . <EOS>	93.1518977043901

<SOS> progress of cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m. cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service , not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria , but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca , of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers . <EOS>	110.63697082132406
<SOS> he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father . <EOS>	88.53303180933786
<SOS> m. andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari . <EOS>	109.21993721831832
<SOS> he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners , and treats them , not as they really are , but as they wish to be considered . <EOS>	95.18922601640055
<SOS> besides , what is required of a young man in paris ? <EOS>	110.52020405960229
<SOS> to speak its language tolerably , to make a good appearance , to be a good gamester , and to pay in cash . <EOS>	85.96122134943218
<SOS> they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman . <EOS>	83.29250260888715
<SOS> andrea had , then , in a fortnight , attained a very fair position . <EOS>	86.77561543245876
<SOS> he was called count , he was said to possess < num > , < num > livres per annum ; and his father 's immense riches , buried in the quarries of saravezza , were a constant theme . <EOS>	105.80624370763276
<SOS> a learned man , before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact , declared he had seen the quarries in question , which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful , but which now assumed the garb of reality . <EOS>	97.37532789480414
<SOS> such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers , when monte cristo went one evening to pay m. danglars a visit . <EOS>	76.27524689213662
<SOS> m. danglars was out , but the count was asked to go and see the baroness , and he accepted the invitation . <EOS>	95.93733600501943
<SOS> it was never without a nervous shudder , since the dinner at auteuil , and the events which followed it , that madame danglars heard monte cristo 's name announced . <EOS>	69.29851671921006
<SOS> if he did not come , the painful sensation became most intense ; if , on the contrary , he appeared , his noble countenance , his brilliant eyes , his amiability , his polite attention even towards madame danglars , soon dispelled every impression of fear . <EOS>	81.98748412684242
<SOS> it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her ; besides , the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind . <EOS>	95.82919625224112
<SOS> < num > m when monte cristo entered the boudoir , to which we have already once introduced our readers , and where the baroness was examining some drawings , which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m. cavalcanti , his presence soon produced its usual effect , and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count , although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name . <EOS>	88.2784517280956
<SOS> the latter took in the whole scene at a glance . <EOS>	66.59479375580928
<SOS> the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa , eugénie sat near her , and cavalcanti was standing . <EOS>	61.90070794677075
<SOS> cavalcanti , dressed in black , like one of goethe 's heroes , with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings , passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair , and so displayed a sparkling diamond , that in spite of monte cristo 's advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger . <EOS>	91.90081259819416
<SOS> this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars , and by sighs launched in the same direction . <EOS>	91.92202260965242
<SOS> mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold , beautiful , and satirical . <EOS>	58.49844782685945
<SOS> not one of these glances , nor one sigh , was lost on her ; they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva , which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho . <EOS>	70.8712830561983
<SOS> eugénie bowed coldly to the count , and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study , whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m. cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d'armilly , her singing teacher . <EOS>	91.73262839204422
<SOS> it was then , especially while conversing with madame danglars , and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation , that the count noticed m. andrea cavalcanti 's solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of manifesting his admiration . <EOS>	111.77851278725292
<SOS> the banker soon returned . <EOS>	66.4441711853756
<SOS> his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo , but the second was for andrea . <EOS>	61.14440490532221
<SOS> as for his wife , he bowed to her , as some husbands do to their wives , but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend , until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life . <EOS>	114.88274471248234
<SOS> `` have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano ? '' <EOS>	102.37023781254764
<SOS> said danglars to andrea . <EOS>	67.53914382465422
<SOS> `` alas , no , sir , '' replied andrea with a sigh , still more remarkable than the former ones . <EOS>	95.21960255890329
<SOS> danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it . <EOS>	89.42317214728023
<SOS> < num > m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair , at the piano , accompanying themselves , each with one hand , a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves , and performed admirably . <EOS>	73.76503466261389
<SOS> mademoiselle d'armilly , whom they then perceived through the open doorway , formed with eugénie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond . <EOS>	60.742809514585396
<SOS> she was somewhat beautiful , and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure , with large curls falling on her neck , which was rather too long , as perugino sometimes makes his virgins , and her eyes dull from fatigue . <EOS>	83.78226119830313
<SOS> she was said to have a weak chest , and like antonia in the cremona violin , she would die one day while singing . <EOS>	61.87816822004289
<SOS> monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum ; it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d'armilly , of whom he had heard much . <EOS>	73.5347400515436
<SOS> `` well , '' said the banker to his daughter , `` are we then all to be excluded ? '' <EOS>	117.21598159829712
<SOS> he then led the young man into the study , and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea , so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything ; but as the banker had accompanied andrea , madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it . <EOS>	79.64204123764857
<SOS> the count soon heard andrea 's voice , singing a corsican song , accompanied by the piano . <EOS>	99.33719628629987
<SOS> while the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto , madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband 's strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan . <EOS>	99.85175572243938
<SOS> the praise was well deserved , for had not the count heard it from the baroness , or by one of those means by which he knew everything , the baron 's countenance would not have led him to suspect it . <EOS>	73.7806477381893
<SOS> `` hem , '' thought monte cristo , `` he begins to conceal his losses ; a month since he boasted of them . '' <EOS>	89.84832009712619
<SOS> then aloud , `` oh , madame , m. danglars is so skilful , he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere . '' <EOS>	106.4437206225201
<SOS> `` i see that you participate in a prevalent error , '' said madame danglars . <EOS>	98.77207641381187
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	73.13327486365219
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	123.28505064001237
<SOS> `` that m. danglars speculates , whereas he never does . '' <EOS>	79.58064783299987
<SOS> `` truly , madame , i recollect m. debray told me apropos , what has become of him ? <EOS>	71.64554243362707
<SOS> i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days . '' <EOS>	102.33800521473322
<SOS> `` nor i , '' said madame danglars ; `` but you began a sentence , sir , and did not finish . '' <EOS>	75.89696845808716
<SOS> `` which ? '' <EOS>	65.2365939582552
<SOS> `` m. debray had told you `` `` ah , yes ; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation . '' <EOS>	106.65891042721701
<SOS> `` i was once very fond of it , but i do not indulge now . '' <EOS>	71.41839426205662
<SOS> `` then you are wrong , madame . <EOS>	64.6587504531467

<SOS> well , i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him , even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him . '' <EOS>	100.67436511981951
<SOS> madame danglars blushed , in spite of all her efforts . <EOS>	67.03198980711475
<SOS> `` stay , '' said monte cristo , as though he had not observed her confusion , `` i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds . '' <EOS>	97.39529982975812
<SOS> `` i have none nor have i ever possessed any ; but really we have talked long enough of money , count , we are like two stockbrokers ; have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts ? '' <EOS>	67.79801006820678
<SOS> `` what has happened ? '' <EOS>	83.0077282415094
<SOS> said the count , simulating total ignorance . <EOS>	118.30779356984934
<SOS> `` you know the marquis of saint méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris , and the marchioness a few days after her arrival ? '' <EOS>	90.78943559243137
<SOS> `` yes , '' said monte cristo , `` i have heard that ; but , as claudius said to hamlet , 'it is a law of nature ; their fathers died before them , and they mourned their loss ; they will die before their children , who will , in their turn , grieve for them . ' '' <EOS>	86.83825623668265
<SOS> `` but that is not all . '' <EOS>	85.89825052492668
<SOS> `` not all ! '' <EOS>	59.430858286217315
<SOS> `` no ; they were going to marry their daughter `` `` to m. franz d'épinay . <EOS>	108.26691835777368
<SOS> is it broken off ? '' <EOS>	91.27442902130196
<SOS> `` yesterday morning , it appears , franz declined the honor . '' <EOS>	60.29775651609755
<SOS> `` indeed ? <EOS>	73.00128917043477
<SOS> and is the reason known ? '' <EOS>	102.3997724876532
<SOS> `` no . '' <EOS>	108.24097410967546
<SOS> `` how extraordinary ! <EOS>	93.1104734886868

<SOS> `` as usual . <EOS>	79.98924819782475
<SOS> like a philosopher . '' <EOS>	90.229165567857
<SOS> danglars returned at this moment alone . <EOS>	62.99862316374495
<SOS> `` well , '' said the baroness , `` do you leave m. cavalcanti with your daughter ? '' <EOS>	84.71840177932889
<SOS> `` and mademoiselle d'armilly , '' said the banker ; `` do you consider her no one ? '' <EOS>	110.90823793553922
<SOS> then , turning to monte cristo , he said , `` prince cavalcanti is a charming young man , is he not ? <EOS>	78.00950022201542
<SOS> but is he really a prince ? '' <EOS>	83.05496072816373
<SOS> `` i will not answer for it , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	90.64737747790146
<SOS> `` his father was introduced to me as a marquis , so he ought to be a count ; but i do not think he has much claim to that title . '' <EOS>	103.88555998399704
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	97.86455894617795
<SOS> said the banker . <EOS>	90.4605219581887
<SOS> `` if he is a prince , he is wrong not to maintain his rank ; i do not like anyone to deny his origin . '' <EOS>	61.226065587953045
<SOS> `` oh , you are a thorough democrat , '' said monte cristo , smiling . <EOS>	76.02032580982527
<SOS> `` but do you see to what you are exposing yourself ? '' <EOS>	80.99597373275705

<SOS> `` you may well say , perchance , '' replied the banker ; `` for he comes so seldom , it would seem only chance that brings him . '' <EOS>	84.0873470326337

<SOS> you are mistaken . <EOS>	107.66025134463345

<SOS> the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf . <EOS>	93.84098997621511
<SOS> the baroness rose hastily , and was going into the study , when danglars stopped her . <EOS>	79.10169251703779
<SOS> `` let her alone , '' said he . <EOS>	75.22266184824947
<SOS> she looked at him in amazement . <EOS>	71.61923307761666
<SOS> monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed . <EOS>	91.21360524858953
<SOS> albert entered , looking very handsome and in high spirits . <EOS>	69.7962769246577
<SOS> he bowed politely to the baroness , familiarly to danglars , and affectionately to monte cristo . <EOS>	114.59726029586203
<SOS> then turning to the baroness : `` may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is ? '' <EOS>	73.78243162844709
<SOS> said he . <EOS>	81.32788827449444
<SOS> `` she is quite well , '' replied danglars quickly ; `` she is at the piano with m . <EOS>	102.06089133701401
<SOS> cavalcanti . '' <EOS>	93.77712289020322
<SOS> albert retained his calm and indifferent manner ; he might feel perhaps annoyed , but he knew monte cristo 's eye was on him . <EOS>	88.32657310599048
<SOS> `` m. cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice , '' said he , `` and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano , and then she plays the piano like thalberg . <EOS>	88.06784513780455
<SOS> the concert must be a delightful one . '' <EOS>	62.32310691412332
<SOS> `` they suit each other remarkably well , '' said danglars . <EOS>	81.86363512038228
<SOS> albert appeared not to notice this remark , which was , however , so rude that madame danglars blushed . <EOS>	80.91382667598819
<SOS> `` i , too , '' said the young man , `` am a musician at least , my masters used to tell me so ; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other , and a soprano less than any . '' <EOS>	116.66037261813756
<SOS> danglars smiled , and seemed to say , `` it is of no consequence . '' <EOS>	92.01785973118136
<SOS> then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , `` the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday . <EOS>	75.39169217301908

<SOS> i regret not having heard them . <EOS>	102.52074396592316
<SOS> but i was unable to accept your invitation , having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud . '' <EOS>	98.80050837086566

<SOS> but he can easily become one , if he is not already ; it is no uncommon thing in italy . <EOS>	76.93550521459473
<SOS> but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat , danglars , without telling them there is a stranger . <EOS>	93.16427939940297
<SOS> ask them to sing one more song ; it is so delightful to hear music in the distance , when the musicians are unrestrained by observation . '' <EOS>	62.94973861903257
<SOS> danglars was quite annoyed by the young man 's indifference . <EOS>	76.24643703394081
<SOS> he took monte cristo aside . <EOS>	90.07477822069943
<SOS> `` what do you think of our lover ? '' <EOS>	84.38252013729313

<SOS> `` oh , do n't worry about me , sir mocker , '' said danglars ; then turning to monte cristo he said : `` but will you undertake to speak to the father ? '' <EOS>	94.41087397773154

<SOS> cried morcerf , parodying the banker , as the selection came to an end . <EOS>	100.39231317380779
<SOS> danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf , when someone came and whispered a few words to him . <EOS>	80.84618513611143
<SOS> `` i shall soon return , '' said the banker to monte cristo ; `` wait for me . <EOS>	109.8040068873198

<SOS> and he went out . <EOS>	87.4251174674423
<SOS> the baroness took advantage of her husband 's absence to push open the door of her daughter 's study , and m. andrea , who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie , started up like a jack in the box . <EOS>	105.7493255808862
<SOS> albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness . <EOS>	93.117129089071
<SOS> cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed ; he bowed to morcerf , who replied with the most impertinent look possible . <EOS>	97.94699478035093
<SOS> then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars ' voice , and on his regret , after what he had just heard , that he had been unable to be present the previous evening . <EOS>	65.33698989209219
<SOS> cavalcanti , being left alone , turned to monte cristo . <EOS>	78.91995341957939
<SOS> `` come , '' said madame danglars , `` leave music and compliments , and let us go and take tea . '' <EOS>	93.11021355102352
<SOS> `` come , louise , '' said mademoiselle danglars to her friend . <EOS>	57.27472855800025
<SOS> they passed into the next drawing room , where tea was prepared . <EOS>	93.79934601955931
<SOS> just as they were beginning , in the english fashion , to leave the spoons in their cups , the door again opened and danglars entered , visibly agitated . <EOS>	94.53214266205218
<SOS> monte cristo observed it particularly , and by a look asked the banker for an explanation . <EOS>	97.09020114142753
<SOS> `` i have just received my courier from greece , '' said danglars . <EOS>	66.37892847744463

<SOS> `` how is king otho getting on ? '' <EOS>	112.72021963237054
<SOS> asked albert in the most sprightly tone . <EOS>	82.37976875903584
<SOS> danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering , and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features , but which was gone in a moment . <EOS>	56.51856204504575
<SOS> `` we shall go together , shall we not ? '' <EOS>	90.5175071419864
<SOS> said albert to the count . <EOS>	72.5473965540965
<SOS> `` if you like , '' replied the latter . <EOS>	101.74129235776316
<SOS> albert could not understand the banker 's look , and turning to monte cristo , who understood it perfectly , `` did you see , '' said he , `` how he looked at me ? '' <EOS>	95.9184613974622
<SOS> `` yes , '' said the count ; `` but did you think there was anything particular in his look ? '' <EOS>	98.4837459992022

<SOS> monte cristo smiled significantly . <EOS>	75.78016400602581
<SOS> `` stop , '' said albert , `` here he comes . <EOS>	103.12726686946651

<SOS> `` my dear viscount , you are dreadfully impertinent . '' <EOS>	96.83103685153097
<SOS> albert advanced towards eugénie , smiling . <EOS>	63.46911529396633
<SOS> meanwhile , danglars , stooping to monte cristo 's ear , `` your advice was excellent , '' said he ; `` there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina . '' <EOS>	98.73946098315334
<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	97.69847128506815

<SOS> the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars ' contempt , monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker 's wife should exercise in providing for the future . <EOS>	112.54587628463169

<SOS> `` let us go in , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	70.49901643768993
<SOS> albert passed his hand through his hair , and curled his moustache , then , having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance , followed the count into the room , the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves . <EOS>	90.65984127473894
<SOS> ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard , and the door was kept by the three french attendants , commanded by myrtho . <EOS>	83.94832118782854
<SOS> haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments , which was the drawing room . <EOS>	74.77398095410823
<SOS> her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation , for it was the first time that any man , except monte cristo , had been accorded an entrance into her presence . <EOS>	64.33511112218645
<SOS> she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room , with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion , and seemed to have made for herself , as it were , a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her . <EOS>	109.01514963832331
<SOS> near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing ; it was elegantly fashioned , and worthy of its mistress . <EOS>	60.081194253532104
<SOS> on perceiving monte cristo , she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself , expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love . <EOS>	79.87759526836177
<SOS> monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand , which she as usual raised to her lips . <EOS>	64.10024674466487
<SOS> < num > m albert had proceeded no farther than the door , where he remained rooted to the spot , being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty , beheld as it was for the first time , and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea . <EOS>	84.085486126344
<SOS> `` whom do you bring ? '' <EOS>	107.91119148858978
<SOS> asked the young girl in romaic , of monte cristo ; `` is it a friend , a brother , a simple acquaintance , or an enemy . '' <EOS>	99.37773302360947
<SOS> `` a friend , '' said monte cristo in the same language . <EOS>	74.52363180837305
<SOS> `` what is his name ? '' <EOS>	59.96340623023053
<SOS> `` count albert ; it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome . '' <EOS>	107.47652866167606
<SOS> `` in what language would you like me to converse with him ? '' <EOS>	80.99086294991854
<SOS> monte cristo turned to albert . <EOS>	65.90708369110318
<SOS> `` do you know modern greek , '' asked he . <EOS>	104.16427270837312
<SOS> `` alas ! <EOS>	96.59102444833582
<SOS> no , '' said albert ; `` nor even ancient greek , my dear count ; never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself . '' <EOS>	71.71809847146366
<SOS> `` then , '' said haydée , proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo 's question and albert 's answer , `` then i will speak either in french or italian , if my lord so wills it . '' <EOS>	108.51040498711383
<SOS> monte cristo reflected one instant . <EOS>	73.77080145457744
<SOS> `` you will speak in italian , '' said he . <EOS>	101.70127431783203
<SOS> then , turning towards albert , `` it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek , both of which haydée speaks so fluently ; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian , which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation . '' <EOS>	81.28583891941979
<SOS> the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor . <EOS>	83.88192623727187
<SOS> `` sir , '' she said to morcerf , `` you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master . '' <EOS>	98.35630712820064
<SOS> this was said in excellent tuscan , and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer . <EOS>	92.53172826992859
<SOS> then , turning to ali , she directed him to bring coffee and pipes , and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her . <EOS>	119.27378250906204
<SOS> monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table , on which were arranged music , drawings , and vases of flowers . <EOS>	114.67939525973257
<SOS> ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques ; as to m. baptistin , this portion of the building was interdicted to him . <EOS>	57.85575471833239
<SOS> albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him . <EOS>	65.6675145482963
<SOS> `` oh , take it take it , '' said the count ; `` haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian ; the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her , but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume , you know . '' <EOS>	108.29958363384868
<SOS> ali left the room . <EOS>	114.02683355046847
<SOS> the cups of coffee were all prepared , with the addition of sugar , which had been brought for albert . <EOS>	62.77449416651942
<SOS> monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner , that is to say , without sugar . <EOS>	87.02993705909859
<SOS> haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes . <EOS>	85.51321964210346
<SOS> at this moment two women entered , bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet , which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose . <EOS>	87.29786390970443
<SOS> `` my dear host , and you , signora , '' said albert , in italian , `` excuse my apparent stupidity . <EOS>	70.81129449755099

<SOS> here i am in the heart of paris ; but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers , and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east ; not such as i have seen it , but such as my dreams have painted it . <EOS>	118.09523593604227
<SOS> oh , signora , if i could but speak greek , your conversation , added to the fairy scene which surrounds me , would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget . '' <EOS>	83.11181298965838
<SOS> `` i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you , sir , '' said haydée quietly ; `` and if you like what is eastern , i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here . '' <EOS>	107.90393620452454
<SOS> `` on what subject shall i converse with her ? '' <EOS>	76.14796051184659

<SOS> `` just what you please ; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences , or if you like it better you can talk of rome , naples , or florence . '' <EOS>	81.12788740099704

<SOS> haydée sighed deeply , and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow . <EOS>	64.58952245028478
<SOS> `` what are you saying to her ? '' <EOS>	59.38689823236417
<SOS> said morcerf in an undertone . <EOS>	92.13369921091059
<SOS> `` i again reminded her that you were a friend , and that she need not conceal anything from you . '' <EOS>	99.29219528091727
<SOS> `` then , '' said albert , `` this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance ; what is the next ? '' <EOS>	110.35950004011646
<SOS> `` oh , then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees , on the borders of a lake , in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror . <EOS>	68.17993255875474
<SOS> under the oldest and thickest of these trees , reclining on cushions , sat my father ; my mother was at his feet , and i , childlike , amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle , or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle . <EOS>	87.39978378499919
<SOS> then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention , but which he always answered in the same tone of voice , either 'kill , ' or 'pardon . ' '' <EOS>	55.1733877405061
<SOS> `` it is very strange , '' said albert , `` to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage , and one needs constantly to be saying to one 's self , 'this is no fiction , it is all reality , ' in order to believe it . <EOS>	105.06240971672055

<SOS> `` i think it is a fine country , '' said haydée , `` but i see france as it really is , because i look on it with the eyes of a woman ; whereas my own country , which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind , always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere , which is luminous or otherwise , according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous . '' <EOS>	92.71166392255732

<SOS> haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo , who , making at the same time some imperceptible sign , murmured : `` εἰπέ speak . '' <EOS>	81.09275197711047

<SOS> `` i beg you to do so , '' replied albert . <EOS>	103.19487844793747
<SOS> `` well , i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother . <EOS>	121.68027928132183
<SOS> we were in the palace of yanina ; she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping , and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears . <EOS>	82.79493272579144
<SOS> she took me away without speaking . <EOS>	83.42592743602842

<SOS> 'hush , child ! ' <EOS>	116.86123649373285
<SOS> said she . <EOS>	64.47461326353898
<SOS> at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats , i had with a child 's caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined ; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother 's voice when she enjoined me to silence , that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given . <EOS>	85.62515864811822
<SOS> she bore me rapidly away . <EOS>	67.50964221484345
<SOS> `` i saw then that we were descending a large staircase ; around us were all my mother 's servants carrying trunks , bags , ornaments , jewels , purses of gold , with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction . <EOS>	87.76692542264064
<SOS> `` behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols , and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation . <EOS>	69.5956727659437

<SOS> here and there on the walls of the staircase , were reflected gigantic shadows , which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above . <EOS>	95.3420398725271
<SOS> `` 'quick ! ' <EOS>	94.30620541374707
<SOS> said a voice at the end of the gallery . <EOS>	85.70190828696639
<SOS> this voice made everyone bow before it , resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat , by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance . <EOS>	98.90506073798629
<SOS> as for me , it made me tremble . <EOS>	88.82240499769982
<SOS> this voice was that of my father . <EOS>	72.46405221415303
<SOS> he came last , clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him . <EOS>	94.0241573623001
<SOS> he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim , and he drove us all before him , as a shepherd would his straggling flock . <EOS>	83.34781500662137
<SOS> my father , '' said haydée , raising her head , `` was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina , and before whom turkey trembled . '' <EOS>	93.95033072254591
<SOS> albert , without knowing why , started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent ; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment ; she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre , as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man , to the news of which all europe had listened with horror . <EOS>	87.271921269018
<SOS> `` soon , '' said haydée , `` we halted on our march , and found ourselves on the borders of a lake . <EOS>	103.61186476214444
<SOS> my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart , and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father , who was glancing anxiously around . <EOS>	79.78533418581404

<SOS> this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance , perhaps on account of the darkness of the night , which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned . <EOS>	115.03886352341951
<SOS> we stepped into the boat . <EOS>	100.69341097587707
<SOS> i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water , and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares. < num > besides the rowers , the boat contained only the women , my father , mother , selim , and myself . <EOS>	68.84329052763428
<SOS> the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake , ready to cover our retreat ; they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps , and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others , in case of pursuit . <EOS>	69.0507095041934
<SOS> our bark flew before the wind . <EOS>	68.91159648801128

<SOS> he , the all powerful he , before whom others were accustomed to fly he , who had taken for his device , 'they hate me ; then they fear me ! ' <EOS>	105.55956382004064
<SOS> `` it was , indeed , a flight which my father was trying to effect . <EOS>	102.74912567734944
<SOS> i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina , fatigued with long service `` here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo , whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative . <EOS>	113.24633341719053
<SOS> the young girl then continued , speaking slowly , like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating . <EOS>	87.41941626142258
<SOS> `` you were saying , signora , '' said albert , who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital , `` that the garrison of yanina , fatigued with long service `` `` had treated with the seraskier < num > kourchid , who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father ; it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself , and which he called kataphygion , or the refuge . '' <EOS>	87.04446442405064
<SOS> `` and this officer , '' asked albert , `` do you remember his name , signora ? '' <EOS>	75.4453128821194
<SOS> monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl , which was quite unperceived by albert . <EOS>	98.56080462200882
<SOS> `` no , '' said she , `` i do not remember it just at this moment ; but if it should occur to me presently , i will tell you . '' <EOS>	88.28036548467543
<SOS> albert was on the point of pronouncing his father 's name , when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach ; the young man recollected his promise , and was silent . <EOS>	74.33162297043951
<SOS> `` it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing . <EOS>	78.30212898180974
<SOS> a ground floor , ornamented with arabesques , bathing its terraces in the water , and another floor , looking on the lake , was all which was visible to the eye . <EOS>	74.2262337785022
<SOS> but beneath the ground floor , stretching out into the island , was a large subterranean cavern , to which my mother , myself , and the women were conducted . <EOS>	86.23349025099829

<SOS> i remember well that the slaves , convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives , passed whole days and nights in praying , crying , and groaning . <EOS>	68.93487052114172

<SOS> i can not tell you how long we remained in this state ; at that period i did not even know what time meant . <EOS>	79.60731719752779
<SOS> sometimes , but very rarely , my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace ; these were hours of recreation for me , as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim 's fiery lance . <EOS>	78.83588469825071
<SOS> my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon , examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake , while my mother , reclining by his side , rested her head on his shoulder , and i played at his feet , admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves , but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance . <EOS>	86.02111374605997
<SOS> the heights of pindus towered above us ; the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake , and the immense masses of black vegetation which , viewed in the distance , gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks , were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles . <EOS>	69.89961578908809

<SOS> albert had often heard not from his father , for he never spoke on the subject , but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina ; he had read different accounts of his death , but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl , and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him . <EOS>	114.77541805934781
<SOS> as to haydée , these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment , for she ceased speaking , her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm ; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina , which , like a magic mirror , seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched . <EOS>	66.01220691520604

<SOS> cried selim . <EOS>	64.67281177466877
<SOS> 'but whoever you may be , i charge you not to advance another step . ' <EOS>	74.013347105186
<SOS> 'long live the emperor ! ' <EOS>	74.80488427069506
<SOS> said the figure . <EOS>	77.47609227073104
<SOS> 'he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali , and not only gives him his life , but restores to him his fortune and his possessions . ' <EOS>	117.61587346214921
<SOS> my mother uttered a cry of joy , and clasped me to her bosom . <EOS>	86.50527360925432
<SOS> 'stop , ' said selim , seeing that she was about to go out ; 'you see i have not yet received the ring , ' 'true , ' said my mother . <EOS>	73.19022449902748
<SOS> and she fell on her knees , at the same time holding me up towards heaven , as if she desired , while praying to god in my behalf , to raise me actually to his presence . '' <EOS>	95.09227324986637
<SOS> and for the second time haydée stopped , overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow , and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance , so parched and dry were her throat and lips . <EOS>	54.87064653089173
<SOS> < num > m monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass , and presented it to her , saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command , `` courage . '' <EOS>	112.41705548836146
<SOS> haydée dried her eyes , and continued : `` by this time our eyes , habituated to the darkness , had recognized the messenger of the pasha , it was a friend . <EOS>	91.85295682729671
<SOS> selim had also recognized him , but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty , which was to obey . <EOS>	90.6531290925222
<SOS> 'in whose name do you come ? ' <EOS>	102.26305948195106
<SOS> said he to him . <EOS>	91.87990019107797
<SOS> ' i come in the name of our master , ali tepelini . ' <EOS>	67.98570681875017
<SOS> 'if you come from ali himself , ' said selim , 'you know what you were charged to remit to me ? ' <EOS>	120.39544751872351
<SOS> 'yes , ' said the messenger , 'and i bring you his ring . ' <EOS>	85.2057338647745
<SOS> at these words he raised his hand above his head , to show the token ; but it was too far off , and there was not light enough to enable selim , where he was standing , to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view . <EOS>	114.3234624733275
<SOS> ' i do not see what you have in your hand , ' said selim . <EOS>	98.0345509334484
<SOS> 'approach then , ' said the messenger , 'or i will come nearer to you , if you prefer it . ' <EOS>	80.6447301818807
<SOS> ' i will agree to neither one nor the other , ' replied the young soldier ; 'place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there , and retire while i examine it . ' <EOS>	66.57002109304317
<SOS> 'be it so , ' said the envoy ; and he retired , after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim . <EOS>	87.19104183175034
<SOS> `` oh , how our hearts palpitated ; for it did , indeed , seem to be a ring which was placed there . <EOS>	82.14060068048312
<SOS> but was it my father 's ring ? <EOS>	109.45464399582723
<SOS> that was the question . <EOS>	111.83141135600336
<SOS> selim , still holding in his hand the lighted match , walked towards the opening in the cavern , and , aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave , picked up the token . <EOS>	74.5597270242883
<SOS> `` 'it is well , ' said he , kissing it ; 'it is my master 's ring ! ' <EOS>	64.45079080368689
<SOS> and throwing the match on the ground , he trampled on it and extinguished it . <EOS>	56.00587403227177
<SOS> the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands . <EOS>	67.06909925153339
<SOS> at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared , and selim fell , pierced by five blows . <EOS>	104.18165146985699
<SOS> each man had stabbed him separately , and , intoxicated by their crime , though still pale with fear , they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire , after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold . <EOS>	82.53576595279398
<SOS> at this moment my mother seized me in her arms , and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves , she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk , where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion . <EOS>	80.91032008789607
<SOS> the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid 's troops ; that is to say , with our enemies . <EOS>	62.47840385748657
<SOS> just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door , we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone . <EOS>	85.40372385223505
<SOS> my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards ; i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within . <EOS>	97.74346208989742
<SOS> 'what do you want ? ' <EOS>	103.97519402361962
<SOS> said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold . <EOS>	119.75276665552883
<SOS> 'what we want , ' replied one , 'is to communicate to you the will of his highness . <EOS>	79.70968740623809
<SOS> do you see this firman ? ' <EOS>	114.60704620251398
<SOS> ' i do , ' said my father . <EOS>	62.25754688548846
<SOS> 'well , read it ; he demands your head . ' <EOS>	95.637567451542
<SOS> < num > m `` my father answered with a loud laugh , which was more frightful than even threats would have been , and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard ; he had fired them himself , and had killed two men . <EOS>	76.95505421684499
<SOS> the palikares , who were prostrated at my father 's feet , now sprang up and fired , and the room was filled with fire and smoke . <EOS>	86.110734883107
<SOS> at the same instant the firing began on the other side , and the balls penetrated the boards all round us . <EOS>	64.2985495472602
<SOS> oh , how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment , in the midst of the flying bullets , his scimitar in his hand , and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies ! <EOS>	69.81897616583196
<SOS> and how he terrified them , even then , and made them fly before him ! <EOS>	101.65884807495517
<SOS> 'selim , selim ! ' <EOS>	84.6847810251512
<SOS> cried he , 'guardian of the fire , do your duty ! ' <EOS>	92.00467678677101
<SOS> 'selim is dead , ' replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth , 'and you are lost , ali ! ' <EOS>	88.90819193705464
<SOS> at the same moment an explosion was heard , and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath . <EOS>	82.93624669030405
<SOS> three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds . <EOS>	97.50270981554795
<SOS> `` my father howled aloud , plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made , and tore up one of the planks entire . <EOS>	75.49940525713342
<SOS> but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired , and the flame , rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano , soon reached the tapestry , which it quickly devoured . <EOS>	87.74412087337255
<SOS> in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries , two reports , fearfully distinct , followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all , froze me with terror . <EOS>	68.87773370531045
<SOS> these two shots had mortally wounded my father , and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries . <EOS>	70.84953775290298
<SOS> however , he remained standing , clinging to a window . <EOS>	69.58744807153103
<SOS> my mother tried to force the door , that she might go and die with him , but it was fastened on the inside . <EOS>	88.3293123907709
<SOS> all around him were lying the palikares , writhing in convulsive agonies , while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows . <EOS>	77.50298450503192
<SOS> at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way , my father fell on one knee , and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth , armed with sabres , pistols , and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man , and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons , and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet . <EOS>	64.92788405603004
<SOS> i felt myself fall to the ground , my mother had fainted . '' <EOS>	85.8286689197816
<SOS> haydée 's arms fell by her side , and she uttered a deep groan , at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands . <EOS>	94.79588299550018
<SOS> monte cristo arose and approached her , took her hand , and said to her in romaic : `` calm yourself , my dear child , and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors . '' <EOS>	94.60836693964785
<SOS> `` it is a frightful story , count , '' said albert , terrified at the paleness of haydée 's countenance , `` and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request . '' <EOS>	85.43438668643084
<SOS> `` oh , it is nothing , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	92.87096698522595
<SOS> then , patting the young girl on the head , he continued , `` haydée is very courageous , and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes . '' <EOS>	98.61675984310057
<SOS> `` because , my lord , '' said haydée eagerly , `` my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness . '' <EOS>	97.38557444059283
<SOS> albert looked at her with curiosity , for she had not yet related what he most desired to know , how she had become the slave of the count . <EOS>	85.38190648371368
<SOS> haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors ; she continued : `` when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier . <EOS>	76.11074398382769
<SOS> 'kill , ' said she , 'but spare the honor of the widow of ali . ' <EOS>	74.85084076564944
<SOS> 'it is not to me to whom you must address yourself , ' said kourchid . <EOS>	78.97721975722258
<SOS> `` 'to whom , then ? ' <EOS>	88.70578387686167

<SOS> 'he is here . ' <EOS>	81.17341995737705
<SOS> `` and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father , '' said haydée , in a tone of chastened anger . <EOS>	117.75028537486607
<SOS> `` then , '' said albert , `` you became the property of this man ? '' <EOS>	102.07926432456121
<SOS> < num > m `` no , '' replied haydée , `` he did not dare to keep us , so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople . <EOS>	75.63955554586664
<SOS> we traversed greece , and arrived half dead at the imperial gates . <EOS>	90.43470580218292
<SOS> they were surrounded by a crowd of people , who opened a way for us to pass , when suddenly my mother , having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention , uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground , pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates , and beneath which were inscribed these words : ' this is the head of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina . ' <EOS>	75.89248335243444
<SOS> `` i cried bitterly , and tried to raise my mother from the earth , but she was dead ! <EOS>	70.66447542490332

<SOS> he caused me to be instructed , gave me masters , and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud . '' <EOS>	56.171695131652
<SOS> `` of whom i bought her , '' said monte cristo , `` as i told you , albert , with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills . '' <EOS>	107.18825516914833
<SOS> `` oh , you are good , you are great , my lord ! '' <EOS>	108.32033883515534
<SOS> said haydée , kissing the count 's hand , `` and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master ! '' <EOS>	74.5110423711445
<SOS> albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard . <EOS>	110.35617868195219
<SOS> `` come , finish your cup of coffee , '' said monte cristo ; `` the history is ended . '' <EOS>	104.16986596094314
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	123.02100817541807
<SOS> we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m. noirtier , even she would have been constrained to pity him . <EOS>	63.629571247748
<SOS> villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences , and then retired to his study , where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter : `` after all the disclosures which were made this morning , m. noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m. franz d'épinay . <EOS>	69.58754514874931
<SOS> m. d'épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m. de villefort , who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning , should not have anticipated him in this announcement . '' <EOS>	84.23578825486129
<SOS> no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment , so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances , would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance ; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor , or rather rudeness , so far as to relate such a history . <EOS>	90.74067045206243
<SOS> and in justice to villefort , it must be understood that m. noirtier , who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject , had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort , so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel , or the baron d'épinay , as he was alternately styled , according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name , or by the title which had been conferred on him , fell the victim of assassination , and not that he was killed fairly in a duel . <EOS>	116.51281456642465
<SOS> this harsh letter , coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful , struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort . <EOS>	106.59869818644253
<SOS> hardly had he read the letter , when his wife entered . <EOS>	91.91118446055461
<SOS> the sudden departure of franz , after being summoned by m. noirtier , had so much astonished everyone , that the position of madame de villefort , left alone with the notary and the witnesses , became every moment more embarrassing . <EOS>	84.87077450908177
<SOS> determined to bear it no longer , she arose and left the room ; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance . <EOS>	104.05708301493083
<SOS> m. de villefort 's communications on the subject were very limited and concise ; he told her , in fact , that an explanation had taken place between m. noirtier , m. d'épinay , and himself , and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off . <EOS>	95.7819811331465
<SOS> this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting . <EOS>	95.98587616913059
<SOS> she therefore contented herself with saying that m. noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit , the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer . <EOS>	68.81225407447958
<SOS> this news , false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred , evidently astonished the auditors , and they retired without a word . <EOS>	79.58275353009284
<SOS> during this time valentine , at once terrified and happy , after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable , asked leave to retire to her own room , in order to recover her composure . <EOS>	87.05981468569809
<SOS> noirtier looked the permission which she solicited . <EOS>	94.31726036069122
<SOS> but instead of going to her own room , valentine , having once gained her liberty , entered the gallery , and , opening a small door at the end of it , found herself at once in the garden . <EOS>	79.45020977294736
<SOS> in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other , an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine 's mind . <EOS>	81.48379484145636
<SOS> she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear , pale and trembling , to forbid the signing of the contract , like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor . <EOS>	89.97744993960876
<SOS> it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate , for maximilian had long awaited her coming . <EOS>	85.9242692067237
<SOS> he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m. de villefort . <EOS>	81.97784609218085
<SOS> he followed m. d'épinay , saw him enter , afterwards go out , and then re enter with albert and château renaud . <EOS>	77.48960258584866
<SOS> he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference ; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch , prepared to hear the result of the proceedings , and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty . <EOS>	95.78857231625976
<SOS> he was not mistaken ; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition , he soon discovered the young girl , who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier . <EOS>	77.3247061065662
<SOS> the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him , and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight . <EOS>	83.3110258372815
<SOS> `` we are saved ! '' <EOS>	103.76588913305666
<SOS> said valentine . <EOS>	101.01371377306235
<SOS> `` saved ? '' <EOS>	65.13426811586291
<SOS> repeated morrel , not being able to conceive such intense happiness ; `` by whom ? '' <EOS>	86.89868878526241
<SOS> `` by my grandfather . <EOS>	83.4240577703102
<SOS> oh , morrel , pray love him for all his goodness to us ! '' <EOS>	70.76968307855796
<SOS> morrel swore to love him with all his soul ; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so , for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father , he worshiped him as a god . <EOS>	88.58484202665524
<SOS> `` but tell me , valentine , how has it all been effected ? <EOS>	100.45700001538772
<SOS> what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end ? '' <EOS>	94.83848455276568
<SOS> valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed , but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather , and she said : `` at some future time i will tell you all about it . '' <EOS>	108.56819196916068
<SOS> `` but when will that be ? '' <EOS>	95.86365461222907
<SOS> `` when i am your wife . '' <EOS>	111.79863668577595
<SOS> the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel , that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose , and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day . <EOS>	65.4567777471207
<SOS> however , he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night . <EOS>	89.47395181285496
<SOS> valentine promised all that morrel required of her , and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz . <EOS>	114.29832200508918
<SOS> during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed , madame de villefort had gone to visit m. noirtier . <EOS>	87.53852242573159
<SOS> the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her . <EOS>	102.55918964228702
<SOS> `` sir , '' said she , `` it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine 's marriage is broken off , since it was here that the affair was concluded . '' <EOS>	91.50835045457798
<SOS> noirtier 's countenance remained immovable . <EOS>	112.69783131649532
<SOS> `` but one thing i can tell you , of which i do not think you are aware ; that is , that i have always been opposed to this marriage , and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation . '' <EOS>	76.46990525521288
<SOS> noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation . <EOS>	112.01234839936573
<SOS> `` now that this marriage , which i know you so much disliked , is done away with , i come to you on an errand which neither m. de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake . '' <EOS>	62.69133966304403
<SOS> noirtier 's eyes demanded the nature of her mission . <EOS>	96.91251637385439
<SOS> `` i come to entreat you , sir , '' continued madame de villefort , `` as the only one who has the right of doing so , inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction , i come to entreat you to restore , not your love , for that she has always possessed , but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter . '' <EOS>	70.21732251787566
<SOS> there was a doubtful expression in noirtier 's eyes ; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding , and he could not succeed in doing so . <EOS>	70.4792310530126
<SOS> `` may i hope , sir , '' said madame de villefort , `` that your intentions accord with my request ? '' <EOS>	106.72152645073032
<SOS> noirtier made a sign that they did . <EOS>	77.67672875846819
<SOS> `` in that case , sir , '' rejoined madame de villefort , `` i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes . '' <EOS>	75.818567445842
<SOS> she then bowed to m. noirtier and retired . <EOS>	104.77409580962807
<SOS> the next day m. noirtier sent for the notary ; the first will was torn up and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine , on condition that she should never be separated from him . <EOS>	86.21404958156121
<SOS> it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort , the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint méran , had regained the good graces of her grandfather , and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of < num > , < num > livres . <EOS>	60.84738137525427
<SOS> while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house of m. de villefort , monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf , who , in order to lose no time in responding to m. danglars ' wishes , and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society , donned his uniform of lieutenant general , which he ornamented with all his crosses , and thus attired , ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d'antin . <EOS>	115.68960451559735
<SOS> danglars was balancing his monthly accounts , and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor . <EOS>	115.82102083581755
<SOS> at the first sight of his old friend , danglars assumed his majestic air , and settled himself in his easy chair . <EOS>	84.0468412787552
<SOS> morcerf , usually so stiff and formal , accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner , and , feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received , he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end , but went at once straight to the point . <EOS>	61.56405611534332
<SOS> < num > m `` well , baron , '' said he , `` here i am at last ; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed , and they are not yet executed . '' <EOS>	98.69320123737585
<SOS> morcerf paused at these words , quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars , and which he attributed to his silence ; but , on the contrary , to his great surprise , it grew darker and darker . <EOS>	77.1858965804328
<SOS> `` to what do you allude , monsieur ? '' <EOS>	79.59360458430687
<SOS> said danglars ; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general 's words . <EOS>	83.84308535601355
<SOS> `` ah , '' said morcerf , `` i see you are a stickler for forms , my dear sir , and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted . <EOS>	56.25254534810204
<SOS> ma foi , i beg your pardon , but as i have but one son , and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him , i am still serving my apprenticeship , you know ; come , i will reform . '' <EOS>	62.21419995753474
<SOS> and morcerf with a forced smile arose , and , making a low bow to m. danglars , said : `` baron , i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son , the vicomte albert de morcerf . '' <EOS>	78.58000254593229
<SOS> but danglars , instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected , knit his brow , and without inviting the count , who was still standing , to take a seat , he said : `` monsieur , it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer . '' <EOS>	83.9309771301978
<SOS> `` to reflect ? '' <EOS>	89.89738046602301
<SOS> said morcerf , more and more astonished ; `` have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us ? '' <EOS>	81.22922362814143
<SOS> `` count , '' said the banker , `` things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions , or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances , which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them . '' <EOS>	115.07890727345757
<SOS> `` i do not understand you , baron , '' said morcerf . <EOS>	100.20277649506671
<SOS> `` what i mean to say is this , sir , that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred `` `` excuse me , '' said morcerf , `` but is it a play we are acting ? '' <EOS>	78.85384296827313
<SOS> `` a play ? '' <EOS>	91.88819042965491
<SOS> `` yes , for it is like one ; pray let us come more to the point , and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other . '' <EOS>	86.68080998518201
<SOS> `` that is quite my desire . '' <EOS>	98.30497334729465
<SOS> `` you have seen m. de monte cristo have you not ? '' <EOS>	75.96207429543567
<SOS> `` i see him very often , '' said danglars , drawing himself up ; `` he is a particular friend of mine . '' <EOS>	76.10790765495899
<SOS> `` well , in one of your late conversations with him , you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage , did you not ? '' <EOS>	73.04176783251599
<SOS> `` i did say so . '' <EOS>	96.38118822632137
<SOS> `` well , here i am , proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other , by entreating you to keep your promise on that score . '' <EOS>	104.74151049210307
<SOS> danglars did not answer . <EOS>	63.65214327008156
<SOS> `` have you so soon changed your mind , '' added morcerf , `` or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled ? '' <EOS>	89.09751775947743
<SOS> danglars , seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it , the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage , turned to morcerf , and said : `` count , you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve , and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you ; but , believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me . '' <EOS>	101.5888548144411
<SOS> `` these are all so many empty words , my dear sir , '' said morcerf : `` they might satisfy a new acquaintance , but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list ; and when a man like him comes to another , recalls to him his plighted word , and this man fails to redeem the pledge , he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing . '' <EOS>	100.6501221112196
<SOS> danglars was a coward , but did not wish to appear so ; he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed . <EOS>	77.41661801708564
<SOS> `` i am not without a good reason for my conduct , '' replied the banker . <EOS>	88.44851819979566
<SOS> `` what do you mean to say ? '' <EOS>	87.14053136162342
<SOS> `` i mean to say that i have a good reason , but that it is difficult to explain . '' <EOS>	68.51465685209396
<SOS> `` you must be aware , at all events , that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me ; but one thing at least is clear , which is , that you decline allying yourself with my family . '' <EOS>	82.119154895375
<SOS> `` no , sir , '' said danglars ; `` i merely suspend my decision , that is all . '' <EOS>	70.36878873104311
<SOS> `` and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices , and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces ? '' <EOS>	104.37994518321969
<SOS> `` then , count , if you will not wait , we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained . '' <EOS>	76.24006164180948
<SOS> the count bit his lips till the blood almost started , to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain ; understanding , however , that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him , he turned from the door , towards which he had been directing his steps , and again confronted the banker . <EOS>	110.06151307316983
<SOS> a cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there . <EOS>	84.45906488787473
<SOS> `` my dear danglars , '' said morcerf , `` we have been acquainted for many years , and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other 's failings . <EOS>	69.65290648224365
<SOS> you owe me an explanation , and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor . '' <EOS>	94.13235890701495
<SOS> `` it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount , that is all i can say , sir , '' replied danglars , who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down . <EOS>	106.95073308004793
<SOS> `` and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling , then ? '' <EOS>	75.00377151962294
<SOS> said morcerf , turning pale with anger . <EOS>	72.40941498527086
<SOS> the expression of the count 's face had not remained unperceived by the banker ; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before , and said : `` you may , perhaps , be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars . '' <EOS>	65.48236050670225
<SOS> a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count , and making a violent effort over himself , he said : `` i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation . <EOS>	105.02043678599318
<SOS> is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you ? <EOS>	99.8222918941014
<SOS> is it my fortune which you find insufficient ? <EOS>	78.89620200516926
<SOS> is it because my opinions differ from yours ? '' <EOS>	95.26074613971647
<SOS> `` nothing of the kind , sir , '' replied danglars : `` if such had been the case , i only should have been to blame , inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement . <EOS>	70.68709140445118
<SOS> no , do not seek any longer to discover the reason . <EOS>	97.98751250671108
<SOS> i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination ; let us drop the subject , and adopt the middle course of delay , which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement . <EOS>	85.72338007345832
<SOS> ma foi , there is no hurry . <EOS>	65.57564288726621
<SOS> my daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son twenty one . <EOS>	86.0308936670446
<SOS> while we wait , time will be progressing , events will succeed each other ; things which in the evening look dark and obscure , appear but too clearly in the light of morning , and sometimes the utterance of one word , or the lapse of a single day , will reveal the most cruel calumnies . '' <EOS>	58.36952411343808
<SOS> `` calumnies , did you say , sir ? '' <EOS>	98.851413034869
<SOS> cried morcerf , turning livid with rage . <EOS>	71.9334934601546
<SOS> `` does anyone dare to slander me ? '' <EOS>	72.18517418583667
<SOS> `` monsieur , i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation . '' <EOS>	105.31352435475748
<SOS> `` then , sir , i am patiently to submit to your refusal ? '' <EOS>	64.37737156584146
<SOS> `` yes , sir , although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive , for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance , and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman . '' <EOS>	100.33048015299423
<SOS> `` enough , sir , '' said morcerf , `` we will speak no more on the subject . '' <EOS>	111.52088530035228
<SOS> and clutching his gloves in anger , he left the apartment . <EOS>	67.37620795490996
<SOS> danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word . <EOS>	84.75196715071509
<SOS> that evening he had a long conference with several friends ; and m. cavalcanti , who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies , was the last to leave the banker 's house . <EOS>	95.24827979133825
<SOS> the next morning , as soon as he awoke , danglars asked for the newspapers ; they were brought to him ; he laid aside three or four , and at last fixed on l'impartial , the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor . <EOS>	70.85691300903999
<SOS> he hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the paris jottings , and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina . <EOS>	106.63290875371509
<SOS> `` very good , '' observed danglars , after having read the paragraph ; `` here is a little article on colonel fernand , which , if i am not mistaken , would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary . '' <EOS>	88.80262390153494
<SOS> at the same moment , that is , at nine o'clock in the morning , albert de morcerf , dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin , might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo 's house in the champs élysées . <EOS>	97.76535525923491
<SOS> when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously . <EOS>	89.09125047896568
<SOS> `` did he take baptistin with him ? '' <EOS>	84.9672719947048
<SOS> `` no , my lord . '' <EOS>	75.55655207232009
<SOS> `` call him , then ; i wish to speak to him . '' <EOS>	108.32815832228705
<SOS> the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre , and returned with him in an instant . <EOS>	84.81479468101924
<SOS> `` my good friend , '' said albert , `` i beg pardon for my intrusion , but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not . '' <EOS>	95.11524248648911
<SOS> `` he is really out , sir , '' replied baptistin . <EOS>	82.61642444541607
<SOS> `` out , even to me ? '' <EOS>	87.54228622714896
<SOS> `` i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte , '' said baptistin ; `` and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order . '' <EOS>	85.09402107084149
<SOS> `` you are right ; and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance . <EOS>	74.90182546396794
<SOS> do you think it will be long before he comes in ? '' <EOS>	117.84607615615458
<SOS> `` no , i think not , for he ordered his breakfast at ten o'clock . '' <EOS>	72.93168757193013
<SOS> `` well , i will go and take a turn in the champs élysées , and at ten o'clock i will return here ; meanwhile , if the count should come in , will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me ? '' <EOS>	114.31718828258442
<SOS> `` you may depend on my doing so , sir , '' said baptistin . <EOS>	84.30822867780782
<SOS> albert left the cab in which he had come at the count 's door , intending to take a turn on foot . <EOS>	98.79139146738618
<SOS> as he was passing the allée des veuves , he thought he saw the count 's horses standing at gosset 's shooting gallery ; he approached , and soon recognized the coachman . <EOS>	86.11961740935942
<SOS> `` is the count shooting in the gallery ? '' <EOS>	75.37033763391541
<SOS> said morcerf . <EOS>	64.74759716529441
<SOS> `` yes , sir , '' replied the coachman . <EOS>	72.91901363666115
<SOS> while he was speaking , albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots . <EOS>	85.05745546823312
<SOS> he entered , and on his way met the waiter . <EOS>	73.33702096429741
<SOS> `` excuse me , my lord , '' said the lad ; `` but will you have the kindness to wait a moment ? '' <EOS>	81.25605562614136
<SOS> `` what for , philip ? '' <EOS>	71.97723474668695
<SOS> asked albert , who , being a constant visitor there , did not understand this opposition to his entrance . <EOS>	93.43487463830076
<SOS> `` because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone , and never practices in the presence of anyone . '' <EOS>	105.38407813209669
<SOS> `` not even before you , philip ? <EOS>	98.26116485992155
<SOS> then who loads his pistol ? '' <EOS>	89.43146064450227
<SOS> `` his servant . '' <EOS>	76.97328856583651
<SOS> `` a nubian ? '' <EOS>	91.0197851938644
<SOS> `` a negro . '' <EOS>	80.86660308528946
<SOS> `` it is he , then . '' <EOS>	74.05252744088703
<SOS> `` do you know this gentleman ? '' <EOS>	102.30944552202266
<SOS> `` yes , and i am come to look for him ; he is a friend of mine . '' <EOS>	54.94993120503009
<SOS> `` oh , that is quite another thing , then . <EOS>	75.66333266529833
<SOS> i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival . '' <EOS>	82.64304234978815
<SOS> and philip , urged by his own curiosity , entered the gallery ; a second afterwards , monte cristo appeared on the threshold . <EOS>	77.4676511868822
<SOS> `` i ask your pardon , my dear count , '' said albert , `` for following you here , and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so ; i alone am to blame for the indiscretion . <EOS>	97.75308555869825
<SOS> i went to your house , and they told me you were out , but that they expected you home at ten o'clock to breakfast . <EOS>	110.83075195852224
<SOS> i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o'clock , when i caught sight of your carriage and horses . '' <EOS>	70.05610600190917
<SOS> `` what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me . '' <EOS>	94.55302684887128
<SOS> < num > m `` no , thank you , i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now ; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company . '' <EOS>	69.25570596429189
<SOS> `` what on earth are you talking of ? '' <EOS>	60.1813743137399
<SOS> `` i am to fight today . '' <EOS>	84.92572076182479
<SOS> `` for what ? '' <EOS>	99.73818572597156
<SOS> `` for the sake of fighting ! '' <EOS>	66.08219665094644
<SOS> `` yes , i understand that , but what is the quarrel ? <EOS>	90.5460157487404

<SOS> `` i fight in the cause of honor . '' <EOS>	112.46480580247926
<SOS> `` ah , that is something serious . '' <EOS>	96.95941610665024
<SOS> `` so serious , that i come to beg you to render me a service . '' <EOS>	69.83725544390064
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	109.30191018551307
<SOS> `` to be my second . '' <EOS>	63.021192533009255
<SOS> `` that is a serious matter , and we will not discuss it here ; let us speak of nothing till we get home . <EOS>	83.25655778319275
<SOS> ali , bring me some water . '' <EOS>	99.95219898313451
<SOS> the count turned up his sleeves , and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting . <EOS>	78.81445626348945
<SOS> `` come in , my lord , '' said philip in a low tone , `` and i will show you something droll . '' <EOS>	78.03088754192576
<SOS> morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall . <EOS>	85.53502855334018
<SOS> at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit , for he counted from the ace to the ten . <EOS>	95.91280798827987
<SOS> `` ah , ha , '' said albert , `` i see you were preparing for a game of cards . '' <EOS>	85.32003566976256
<SOS> `` no , '' said the count , `` i was making a suit . '' <EOS>	83.05883704468111
<SOS> `` how ? '' <EOS>	63.30993715785794
<SOS> said albert . <EOS>	104.06365839609262
<SOS> `` those are really aces and twos which you see , but my shots have turned them into threes , fives , sevens , eights , nines , and tens . '' <EOS>	84.52818198657373
<SOS> albert approached . <EOS>	75.4503384394548
<SOS> in fact , the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied , the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil . <EOS>	79.68440538209362
<SOS> in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count 's pistol. `` <EOS>	62.89797855443392
<SOS> diable ! `` <EOS>	96.83212858250677

<SOS> `` what would you have , my dear viscount ? '' <EOS>	102.97332503770718
<SOS> said monte cristo , wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him ; `` i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other . <EOS>	90.98805373578914
<SOS> but come , i am waiting for you . '' <EOS>	83.82922774641533

<SOS> `` now let us talk the matter over quietly , '' said the count . <EOS>	62.102206416057

<SOS> `` well , let it be three weeks then , '' said morcerf ; `` but remember , at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in `` `` m. albert de morcerf , '' said beauchamp , rising in his turn , `` i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say , for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed . <EOS>	86.40723317984377

'' <EOS>	79.20709956278019
<SOS> when he had concluded his speech , beauchamp bowed coldly to albert , turned his back upon him , and went to the press room . <EOS>	115.9959094730222
<SOS> albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers , which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick ; after which ebullition he departed not , however , without walking several times to the door of the press room , as if he had half a mind to enter . <EOS>	72.95435747325463
<SOS> < num > m while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture , as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel , who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye . <EOS>	60.901201172396036
<SOS> he was passing the chinese baths , and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin , and to be going towards the madeleine . <EOS>	85.07579122792434
<SOS> `` ah , '' said morcerf , `` there goes a happy man ! '' <EOS>	82.53258282961444
<SOS> and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion . <EOS>	86.98239523328878
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	74.89267608931047
<SOS> the lemonade morrel was , in fact , very happy . <EOS>	93.00561549425137
<SOS> m. noirtier had just sent for him , and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab , placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse . <EOS>	77.0085308625657
<SOS> he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay , and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honoré . <EOS>	85.25595715839138
<SOS> morrel advanced with a firm , manly tread , and poor barrois followed him as he best might . <EOS>	87.89996975390694
<SOS> morrel was only thirty one , barrois was sixty years of age ; morrel was deeply in love , and barrois was dying with heat and exertion . <EOS>	84.7503049513713
<SOS> these two men , thus opposed in age and interests , resembled two parts of a triangle , presenting the extremes of separation , yet nevertheless possessing their point of union . <EOS>	71.48678646008929
<SOS> this point of union was noirtier , and it was he who had just sent for morrel , with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter , to the great discomfiture of barrois . <EOS>	87.79696272942155
<SOS> on arriving at the house , morrel was not even out of breath , for love lends wings to our desires ; but barrois , who had long forgotten what it was to love , was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use . <EOS>	99.14084487390485
<SOS> the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance , closed the door of the study , and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine . <EOS>	92.61635262837142
<SOS> she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress , and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather . <EOS>	66.22343386097127
<SOS> but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor , and he soon made his appearance in the room . <EOS>	89.63336188838295
<SOS> noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair . <EOS>	84.75982517851087
<SOS> morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him . <EOS>	75.56949899380588
<SOS> valentine was sitting at a little distance from them , timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak . <EOS>	70.34660427282931
<SOS> noirtier fixed his eyes on her . <EOS>	74.62875153263674
<SOS> `` am i to say what you told me ? '' <EOS>	104.04326569909448
<SOS> asked valentine . <EOS>	103.7809535371015
<SOS> noirtier made a sign that she was to do so . <EOS>	67.13073151941123
<SOS> `` monsieur morrel , '' said valentine to the young man , who was regarding her with the most intense interest , `` my grandfather , m. noirtier , had a thousand things to say , which he told me three days ago ; and now , he has sent for you , that i may repeat them to you . <EOS>	88.72583022112472
<SOS> i will repeat them , then ; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter , i will be faithful to the trust , and will not alter a word of his intentions . '' <EOS>	114.6723351069023
<SOS> `` oh , i am listening with the greatest impatience , '' replied the young man ; `` speak , i beg of you . '' <EOS>	84.64289399179448
<SOS> valentine cast down her eyes ; this was a good omen for morrel , for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine . <EOS>	63.19427161600461
<SOS> `` my grandfather intends leaving this house , '' said she , `` and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another . '' <EOS>	106.96139420493668
<SOS> `` but you , mademoiselle de villefort , you , who are necessary to m. noirtier 's happiness `` `` i ? '' <EOS>	66.84149510238584
<SOS> interrupted valentine ; `` i shall not leave my grandfather , that is an understood thing between us . <EOS>	83.36587240417244
<SOS> my apartment will be close to his . <EOS>	116.27398788837435
<SOS> now , m. de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal ; in the first case , i shall leave directly , and in the second , i shall wait till i am of age , which will be in about ten months . <EOS>	85.78661952626821
<SOS> then i shall be free , i shall have an independent fortune , and '' `` and what ? '' <EOS>	97.85520186365572
<SOS> demanded morrel . <EOS>	70.4460514369422
<SOS> `` and with my grandfather 's consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you . '' <EOS>	79.50871655556143
<SOS> valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone , that nothing but morrel 's intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them . <EOS>	78.13860216631124
<SOS> `` have i not explained your wishes , grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	74.2532225350077
<SOS> said valentine , addressing noirtier . <EOS>	85.94904396469533
<SOS> `` yes , '' looked the old man . <EOS>	85.88332746637394
<SOS> `` once under my grandfather 's roof , m. morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector , if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness ; in that case i shall expect m. morrel to come and claim me at my own hands . <EOS>	65.97214515793956
<SOS> but , alas , i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security ; i trust we shall never find it so in our experience ! '' <EOS>	93.09009348720926
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried morrel , almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine , and to adore them as two superior beings , `` what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness ? '' <EOS>	101.9860983249438
<SOS> `` until that time , '' continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice , `` we will conform to circumstances , and be guided by the wishes of our friends , so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us ; in a word , and i repeat it , because it expresses all i wish to convey , we will wait . '' <EOS>	69.64606086628267
<SOS> `` and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes , sir , '' said morrel , `` not only with resignation , but with cheerfulness . '' <EOS>	85.18887576943224
<SOS> `` therefore , '' continued valentine , looking playfully at maximilian , `` no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects ; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined , honorably and happily , to bear your name ? '' <EOS>	112.17239852421169
<SOS> morrel looked obedience to her commands . <EOS>	100.81180959667613
<SOS> noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness , while barrois , who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed , smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead . <EOS>	71.65338679442459
<SOS> `` how hot you look , my good barrois , '' said valentine . <EOS>	69.0743928995474
<SOS> `` ah , i have been running very fast , mademoiselle , but i must do m. morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster . '' <EOS>	98.62569093041938
<SOS> noirtier directed their attention to a waiter , on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass . <EOS>	109.3966531626231
<SOS> the decanter was nearly full , with the exception of a little , which had been already drunk by m. noirtier . <EOS>	101.23249454241062
<SOS> `` come , barrois , '' said the young girl , `` take some of this lemonade ; i see you are coveting a good draught of it . '' <EOS>	63.30450011803994
<SOS> `` the fact is , mademoiselle , '' said barrois , `` i am dying with thirst , and since you are so kind as to offer it me , i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it . '' <EOS>	84.04276182327372
<SOS> `` take some , then , and come back immediately . '' <EOS>	83.44837482963455
<SOS> barrois took away the waiter , and hardly was he outside the door , which in his haste he forgot to shut , than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled . <EOS>	84.27596068669065
<SOS> valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell . <EOS>	108.02455239654726
<SOS> it was the signal of a visit . <EOS>	71.26974386383772
<SOS> valentine looked at her watch . <EOS>	106.37172137744622
<SOS> `` it is past noon , '' said she , `` and today is saturday ; i dare say it is the doctor , grandpapa . '' <EOS>	83.00805383392596
<SOS> noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition . <EOS>	82.72431945441639
<SOS> `` he will come in here , and m. morrel had better go , do you not think so , grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	55.58166367007729
<SOS> `` yes , '' signed the old man . <EOS>	103.5456523302641
<SOS> `` barrois , '' cried valentine , `` barrois ! '' <EOS>	80.66874363647756
<SOS> `` i am coming , mademoiselle , '' replied he . <EOS>	69.49732361241031
<SOS> `` barrois will open the door for you , '' said valentine , addressing morrel . <EOS>	89.49047321271327
<SOS> `` and now remember one thing , monsieur officer , that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness . '' <EOS>	99.80420036497684
<SOS> < num > m `` i promised him to wait , '' replied morrel ; `` and i will wait . '' <EOS>	123.61479097646645
<SOS> at this moment barrois entered . <EOS>	74.04120437804907
<SOS> `` who rang ? '' <EOS>	80.41024555122883
<SOS> asked valentine . <EOS>	80.3054319879457
<SOS> `` doctor d'avrigny , '' said barrois , staggering as if he would fall . <EOS>	91.06742007279875
<SOS> `` what is the matter , barrois ? '' <EOS>	58.5746770900258
<SOS> said valentine . <EOS>	100.6886383560977
<SOS> the old man did not answer , but looked at his master with wild staring eyes , while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright . <EOS>	54.72492932554861
<SOS> `` he is going to fall ! '' <EOS>	77.48894448556842
<SOS> cried morrel . <EOS>	88.96367069319652
<SOS> the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased , the features of the face became quite altered , and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder . <EOS>	96.82964589062966
<SOS> noirtier , seeing barrois in this pitiable condition , showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man . <EOS>	86.91059281908561
<SOS> barrois made some steps towards his master . <EOS>	82.24550322586511
<SOS> `` ah , sir , '' said he , `` tell me what is the matter with me . <EOS>	105.24246255963757
<SOS> i am suffering i can not see . <EOS>	87.54653237576423
<SOS> a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain . <EOS>	76.8759019164894
<SOS> ah , do n't touch me , pray do n't . '' <EOS>	76.53446575594181
<SOS> by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets ; his head fell back , and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen . <EOS>	71.75892600831114
<SOS> valentine uttered a cry of horror ; morrel took her in his arms , as if to defend her from some unknown danger . <EOS>	91.58366121576584
<SOS> `` m. d'avrigny , m. d'avrigny , '' cried she , in a stifled voice . <EOS>	78.93639970974758
<SOS> `` help , help ! '' <EOS>	61.20721073179195
<SOS> barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps , then fell at the feet of noirtier , and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid , exclaimed : `` my master , my good master ! '' <EOS>	104.30839117792233
<SOS> at this moment m. de villefort , attracted by the noise , appeared on the threshold . <EOS>	99.80196171649678
<SOS> morrel relaxed his hold of valentine , and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain . <EOS>	86.50375031057139
<SOS> pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent , he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer . <EOS>	85.59201827178417
<SOS> noirtier , burning with impatience and terror , was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic , whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant . <EOS>	62.395228341574686
<SOS> one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye , trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body . <EOS>	86.77530931077814
<SOS> barrois , his features convulsed , his eyes suffused with blood , and his head thrown back , was lying at full length , beating the floor with his hands , while his legs had become so stiff , that they looked as if they would break rather than bend . <EOS>	115.32411149058743
<SOS> a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth , and he breathed painfully , and with extreme difficulty . <EOS>	80.91233563850956
<SOS> villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment , and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word . <EOS>	66.97169558090594
<SOS> he had not seen morrel . <EOS>	77.2930635619854
<SOS> after a moment of dumb contemplation , during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end , he sprang towards the door , crying out : `` doctor , doctor ! <EOS>	66.67197053651883
<SOS> come instantly , pray come ! '' <EOS>	92.81671624657392
<SOS> `` madame , madame ! '' <EOS>	88.37997473461034
<SOS> cried valentine , calling her step mother , and running upstairs to meet her ; `` come quick , quick ! <EOS>	58.21991120608211
<SOS> and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you . '' <EOS>	87.27853378594496
<SOS> `` what is the matter ? '' <EOS>	98.48049586666505
<SOS> said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone . <EOS>	97.08268052743448
<SOS> `` oh ! <EOS>	76.85750212573251
<SOS> come ! <EOS>	62.95936616436226
<SOS> come ! '' <EOS>	71.12912067582509
<SOS> `` but where is the doctor ? '' <EOS>	81.95479331165816
<SOS> exclaimed villefort ; `` where is he ? '' <EOS>	86.37528568100691
<SOS> madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase . <EOS>	92.37054184105565
<SOS> in one hand she held her handkerchief , with which she appeared to be wiping her face , and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts . <EOS>	88.30414984040445
<SOS> her first look on entering the room was at noirtier , whose face , independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing , proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health ; her second glance was at the dying man . <EOS>	88.32019717857044
<SOS> she turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master . <EOS>	73.03461448341189
<SOS> `` in the name of heaven , madame , '' said villefort , `` where is the doctor ? <EOS>	97.5462220626834
<SOS> he was with you just now . <EOS>	72.07633172067767
<SOS> you see this is a fit of apoplexy , and he might be saved if he could but be bled ! '' <EOS>	63.37731576094392
<SOS> `` has he eaten anything lately ? '' <EOS>	97.6445020085644
<SOS> asked madame de villefort , eluding her husband 's question . <EOS>	111.13269925359359
<SOS> `` madame , '' replied valentine , `` he has not even breakfasted . <EOS>	68.8243283007776
<SOS> he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him , and when he returned , took nothing but a glass of lemonade . '' <EOS>	99.20644396134179
<SOS> `` ah , '' said madame de villefort , `` why did he not take wine ? <EOS>	98.84779663512714
<SOS> lemonade was a very bad thing for him . '' <EOS>	63.29281734952337
<SOS> `` grandpapa 's bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side ; poor barrois was very thirsty , and was thankful to drink anything he could find . '' <EOS>	73.81624854380203
<SOS> madame de villefort started . <EOS>	90.90718600561425
<SOS> noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny . <EOS>	82.35442619930022
<SOS> `` he has such a short neck , '' said she . <EOS>	91.41269151874118
<SOS> `` madame , '' said villefort , `` i ask where is m. d'avrigny ? <EOS>	84.11881202576411
<SOS> in god 's name answer me ! '' <EOS>	59.95140257193947
<SOS> `` he is with edward , who is not quite well , '' replied madame de villefort , no longer being able to avoid answering . <EOS>	90.210490522733
<SOS> villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him . <EOS>	84.14068399671494
<SOS> `` take this , '' said madame de villefort , giving her smelling bottle to valentine . <EOS>	119.63594705939015
<SOS> `` they will , no doubt , bleed him ; therefore i will retire , for i can not endure the sight of blood ; '' and she followed her husband upstairs . <EOS>	94.45703173060706
<SOS> morrel now emerged from his hiding place , where he had remained quite unperceived , so great had been the general confusion . <EOS>	96.32904899449905
<SOS> `` go away as quick as you can , maximilian , '' said valentine , `` and stay till i send for you . <EOS>	119.4514991394694
<SOS> go . '' <EOS>	110.35078004874727
<SOS> morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire . <EOS>	94.5760345539319
<SOS> the old man , who had preserved all his usual coolness , made a sign to him to do so . <EOS>	77.47855336104942
<SOS> the young man pressed valentine 's hand to his lips , and then left the house by a back staircase . <EOS>	61.35632662969839
<SOS> at the same moment that he quitted the room , villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door . <EOS>	110.89275660150705
<SOS> barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness . <EOS>	105.85017855536289
<SOS> the crisis seemed past , a low moaning was heard , and he raised himself on one knee . <EOS>	79.65429863099256
<SOS> d'avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch . <EOS>	103.38325744865368
<SOS> `` what do you prescribe , doctor ? '' <EOS>	74.70813390218
<SOS> demanded villefort . <EOS>	108.5228958629595
<SOS> `` give me some water and ether . <EOS>	63.97535334431463
<SOS> you have some in the house , have you not ? '' <EOS>	82.33308303009052
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	102.34603408058426
<SOS> `` send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic . '' <EOS>	71.62398444219501

<SOS> `` and now let everyone retire . '' <EOS>	85.56610490845435
<SOS> `` must i go too ? '' <EOS>	66.46205692713748
<SOS> asked valentine timidly . <EOS>	59.31422013058497
<SOS> `` yes , mademoiselle , you especially , '' replied the doctor abruptly . <EOS>	76.00491693176733
<SOS> valentine looked at m. d'avrigny with astonishment , kissed her grandfather on the forehead , and left the room . <EOS>	60.77811454367364
<SOS> the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air . <EOS>	122.3233055881597
<SOS> `` look , look , doctor , '' said villefort , `` he is quite coming round again ; i really do not think , after all , it is anything of consequence . '' <EOS>	71.64235786416381
<SOS> m. d'avrigny answered by a melancholy smile . <EOS>	79.97566956354177
<SOS> `` how do you feel , barrois ? '' <EOS>	65.47618309522197
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	64.96418434676713
<SOS> `` a little better , sir . '' <EOS>	73.19958141884197
<SOS> `` will you drink some of this ether and water ? '' <EOS>	70.64658924567891

<SOS> this second attack was much more violent than the first , and he had slipped from the couch to the ground , where he was writhing in agony . <EOS>	84.52972273151167

<SOS> look closely ! '' <EOS>	70.88437804894637
<SOS> the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup , and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup ; this sediment first took a blue shade , then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal , and from opal to emerald . <EOS>	102.0099681313992
<SOS> arrived at this last hue , it changed no more . <EOS>	63.04729224862754

<SOS> he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window , and , after an ingenious preamble , related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father 's departure . <EOS>	97.22914432716237
<SOS> he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker 's family , in which he had been received as a son , and where , besides , his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars . <EOS>	86.51711519742531
<SOS> danglars listened with the most profound attention ; he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days , and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf . <EOS>	96.4040741376694
<SOS> he would not , however , yield immediately to the young man 's request , but made a few conscientious objections . <EOS>	100.13050924625271
<SOS> `` are you not rather young , m. andrea , to think of marrying ? '' <EOS>	85.36464281527687

<SOS> life is so uncertain , that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach . '' <EOS>	67.14443417950757
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said danglars , `` in case your proposals , which do me honor , are accepted by my wife and daughter , by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled ? <EOS>	90.57322630737227

<SOS> correcting himself immediately , he said , `` excuse me , sir ; hope alone makes me almost mad , what will not reality do ? '' <EOS>	81.48983645279152
<SOS> `` but , '' said danglars , who , on his part , did not perceive how soon the conversation , which was at first disinterested , was turning to a business transaction , `` there is , doubtless , a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you ? '' <EOS>	81.48773431909018

<SOS> danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure , or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up . <EOS>	79.53400270790112
<SOS> `` well , sir , '' said andrea , bowing to the banker respectfully , `` may i hope ? '' <EOS>	93.11066874147552
<SOS> `` you may not only hope , '' said danglars , `` but consider it a settled thing , if no obstacle arises on your part . '' <EOS>	83.9127267850247

<SOS> `` i have just left the count , sir , '' said he ; `` he is , doubtless , a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas . <EOS>	85.61468847124473
<SOS> he esteems me highly . <EOS>	86.22625848540275
<SOS> he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property . <EOS>	91.93463398657414
<SOS> he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me ; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another , and he never would . <EOS>	83.183616709
<SOS> i must , however , do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion , because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one . <EOS>	92.2545512666192
<SOS> besides , if he will do nothing officially , he will answer any questions you propose to him . <EOS>	74.16330955875875

<SOS> `` you are about my height , pierre , '' said he . <EOS>	112.39614199927482
<SOS> `` i have that honor , your excellency . '' <EOS>	73.31322730101226
<SOS> `` you had a new livery yesterday ? '' <EOS>	124.64103158315466
<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	67.79037844557119
<SOS> `` i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening , and do not wish to be known ; lend me your livery till tomorrow . <EOS>	68.90188704642782
<SOS> i may sleep , perhaps , at an inn . '' <EOS>	97.64036491469624
<SOS> pierre obeyed . <EOS>	70.99381542764479
<SOS> five minutes after , andrea left the hotel , completely disguised , took a cabriolet , and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge , at picpus . <EOS>	100.81131014286218
<SOS> the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes , without being noticed , walked down the faubourg saint antoine , along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant , and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter 's absence . <EOS>	81.94194128354857
<SOS> `` for whom are you looking , my fine fellow ? '' <EOS>	67.65202391446208
<SOS> asked the fruiteress on the opposite side . <EOS>	77.59445733272361
<SOS> `` monsieur pailletin , if you please , my good woman , '' replied andrea . <EOS>	74.18741011161113
<SOS> `` a retired baker ? '' <EOS>	73.65099904193046
<SOS> asked the fruiteress . <EOS>	99.24113166089761
<SOS> `` exactly . '' <EOS>	94.99327070403525
<SOS> `` he lives at the end of the yard , on the left , on the third story . '' <EOS>	53.43751791190542
<SOS> < num > m andrea went as she directed him , and on the third floor he found a hare 's paw , which , by the hasty ringing of the bell , it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper . <EOS>	65.6643896120018
<SOS> a moment after caderousse 's face appeared at the grating in the door . <EOS>	86.13629975967041
<SOS> `` ah ! <EOS>	93.90276042391261
<SOS> you are punctual , '' said he , as he drew back the door . <EOS>	94.40382695230062
<SOS> `` confound you and your punctuality ! '' <EOS>	104.32128064588326
<SOS> said andrea , throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host . <EOS>	101.0814346839407
<SOS> `` come , come , my little fellow , do n't be angry . <EOS>	116.13329506709081
<SOS> see , i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have ; nothing but what you are fond of . '' <EOS>	77.21552509387587
<SOS> andrea , indeed , inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him , hungry as he was ; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order , added to that of dried fish , and above all , the pungent smell of musk and cloves . <EOS>	74.19315773683368
<SOS> these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove , and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot . <EOS>	87.00404341718759
<SOS> in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two , two bottles of wine sealed , the one with green , the other with yellow , a supply of brandy in a decanter , and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf , cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate . <EOS>	67.14268573723812
<SOS> `` what do you think of it , my little fellow ? '' <EOS>	80.24263979597382
<SOS> said caderousse . <EOS>	112.7208433931402
<SOS> `` ay , that smells good ! <EOS>	102.9567160269901
<SOS> you know i used to be a good cook ; do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers ? <EOS>	80.37467344390711
<SOS> you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes , and i think you relished them tolerably . '' <EOS>	84.88142879745618
<SOS> while speaking , caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions . <EOS>	81.32031488062891
<SOS> `` but , '' said andrea , ill temperedly , `` by my faith , if it was only to breakfast with you , that you disturbed me , i wish the devil had taken you ! '' <EOS>	75.9014695601553
<SOS> `` my boy , '' said caderousse sententiously , `` one can talk while eating . <EOS>	84.89395079647247
<SOS> and then , you ungrateful being , you are not pleased to see an old friend ? <EOS>	104.45902960135419
<SOS> i am weeping with joy . '' <EOS>	68.15279472744612
<SOS> he was truly crying , but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard . <EOS>	85.33949260926165
<SOS> `` hold your tongue , hypocrite , '' said andrea ; `` you love me ! '' <EOS>	92.83878769864317
<SOS> `` yes , i do , or may the devil take me . <EOS>	72.97884154622442
<SOS> i know it is a weakness , '' said caderousse , `` but it overpowers me . '' <EOS>	77.09719494204325
<SOS> `` and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick . '' <EOS>	86.1108405049453
<SOS> `` come , '' said caderousse , wiping his large knife on his apron , `` if i did not like you , do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me ? <EOS>	77.79411758024384
<SOS> think for a moment . <EOS>	75.97711063993982
<SOS> you have your servant 's clothes on you therefore keep a servant ; i have none , and am obliged to prepare my own meals . <EOS>	78.4612170409941
<SOS> you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d'hôte of the hôtel des princes , or the café de paris . <EOS>	87.41824723264878
<SOS> well , i too could keep a servant ; i too could have a tilbury ; i too could dine where i like ; but why do i not ? <EOS>	80.00054770964562
<SOS> because i would not annoy my little benedetto . <EOS>	59.12998835068448
<SOS> come , just acknowledge that i could , eh ? '' <EOS>	100.82018578898341
<SOS> this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand . <EOS>	62.79700704549355
<SOS> `` well , '' said andrea , `` admitting your love , why do you want me to breakfast with you ? '' <EOS>	80.57454755305292
<SOS> `` that i may have the pleasure of seeing you , my little fellow . '' <EOS>	94.87938680619716
<SOS> `` what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements ? '' <EOS>	92.53349102136562
<SOS> `` eh , dear friend , '' said caderousse , `` are wills ever made without codicils ? <EOS>	85.74140078565094
<SOS> but you first came to breakfast , did you not ? <EOS>	88.18497397082898
<SOS> well , sit down , and let us begin with these pilchards , and this fresh butter ; which i have put on some vine leaves to please you , wicked one . <EOS>	92.9643898849129
<SOS> ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my images , three francs each . <EOS>	66.13236765658442
<SOS> but what do you expect ? <EOS>	66.48006421200355
<SOS> this is not the hôtel des princes . '' <EOS>	121.06166320732844
<SOS> `` come , you are growing discontented , you are no longer happy ; you , who only wish to live like a retired baker . '' <EOS>	71.50409515543781
<SOS> caderousse sighed . <EOS>	63.12592484690818
<SOS> `` well , what have you to say ? <EOS>	89.06176276690131
<SOS> you have seen your dream realized . '' <EOS>	102.59050425171691
<SOS> `` i can still say it is a dream ; a retired baker , my poor benedetto , is rich he has an annuity . '' <EOS>	111.20039269999052
<SOS> `` well , you have an annuity . '' <EOS>	107.49167753797018
<SOS> `` i have ? '' <EOS>	84.36354639046343
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , since i bring you your two hundred francs . '' <EOS>	74.92610602704552
<SOS> caderousse shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	64.60734536809494
<SOS> `` it is humiliating , '' said he , `` thus to receive money given grudgingly , an uncertain supply which may soon fail . <EOS>	102.8039323254055
<SOS> you see i am obliged to economize , in case your prosperity should cease . <EOS>	73.07618327405854
<SOS> well , my friend , fortune is inconstant , as the chaplain of the regiment said . <EOS>	75.07455342139262
<SOS> i know your prosperity is great , you rascal ; you are to marry the daughter of danglars . '' <EOS>	84.35065765055124
<SOS> `` what ? <EOS>	98.58486600607995
<SOS> of danglars ? '' <EOS>	64.90280652219666
<SOS> `` yes , to be sure ; must i say baron danglars ? <EOS>	66.31511743174627
<SOS> i might as well say count benedetto . <EOS>	103.1084618607597
<SOS> he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding , seeing he came to mine . <EOS>	85.60545703752611
<SOS> yes , yes , to mine ; gad , he was not so proud then , he was an under clerk to the good m. morrel . <EOS>	78.41947612137298
<SOS> i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf , so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little , we might meet in the same drawing rooms . '' <EOS>	94.82171556639159
<SOS> `` come , your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light . '' <EOS>	119.48362029066618
<SOS> `` that is all very fine , benedetto mio , but i know what i am saying . <EOS>	97.22022711976642
<SOS> perhaps i may one day put on my best coat , and presenting myself at the great gate , introduce myself . <EOS>	116.70351401658577
<SOS> meanwhile let us sit down and eat . '' <EOS>	99.45850972292607
<SOS> caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite , praising each dish he set before his visitor . <EOS>	67.72434613627452
<SOS> the latter seemed to have resigned himself ; he drew the corks , and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat . <EOS>	71.6437627091271
<SOS> `` ah , mate , '' said caderousse , `` you are getting on better terms with your old landlord ! '' <EOS>	73.73765386426177
<SOS> `` faith , yes , '' replied andrea , whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling . <EOS>	70.64519618858385
<SOS> `` so you like it , you rogue ? '' <EOS>	73.26074908294049
<SOS> `` so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living . '' <EOS>	94.63218043684103
<SOS> `` do you see , '' said caderousse , `` all my happiness is marred by one thought ? '' <EOS>	95.66490357626114
<SOS> `` what is that ? '' <EOS>	68.54426117511947
<SOS> `` that i am dependent on another , i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly . '' <EOS>	103.21284794251578
<SOS> `` do not let that disturb you , i have enough for two . '' <EOS>	112.74315085239691
<SOS> `` no , truly ; you may believe me if you will ; at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse . '' <EOS>	66.82132196687527
<SOS> `` good caderousse ! '' <EOS>	84.89178920518606
<SOS> `` so much so , that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs . '' <EOS>	92.42775498242189
<SOS> `` yes , you wished to speak to me ; but was it indeed remorse , tell me ? '' <EOS>	91.73246073543743
<SOS> `` true remorse ; and , besides , an idea had struck me . '' <EOS>	78.09478261095808
<SOS> andrea shuddered ; he always did so at caderousse 's ideas . <EOS>	93.06083039993405
<SOS> `` it is miserable do you see ? <EOS>	96.6911801432683
<SOS> always to wait till the end of the month . '' <EOS>	67.59967483590654
<SOS> `` oh , '' said andrea philosophically , determined to watch his companion narrowly , `` does not life pass in waiting ? <EOS>	71.06396272400538
<SOS> do i , for instance , fare better ? <EOS>	101.14491373161663
<SOS> well , i wait patiently , do i not ? '' <EOS>	102.07880293509142
<SOS> `` yes ; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs , you expect five or six thousand , perhaps ten , perhaps even twelve , for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost . <EOS>	83.71996456455096
<SOS> down there , you always had little presents and christmas boxes , which you tried to hide from your poor friend caderousse . <EOS>	92.43512192920953
<SOS> fortunately he is a cunning fellow , that friend caderousse . '' <EOS>	93.8441811381061
<SOS> `` there you are beginning again to ramble , to talk again and again of the past ! <EOS>	71.78489888502952
<SOS> but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ? '' <EOS>	80.50444125047795
<SOS> `` ah , you are only one and twenty , and can forget the past ; i am fifty , and am obliged to recollect it . <EOS>	79.31803906831324
<SOS> but let us return to business . '' <EOS>	88.46176022884183
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	62.23935241722511
<SOS> `` i was going to say , if i were in your place `` `` well . '' <EOS>	71.64921106590296
<SOS> `` i would realize `` `` how would you realize ? '' <EOS>	113.56559790424079
<SOS> `` i would ask for six months ' in advance , under pretence of being able to purchase a farm , then with my six months i would decamp . '' <EOS>	86.71227861491704
<SOS> `` well , well , '' said andrea , `` that is n't a bad idea . '' <EOS>	68.41554177576026
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' said caderousse , `` eat of my bread , and take my advice ; you will be none the worse off , physically or morally . '' <EOS>	68.28493696936538
<SOS> `` but , '' said andrea , `` why do you not act on the advice you gave me ? <EOS>	112.88707429537813
<SOS> why do you not realize a six months ' , a year 's advance even , and retire to brussels ? <EOS>	78.96573938927979
<SOS> instead of living the retired baker , you might live as a bankrupt , using his privileges ; that would be very good . '' <EOS>	54.769859347187136
<SOS> `` but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ? '' <EOS>	74.24255991106165
<SOS> `` ah , caderousse , '' said andrea , `` how covetous you are ! <EOS>	70.41827627430294
<SOS> two months ago you were dying with hunger . '' <EOS>	87.61557779248982
<SOS> `` the appetite grows by what it feeds on , '' said caderousse , grinning and showing his teeth , like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling . <EOS>	69.36064851213479
<SOS> `` and , '' added he , biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread , `` i have formed a plan . '' <EOS>	115.14245712868443
<SOS> caderousse 's plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas ; ideas were but the germ , the plan was reality . <EOS>	89.97389014023406
<SOS> `` let me see your plan ; i dare say it is a pretty one . '' <EOS>	74.61983088106987

<SOS> was it not i ? <EOS>	74.01808074190264
<SOS> and it was no bad one i believe , since here we are ! '' <EOS>	91.06899199821962
<SOS> `` i do not say , '' replied andrea , `` that you never make a good one ; but let us see your plan . '' <EOS>	74.83642794881928
<SOS> `` well , '' pursued caderousse , `` can you without expending one sou , put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs ? <EOS>	112.54873289736702
<SOS> no , fifteen thousand are not enough , i can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs . '' <EOS>	57.30235446109457
<SOS> `` no , '' replied andrea , dryly , `` no , i can not . '' <EOS>	88.38010224287515
<SOS> `` i do not think you understand me , '' replied caderousse , calmly ; `` i said without your laying out a sou . '' <EOS>	91.57198984356712
<SOS> `` do you want me to commit a robbery , to spoil all my good fortune and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again ? '' <EOS>	83.95454115804066
<SOS> `` it would make very little difference to me , '' said caderousse , `` if i were retaken , i am a poor creature to live alone , and sometimes pine for my old comrades ; not like you , heartless creature , who would be glad never to see them again . '' <EOS>	92.34301395274424
<SOS> andrea did more than tremble this time , he turned pale . <EOS>	110.05342550496985
<SOS> `` come , caderousse , no nonsense ! '' <EOS>	62.711544303968275

<SOS> `` meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs , my little fellow ? <EOS>	83.56310259070936
<SOS> i have a fancy , and mean to get a housekeeper . '' <EOS>	74.1740747288672
<SOS> `` well , you shall have your five hundred francs , '' said andrea ; `` but it is very hard for me , my poor caderousse you take advantage `` `` bah , '' said caderousse , `` when you have access to countless stores . '' <EOS>	75.15389738890613

<SOS> the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place , the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil , accompanied by ali and several attendants , and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining . <EOS>	95.88270162560008
<SOS> he was induced to undertake this journey , of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either , by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop . <EOS>	68.52348979974352
<SOS> the house was ready , and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men , who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea . <EOS>	87.37741679966197
<SOS> the count praised bertuccio 's zeal , and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure , as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month . <EOS>	79.51908435493283
<SOS> `` now , '' said he , `` i may require to go in one night from paris to tréport ; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road , which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours . '' <EOS>	101.07750717437276
<SOS> `` your highness had already expressed that wish , '' said bertuccio , `` and the horses are ready . <EOS>	78.1516420240794
<SOS> i have bought them , and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts , that is , in villages , where no one generally stops . '' <EOS>	104.8044891368918
<SOS> `` that 's well , '' said monte cristo ; `` i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly . '' <EOS>	80.41406046716794
<SOS> as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders , baptistin opened the door : he held a letter on a silver waiter . <EOS>	62.03935718377785
<SOS> `` what are you doing here ? '' <EOS>	81.23236724292502
<SOS> asked the count , seeing him covered with dust ; `` i did not send for you , i think ? '' <EOS>	72.15858848140167
<SOS> baptistin , without answering , approached the count , and presented the letter . <EOS>	85.64693843826173
<SOS> `` important and urgent , '' said he . <EOS>	90.83050050991349
<SOS> the count opened the letter , and read : `` 'm . <EOS>	89.8025931322724

<SOS> the count 's well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police , whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice . <EOS>	90.13055898798372
<SOS> the count , by any opening from the bedroom , or by concealing himself in the dressing room , would be able to defend his property himself . <EOS>	65.44855136606816
<SOS> many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt , and m. de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count , a warning he might not be able to send another time , if this first attempt should fail and another be made . ' '' <EOS>	102.97416977270824
<SOS> the count 's first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception , to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater . <EOS>	54.989522324938605
<SOS> he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police , notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend , or perhaps because of that advice , when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy , whom he alone should recognize and over whom , if such were the case , he alone would gain any advantage , as fiesco < num > had done over the moor who would have killed him . <EOS>	93.00597223015765
<SOS> we know the count 's vigorous and daring mind , denying anything to be impossible , with that energy which marks the great man . <EOS>	66.83227875073891
<SOS> from his past life , from his resolution to shrink from nothing , the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged , sometimes against nature , that is to say , against god , and sometimes against the world , that is , against the devil . <EOS>	76.44332987682232
<SOS> `` they do not want my papers , '' said monte cristo , `` they want to kill me ; they are no robbers , but assassins . <EOS>	88.9148740159992
<SOS> i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs . <EOS>	91.2606627482659
<SOS> i am rich enough , forsooth , to distribute his authority on this occasion . '' <EOS>	83.57730478356201
<SOS> the count recalled baptistin , who had left the room after delivering the letter . <EOS>	59.80770112342154
<SOS> `` return to paris , '' said he ; `` assemble the servants who remain there . <EOS>	75.03404325704754

<SOS> `` but will no one remain in the house , my lord ? '' <EOS>	88.05610918785911
<SOS> asked baptistin . <EOS>	79.59836058868892

<SOS> `` you are a fool , m. baptistin . <EOS>	110.06993030574138
<SOS> thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed . '' <EOS>	100.1082315619118
<SOS> baptistin bowed . <EOS>	67.52698265811996
<SOS> < num > m `` you understand me ? '' <EOS>	62.13897692573907
<SOS> said the count . <EOS>	84.11509975087334
<SOS> `` bring your comrades here , one and all ; but let everything remain as usual , only close the shutters of the ground floor . '' <EOS>	97.66097493870068
<SOS> `` and those of the first floor ? '' <EOS>	101.24785853616761
<SOS> `` you know they are never closed . <EOS>	96.75225882007332
<SOS> go ! '' <EOS>	80.90686250257659
<SOS> the count signified his intention of dining alone , and that no one but ali should attend him . <EOS>	112.37741296593477
<SOS> having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation , the count , making a signal to ali to follow him , went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned , apparently without design towards paris and at twilight ; found himself opposite his house in the champs élysées . <EOS>	75.63365043217338
<SOS> all was dark ; one solitary , feeble light was burning in the porter 's lodge , about forty paces distant from the house , as baptistin had said . <EOS>	108.79696282732671
<SOS> monte cristo leaned against a tree , and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived , looked up and down the avenue , examined the passers by , and carefully looked down the neighboring streets , to see that no one was concealed . <EOS>	89.00448949257863
<SOS> ten minutes passed thus , and he was convinced that no one was watching him . <EOS>	82.80665630102854
<SOS> he hastened to the side door with ali , entered hurriedly , and by the servants ' staircase , of which he had the key , gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain , without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he supposed empty , contained its chief occupant . <EOS>	76.14492044409745
<SOS> arrived in his bedroom , the count motioned to ali to stop ; then he passed into the dressing room , which he examined . <EOS>	83.70696454242785
<SOS> everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place , and the key in the secretaire . <EOS>	84.89232986677429
<SOS> he double locked it , took the key , returned to the bedroom door , removed the double staple of the bolt , and went in . <EOS>	98.31015770684222
<SOS> meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely , a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols , with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one . <EOS>	93.62680299506965
<SOS> thus armed , the count held the lives of five men in his hands . <EOS>	104.71978048299118
<SOS> it was about half past nine . <EOS>	81.43889802195386
<SOS> the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine ; then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels , which enabled him to see into the adjoining room . <EOS>	78.46591660203703
<SOS> he had within his reach his pistols and carbine , and ali , standing near him , held one of the small arabian hatchets , whose form has not varied since the crusades . <EOS>	66.4675880840425
<SOS> through one of the windows of the bedroom , on a line with that in the dressing room , the count could see into the street . <EOS>	98.66983723967967
<SOS> two hours passed thus . <EOS>	106.78943750838894
<SOS> it was intensely dark ; still ali , thanks to his wild nature , and the count , thanks doubtless to his long confinement , could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees . <EOS>	56.28190054308565
<SOS> the little light in the lodge had long been extinct . <EOS>	57.61803995249701
<SOS> it might be expected that the attack , if indeed an attack was projected , would be made from the staircase of the ground floor , and not from a window ; in monte cristo 's opinion , the villains sought his life , not his money . <EOS>	97.06809192186992
<SOS> it would be his bedroom they would attack , and they must reach it by the back staircase , or by the window in the dressing room . <EOS>	100.09295933395134
<SOS> the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve ; the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes . <EOS>	103.5709036415425
<SOS> < num > m as the last stroke died away , the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room ; this first sound , or rather this first grinding , was followed by a second , then a third ; at the fourth , the count knew what to expect . <EOS>	82.0213954918533
<SOS> a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond . <EOS>	86.5158183113776
<SOS> the count felt his heart beat more rapidly . <EOS>	80.60887740023672
<SOS> inured as men may be to danger , forewarned as they may be of peril , they understand , by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame , the enormous difference between a dream and a reality , between the project and the execution . <EOS>	65.92066261506643
<SOS> however , monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali , who , understanding that danger was approaching from the other side , drew nearer to his master . <EOS>	81.09400756140359
<SOS> monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies . <EOS>	71.92469547514236
<SOS> the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room . <EOS>	61.564656251251364
<SOS> he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness ; then one of the panes became quite opaque , as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside , then the square cracked without falling . <EOS>	95.65837112815898
<SOS> through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening , then a second ; the window turned on its hinges , and a man entered . <EOS>	98.18461218880081
<SOS> he was alone . <EOS>	89.03855359184807
<SOS> `` that 's a daring rascal , '' whispered the count . <EOS>	79.47485853895544
<SOS> at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder . <EOS>	100.25087619325657
<SOS> he turned ; ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were , facing the street . <EOS>	73.82632311209873
<SOS> `` i see ! '' <EOS>	76.79590229621719
<SOS> said he , `` there are two of them ; one does the work while the other stands guard . '' <EOS>	71.32968642876133
<SOS> he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street , and turned to the one in the dressing room . <EOS>	72.18895889411954
<SOS> the glass cutter had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms stretched out before him . <EOS>	86.19588139596753
<SOS> at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings . <EOS>	90.09299288401128
<SOS> there were two doors ; he bolted them both . <EOS>	59.32370706148475
<SOS> when he drew near to the bedroom door , monte cristo expected that he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols ; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings . <EOS>	82.48240340743311
<SOS> it was only a precaution . <EOS>	94.10048412216777
<SOS> the nocturnal visitor , ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples , might now think himself at home , and pursue his purpose with full security . <EOS>	73.91819064540324
<SOS> alone and free to act as he wished , the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern , placed it on a stand , then went straight to the secretaire , felt the lock , and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing . <EOS>	110.34696464530619
<SOS> but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies . <EOS>	71.37742424057572
<SOS> the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys , such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock , and which thieves call nightingales , doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt . <EOS>	89.50118512226304
<SOS> `` ah , ha , '' whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment , `` he is only a thief . '' <EOS>	100.16267437433122
<SOS> but the man in the dark could not find the right key . <EOS>	77.82016536593906
<SOS> he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand , touched a spring , and immediately a pale light , just bright enough to render objects distinct , was reflected on his hands and countenance . <EOS>	85.97384006626143
<SOS> `` by heavens , '' exclaimed monte cristo , starting back , `` it is `` ali raised his hatchet . <EOS>	65.3701732744808
<SOS> `` do n't stir , '' whispered monte cristo , `` and put down your hatchet ; we shall require no arms . '' <EOS>	106.406137353064
<SOS> < num > m then he added some words in a low tone , for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count , faint as it had been , had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder . <EOS>	83.80087236605992
<SOS> it was an order the count had just given , for immediately ali went noiselessly , and returned , bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat . <EOS>	73.24677451335872
<SOS> meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat , waistcoat , and shirt , and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail , of which the last in france , where daggers are no longer dreaded , was worn by king louis xvi. , who feared the dagger at his breast , and whose head was cleft with a hatchet . <EOS>	61.486027777676625
<SOS> the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock , as did his hair under a priest 's wig ; the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé . <EOS>	102.0259442716379
<SOS> the man , hearing nothing more , stood erect , and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire , whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale . <EOS>	72.16372716181355
<SOS> `` try again , '' whispered the count , who depended on the secret spring , which was unknown to the picklock , clever as he might be `` try again , you have a few minutes ' work there . '' <EOS>	79.2489785858491
<SOS> and he advanced to the window . <EOS>	89.30406752688442
<SOS> the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down , and was still pacing the street ; but , strange as it appeared , he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré ; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count 's , and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room . <EOS>	77.79090838246901
<SOS> monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips ; then drawing near to ali , he whispered : `` remain here , concealed in the dark , and whatever noise you hear , whatever passes , only come in or show yourself if i call you . '' <EOS>	62.76062442702936
<SOS> ali bowed in token of strict obedience . <EOS>	84.12076867016158
<SOS> monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet , and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock , silently opened the door , taking care that the light should shine directly on his face . <EOS>	60.22336539955972
<SOS> the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound ; but , to his astonishment , the room was suddenly illuminated . <EOS>	85.16074671922945
<SOS> he turned . <EOS>	77.65923155469672
<SOS> `` ah , good evening , my dear m. caderousse , '' said monte cristo ; `` what are you doing here , at such an hour ? '' <EOS>	71.46028896673278
<SOS> < num > m `` the abbé busoni ! '' <EOS>	89.13234418716212
<SOS> exclaimed caderousse ; and , not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors , he let fall his bunch of keys , and remained motionless and stupefied . <EOS>	73.05736316268089
<SOS> the count placed himself between caderousse and the window , thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat . <EOS>	65.00153324717796
<SOS> `` the abbé busoni ! '' <EOS>	87.82452859113822
<SOS> repeated caderousse , fixing his haggard gaze on the count . <EOS>	74.55218071915472
<SOS> `` yes , undoubtedly , the abbé busoni himself , '' replied monte cristo . <EOS>	73.47823720257553
<SOS> `` and i am very glad you recognize me , dear m. caderousse ; it proves you have a good memory , for it must be about ten years since we last met . '' <EOS>	67.51144921851595
<SOS> this calmness of busoni , combined with his irony and boldness , staggered caderousse . <EOS>	89.7969177977358
<SOS> `` the abbé , the abbé ! '' <EOS>	101.21450129002494
<SOS> murmured he , clenching his fists , and his teeth chattering . <EOS>	117.04584770208866
<SOS> `` so you would rob the count of monte cristo ? '' <EOS>	69.52814567457756
<SOS> continued the false abbé . <EOS>	74.5034717741522
<SOS> `` reverend sir , '' murmured caderousse , seeking to regain the window , which the count pitilessly blocked `` reverend sir , i do n't know believe me i take my oath `` `` a pane of glass out , '' continued the count , `` a dark lantern , a bunch of false keys , a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident `` caderousse was choking ; he looked around for some corner to hide in , some way of escape . <EOS>	66.94212560262136
<SOS> `` come , come , '' continued the count , `` i see you are still the same , an assassin . '' <EOS>	85.33392410998037
<SOS> `` reverend sir , since you know everything , you know it was not i it was la carconte ; that was proved at the trial , since i was only condemned to the galleys . '' <EOS>	92.0434074684072
<SOS> `` is your time , then , expired , since i find you in a fair way to return there ? '' <EOS>	66.08553199894504
<SOS> `` no , reverend sir ; i have been liberated by someone . '' <EOS>	104.24856602748159
<SOS> `` that someone has done society a great kindness . '' <EOS>	120.58786035598153
<SOS> `` ah , '' said caderousse , `` i had promised `` `` and you are breaking your promise ! '' <EOS>	81.02605718241153
<SOS> interrupted monte cristo . <EOS>	63.76623295311605
<SOS> `` alas , yes ! '' <EOS>	81.43486505407405
<SOS> said caderousse very uneasily . <EOS>	56.77760622951269
<SOS> `` a bad relapse , that will lead you , if i mistake not , to the place de grève . <EOS>	61.99325252819618

<SOS> `` poverty `` `` pshaw ! '' <EOS>	73.75865174851876
<SOS> said busoni disdainfully ; `` poverty may make a man beg , steal a loaf of bread at a baker 's door , but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited . <EOS>	99.34829190871194
<SOS> and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you < num > , < num > francs for the diamond i had given you , and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both , was that also poverty ? '' <EOS>	88.22324548024898

<SOS> monte cristo returned to his bedroom , and , glancing rapidly from the garden to the street , he saw first caderousse , who after walking to the end of the garden , fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in . <EOS>	93.4664271211937
<SOS> the count then looking over into the street , saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction , and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over . <EOS>	106.1832286035312

<SOS> beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight . <EOS>	82.51300064974576
<SOS> the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin . <EOS>	85.40237834866183
<SOS> the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer . <EOS>	93.39146148856368
<SOS> caderousse 's knife , dark lantern , bunch of keys , and clothing , excepting the waistcoat , which could not be found , were deposited at the registry ; the corpse was conveyed to the morgue . <EOS>	87.91023877574487
<SOS> the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil , and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni , who that evening , by mere chance , had requested to pass the night in his house , to examine some valuable books in his library . <EOS>	93.5775706388802
<SOS> bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedetto 's name was mentioned in his presence , but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so . <EOS>	78.67735409344648
<SOS> villefort , being called on to prove the crime , was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases . <EOS>	56.14598331980355
<SOS> but three weeks had already passed , and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful ; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti . <EOS>	94.23409934188842
<SOS> it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place , as the young man was received at the banker 's as the betrothed . <EOS>	71.74710779304007
<SOS> letters had been despatched to m. cavalcanti , as the count 's father , who highly approved of the union , regretted his inability to leave parma at that time , and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres . <EOS>	81.05045598113865
<SOS> it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest ; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father in law , who had of late sustained repeated losses ; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen , or to express a single doubt to the baron . <EOS>	98.23733337436119

<SOS> with an instinctive hatred of matrimony , she suffered andrea 's attentions in order to get rid of morcerf ; but when andrea urged his suit , she betrayed an entire dislike to him . <EOS>	65.12519203175194
<SOS> the baron might possibly have perceived it , but , attributing it to a caprice , feigned ignorance . <EOS>	87.80916076393399
<SOS> the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired . <EOS>	102.1364790934818
<SOS> morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord . <EOS>	88.32657831924995
<SOS> no one had taken up the remark about the general , and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers . <EOS>	68.22182868957724
<SOS> albert , however , felt no less insulted ; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult . <EOS>	91.46135519387583
<SOS> besides , the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart . <EOS>	68.4307574667766
<SOS> he cherished the thought of the duel , hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds . <EOS>	78.0404531554916

<SOS> `` ah , yes , indeed , '' said monte cristo with a sigh ; `` and do you think she is in the least interested in me ? '' <EOS>	77.866438832557
<SOS> `` i repeat it , you must really be a very strange and superior man , for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited , that when i am with her she speaks of no one else . '' <EOS>	79.57635426141563
<SOS> `` and does she try to make you dislike me ? '' <EOS>	85.38014030295794

<SOS> `` indeed ? '' <EOS>	69.1120652569595
<SOS> said monte cristo , sighing . <EOS>	97.63774518312175
<SOS> `` you see , then , '' said albert , `` that instead of opposing , she will encourage me . '' <EOS>	85.317613374045
<SOS> `` adieu , then , until five o'clock ; be punctual , and we shall arrive at twelve or one . '' <EOS>	76.29189856756501

<SOS> `` yes ; or in the neighborhood . '' <EOS>	82.10962208262112
<SOS> `` but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight hours ? '' <EOS>	68.5237881175377
<SOS> `` easily , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	85.19081551629769
<SOS> `` you are certainly a prodigy ; you will soon not only surpass the railway , which would not be very difficult in france , but even the telegraph . '' <EOS>	89.8463096189108

<SOS> `` do not fear , i have little to prepare . '' <EOS>	95.56214020784279
<SOS> monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert , then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation . <EOS>	107.77233157861868
<SOS> but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie , he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered . <EOS>	119.47045314968163
<SOS> `` bertuccio , '' said he , `` i intend going this evening to normandy , instead of tomorrow or the next day . <EOS>	74.04912788100809

<SOS> m. de morcerf will accompany me . '' <EOS>	89.08702914332972
<SOS> bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o'clock . <EOS>	73.59972342932117
<SOS> from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage , and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready . <EOS>	108.450631835527
<SOS> before his departure , the count went to haydée 's apartments , told her his intention , and resigned everything to her care . <EOS>	69.6133632670411
<SOS> albert was punctual . <EOS>	65.16577053878267
<SOS> the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity , of which morcerf had formed no previous idea . <EOS>	74.73151720996232
<SOS> `` truly , '' said monte cristo , `` with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour , and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission , so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active , it is impossible to move ; i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses ; do i not , ali ? '' <EOS>	105.9902441967952
<SOS> the count put his head out of the window and whistled , and the horses appeared to fly . <EOS>	89.4802953264441
<SOS> the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement , and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor . <EOS>	74.48733515590891
<SOS> ali , smiling , repeated the sound , grasped the reins with a firm hand , and spurred his horses , whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze . <EOS>	76.22859770755113
<SOS> this child of the desert was in his element , and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared , in the cloud of dust he raised , like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane . <EOS>	81.51473202982017
<SOS> `` i never knew till now the delight of speed , '' said morcerf , and the last cloud disappeared from his brow ; `` but where the devil do you get such horses ? <EOS>	80.57038225346103
<SOS> are they made to order ? '' <EOS>	81.81366876008178
<SOS> `` precisely , '' said the count ; `` six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness . <EOS>	81.52368975886743
<SOS> the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny ; they are all entirely black , with the exception of a star upon the forehead . '' <EOS>	71.63396814662177
<SOS> `` that is perfectly admirable ; but what do you do , count , with all these horses ? '' <EOS>	91.50881079496489

<SOS> `` but you are not always travelling . '' <EOS>	77.3849685078055
<SOS> `` when i no longer require them , bertuccio will sell them , and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale . '' <EOS>	117.72477432146675
<SOS> `` but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them . '' <EOS>	57.43273974588251
<SOS> `` then he will sell them to some eastern vizier , who will empty his coffers to purchase them , and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects . '' <EOS>	108.85549145009621
<SOS> `` count , may i suggest one idea to you ? '' <EOS>	75.30995992325735
<SOS> `` certainly . '' <EOS>	82.54343522017267
<SOS> `` it is that , next to you , bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe . '' <EOS>	68.60727919960874
<SOS> `` you are mistaken , viscount ; i believe he has not a franc in his possession . '' <EOS>	90.77687867008973
<SOS> `` then he must be a wonder . <EOS>	62.41249708598369
<SOS> my dear count , if you tell me many more marvellous things , i warn you i shall not believe them . '' <EOS>	91.10400470035418
<SOS> `` i countenance nothing that is marvellous , m. albert . <EOS>	103.43405947383248
<SOS> tell me , why does a steward rob his master ? '' <EOS>	72.91829369841864
<SOS> `` because , i suppose , it is his nature to do so , for the love of robbing . '' <EOS>	67.86602339273963
<SOS> `` you are mistaken ; it is because he has a wife and family , and ambitious desires for himself and them . <EOS>	88.46368084604684
<SOS> also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation , and wishes to provide for the future . <EOS>	84.95823654243382
<SOS> now , m. bertuccio is alone in the world ; he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it ; he is sure never to leave my service . '' <EOS>	102.16548296867879
<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	84.9383598559759
<SOS> `` because i should never get a better . '' <EOS>	80.36922195590907
<SOS> `` probabilities are deceptive . '' <EOS>	73.9105348876748
<SOS> `` but i deal in certainties ; he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death . '' <EOS>	81.54191457772309
<SOS> `` do you possess that right over bertuccio ? '' <EOS>	85.43818380950243
<SOS> `` yes . '' <EOS>	72.99065767369453
<SOS> there are words which close a conversation with an iron door ; such was the count 's `` yes . '' <EOS>	103.71242481837035
<SOS> the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity ; the thirty two horses , dispersed over seven stages , brought them to their destination in eight hours . <EOS>	58.0414240555967
<SOS> at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park . <EOS>	84.48690115838541
<SOS> the porter was in attendance ; he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count 's approach . <EOS>	112.90997647051738
<SOS> at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments , where a bath and supper were prepared . <EOS>	57.06761375696654
<SOS> the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him ; baptistin , who rode in front , attended the count . <EOS>	72.2171158893164
<SOS> albert bathed , took his supper , and went to bed . <EOS>	123.11266129295387
<SOS> all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf . <EOS>	83.52084938905772
<SOS> on rising , he went to his window , which opened on a terrace , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest . <EOS>	108.37897512851559
<SOS> in a creek lay a little sloop , with a narrow keel and high masts , bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or , on a sea azure , with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary , the mount rendered by our lord 's passion more precious than gold , and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy ; or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage 's past life . <EOS>	62.56693518896654
<SOS> around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village , like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen . <EOS>	85.90129801604965
<SOS> there , as in every spot where monte cristo stopped , if but for two days , luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease . <EOS>	68.72359515134504
<SOS> albert found in his anteroom two guns , with all the accoutrements for hunting ; a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits , since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing . <EOS>	95.5568243837535
<SOS> the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled . <EOS>	76.13139720572455
<SOS> they killed a dozen pheasants in the park , as many trout in the stream , dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean , and took tea in the library . <EOS>	80.87538100381626
<SOS> towards the evening of the third day . <EOS>	70.2147678174232
<SOS> albert , completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo , was sleeping in an armchair near the window , while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house , when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up . <EOS>	78.62932609383623
<SOS> he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre , whom he had not brought , that he might not inconvenience monte cristo . <EOS>	100.75636055577093
<SOS> < num > m `` florentin here ! '' <EOS>	86.16354727357032
<SOS> cried he , starting up ; `` is my mother ill ? '' <EOS>	65.62344064434218
<SOS> and he hastened to the door . <EOS>	64.98029238672439
<SOS> monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet , who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket , containing a newspaper and a letter . <EOS>	83.74031164248808
<SOS> `` from whom is this ? '' <EOS>	91.37137712439385
<SOS> said he eagerly . <EOS>	63.49542476101815
<SOS> `` from m. beauchamp , '' replied florentin . <EOS>	99.4627871967347
<SOS> `` did he send you ? '' <EOS>	78.14192224269891
<SOS> `` yes , sir ; he sent for me to his house , gave me money for my journey , procured a horse , and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you , i have come in fifteen hours . '' <EOS>	83.24886039600514
<SOS> albert opened the letter with fear , uttered a shriek on reading the first line , and seized the paper . <EOS>	82.64245956299487
<SOS> his sight was dimmed , his legs sank under him , and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him . <EOS>	89.54850212392728
<SOS> `` poor young man , '' said monte cristo in a low voice ; `` it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation . '' <EOS>	77.27876811133635
<SOS> meanwhile albert had revived , and , continuing to read , he threw back his head , saying : `` florentin , is your horse fit to return immediately ? '' <EOS>	78.28093495675539
<SOS> `` it is a poor , lame post horse . '' <EOS>	79.62561611182828
<SOS> `` in what state was the house when you left ? '' <EOS>	97.1250205920186
<SOS> `` all was quiet , but on returning from m. beauchamp 's , i found madame in tears ; she had sent for me to know when you would return . <EOS>	115.95837041089375
<SOS> i told her my orders from m. beauchamp ; she first extended her arms to prevent me , but after a moment 's reflection , 'yes , go , florentin , ' said she , 'and may he come quickly . ' '' <EOS>	83.93578321068979
<SOS> `` yes , my mother , '' said albert , `` i will return , and woe to the infamous wretch ! <EOS>	119.09805492716342
<SOS> but first of all i must get there . '' <EOS>	59.76502692653019
<SOS> he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo . <EOS>	88.22799378598803
<SOS> five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance . <EOS>	98.28724837700112
<SOS> his voice had become rough and hoarse ; his face was furrowed with wrinkles ; his eyes burned under the blue veined lids , and he tottered like a drunken man . <EOS>	90.68584763991943
<SOS> `` count , '' said he , `` i thank you for your hospitality , which i would gladly have enjoyed longer ; but i must return to paris . '' <EOS>	76.2344742997536
<SOS> `` what has happened ? '' <EOS>	55.89000988283122
<SOS> `` a great misfortune , more important to me than life . <EOS>	65.0364369427966
<SOS> do n't question me , i beg of you , but lend me a horse . '' <EOS>	63.08632209554612
<SOS> `` my stables are at your command , viscount ; but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback . <EOS>	79.24803481141166
<SOS> take a post chaise or a carriage . '' <EOS>	64.63111104330906
<SOS> `` no , it would delay me , and i need the fatigue you warn me of ; it will do me good . '' <EOS>	95.33764290038033
<SOS> albert reeled as if he had been shot , and fell on a chair near the door . <EOS>	63.867191044357746
<SOS> monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion ; he was at the window , calling : `` ali , a horse for m. de morcerf quick ! <EOS>	80.67462150210389
<SOS> he is in a hurry ! '' <EOS>	75.82174700937087
<SOS> < num > m these words restored albert ; he darted from the room , followed by the count . <EOS>	93.39424389996583
<SOS> `` thank you ! '' <EOS>	79.84716336482667
<SOS> cried he , throwing himself on his horse . <EOS>	69.60830054377949
<SOS> `` return as soon as you can , florentin . <EOS>	75.38368043028868
<SOS> must i use any password to procure a horse ? '' <EOS>	110.43968424445667
<SOS> `` only dismount ; another will be immediately saddled . '' <EOS>	100.87836167056221
<SOS> albert hesitated a moment . <EOS>	96.10905099517538
<SOS> `` you may think my departure strange and foolish , '' said the young man ; `` you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one . <EOS>	53.98232287964595
<SOS> read that , '' said he , `` when i am gone , that you may not be witness of my anger . '' <EOS>	60.32092548724187
<SOS> while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse , which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus , and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow . <EOS>	116.97981811817579
<SOS> the count watched him with a feeling of compassion , and when he had completely disappeared , read as follows : `` the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l'impartial , who not only surrendered the castle of yanina , but sold his benefactor to the turks , styled himself truly at that time fernand , as our esteemed contemporary states ; but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name . <EOS>	65.58378352390655
<SOS> he now calls himself the count of morcerf , and ranks among the peers . '' <EOS>	118.49966913794528
<SOS> thus the terrible secret , which beauchamp had so generously destroyed , appeared again like an armed phantom ; and another paper , deriving its information from some malicious source , had published two days after albert 's departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy . <EOS>	111.05962821748982
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	70.78408969785973
<SOS> the trial at eight o'clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp 's door . <EOS>	65.03765004365681
<SOS> the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once . <EOS>	75.6013460070125
<SOS> beauchamp was in his bath . <EOS>	71.49991162080273
<SOS> `` here i am , '' albert said . <EOS>	63.201478440036084
<SOS> `` well , my poor friend , '' replied beauchamp , `` i expected you . '' <EOS>	87.0877568946336
<SOS> `` i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance . <EOS>	61.89020766728423
<SOS> your having sent for me is another proof of your affection . <EOS>	111.77325935530251
<SOS> so , without losing time , tell me , have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds ? '' <EOS>	70.0526951419801
<SOS> `` i think i have some clew . '' <EOS>	90.2987355419657
<SOS> `` but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot . '' <EOS>	92.22664756993888
<SOS> beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man , who was overwhelmed with shame and grief , the following facts . <EOS>	75.07243915390544
<SOS> two days previously , the article had appeared in another paper besides l'impartial , and , what was more serious , one that was well known as a government paper . <EOS>	91.45438696346133
<SOS> beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph . <EOS>	81.63996825472013
<SOS> he sent immediately for a cabriolet , and hastened to the publisher 's office . <EOS>	82.30457293497301
<SOS> although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper , beauchamp as it sometimes , we may say often , happens was his intimate friend . <EOS>	75.64644703429971
<SOS> the editor was reading , with apparent delight , a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar , probably a composition of his own . <EOS>	93.27578319757279
<SOS> `` ah , pardieu ! `` <EOS>	74.6659872557838
<SOS> said beauchamp , `` with the paper in your hand , my friend , i need not tell you the cause of my visit . '' <EOS>	105.72719474385364
<SOS> `` are you interested in the sugar question ? '' <EOS>	81.43180929288046
<SOS> asked the editor of the ministerial paper . <EOS>	86.75737168090328
<SOS> `` no , '' replied beauchamp , `` i have not considered the question ; a totally different subject interests me . '' <EOS>	81.28112569931227
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	97.49596571699631
<SOS> `` the article relative to morcerf . '' <EOS>	70.80409894117811
<SOS> `` indeed ? <EOS>	89.0630420260173
<SOS> is it not a curious affair ? '' <EOS>	62.960699828258655
<SOS> `` so curious , that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character . '' <EOS>	91.09002347260866
<SOS> `` not at all ; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs , and we are quite sure m. de morcerf will not raise his voice against us ; besides , it is rendering a service to one 's country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them . '' <EOS>	116.81579507849149
<SOS> beauchamp was thunderstruck . <EOS>	90.12504089586484
<SOS> `` who , then , has so correctly informed you ? '' <EOS>	81.51738151916848
<SOS> asked he ; `` for my paper , which gave the first information on the subject , has been obliged to stop for want of proof ; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m. de morcerf , as he is a peer of france , and we are of the opposition . '' <EOS>	93.45262019317725
<SOS> `` oh , that is very simple ; we have not sought to scandalize . <EOS>	96.3243144254407
<SOS> this news was brought to us . <EOS>	95.20723579843548
<SOS> a man arrived yesterday from yanina , bringing a formidable array of documents ; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article , he told us it should be inserted in some other paper . '' <EOS>	88.57646376350844
<SOS> beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit , and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf . <EOS>	88.69816416936982
<SOS> but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars , as the events had transpired after the messenger 's departure ; namely , that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly . <EOS>	80.40577233256623
<SOS> everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues . <EOS>	80.85567678981994
<SOS> some were perusing the article , others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more . <EOS>	79.30602052253064
<SOS> the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues . <EOS>	83.40374290785374
<SOS> like all upstarts , he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position . <EOS>	76.67662611441742
<SOS> the true nobility laughed at him , the talented repelled him , and the honorable instinctively despised him . <EOS>	92.11203948670747
<SOS> he was , in fact , in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice ; the finger of god once pointed at him , everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry . <EOS>	79.35143782363123
<SOS> the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news . <EOS>	68.63510787501659
<SOS> he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article , and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse . <EOS>	68.38922940628227
<SOS> he arrived at his usual hour , with a proud look and insolent demeanor ; he alighted , passed through the corridors , and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues . <EOS>	80.78214529979027
<SOS> < num > m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered . <EOS>	93.27279714766287
<SOS> everyone held the accusing paper , but , as usual , no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack . <EOS>	101.32401253448025
<SOS> at length an honorable peer , morcerf 's acknowledged enemy , ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived . <EOS>	86.8152521019696
<SOS> there was an impressive silence ; morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency . <EOS>	93.85955454721635
<SOS> the count did not notice the introduction , in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house ; but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand , he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him . <EOS>	95.43695080100082
<SOS> moral wounds have this peculiarity , they may be hidden , but they never close ; always painful , always ready to bleed when touched , they remain fresh and open in the heart . <EOS>	119.82296755728352
<SOS> the article having been read during the painful hush that followed , a universal shudder pervaded the assembly , and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks . <EOS>	104.12481335435179
<SOS> he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case ; it was the honor of m. de morcerf , and that of the whole house , he proposed to defend , by provoking a debate on personal questions , which are always such painful themes of discussion . <EOS>	67.66422826728689
<SOS> he concluded by calling for an investigation , which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread , and restore m. de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion . <EOS>	106.08987310246853
<SOS> morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly . <EOS>	100.34827869754278
<SOS> this timidity , which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt , conciliated some in his favor ; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred . <EOS>	79.51032688122285
<SOS> the president put it to the vote , and it was decided that the investigation should take place . <EOS>	88.40295752856478
<SOS> the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence . <EOS>	100.19492443495812
<SOS> morcerf 's courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow . <EOS>	68.76036379056443
<SOS> `` my lords , '' answered he , `` it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me , and , doubtless , hidden in obscurity ; it is immediately , and by a thunderbolt , that i must repel the flash of lightning which , for a moment , startled me . <EOS>	67.64038238650761
<SOS> oh , that i could , instead of taking up this defence , shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth . '' <EOS>	79.87357668615074
<SOS> these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused . <EOS>	60.66301936310462
<SOS> `` i demand , then , that the examination shall take place as soon as possible , and i will furnish the house with all necessary information . '' <EOS>	100.84286742197492
<SOS> `` what day do you fix ? '' <EOS>	60.06318694151462
<SOS> asked the president . <EOS>	74.65259200507361
<SOS> `` today i am at your service , '' replied the count . <EOS>	96.86777707332726
<SOS> the president rang the bell . <EOS>	93.8255625416834
<SOS> `` does the house approve that the examination should take place today ? '' <EOS>	55.50818123032788
<SOS> < num > m `` yes , '' was the unanimous answer . <EOS>	72.13234943933409
<SOS> a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf . <EOS>	94.75274761872697
<SOS> the investigation would begin at eight o'clock that evening in the committee room , and if postponement were necessary , the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour . <EOS>	70.62448502477467
<SOS> morcerf asked leave to retire ; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm , which his sagacity had foreseen . <EOS>	77.15278898586921
<SOS> beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated ; his story , however , had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things . <EOS>	86.88230632755334
<SOS> albert listened , trembling now with hope , then with anger , and then again with shame , for from beauchamp 's confidence he knew his father was guilty , and he asked himself how , since he was guilty , he could prove his innocence . <EOS>	96.01351966761078
<SOS> beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative . <EOS>	77.86962171306854
<SOS> `` what next ? '' <EOS>	73.22933132876838
<SOS> asked albert . <EOS>	94.2889508917936
<SOS> `` what next ? <EOS>	69.09238488463023
<SOS> my friend , you impose a painful task on me . <EOS>	87.58057290307417

<SOS> `` absolutely ; and rather from your lips than another 's . '' <EOS>	90.53674288585427
<SOS> `` muster up all your courage , then , for never have you required it more . '' <EOS>	80.7089075766854
<SOS> albert passed his hand over his forehead , as if to try his strength , as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword . <EOS>	73.01243481540116
<SOS> he thought himself strong enough , for he mistook fever for energy . <EOS>	75.47523020597814
<SOS> `` go on , '' said he . <EOS>	86.20250434725898
<SOS> `` the evening arrived ; all paris was in expectation . <EOS>	67.57533882322242
<SOS> many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him ; many others said he would not appear ; while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels ; and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport . <EOS>	98.69669690976404
<SOS> i used all my influence with one of the committee , a young peer of my acquaintance , to get admission to one of the galleries . <EOS>	64.97504395137886
<SOS> he called for me at seven o'clock , and , before anyone had arrived , asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box . <EOS>	103.44461918400016
<SOS> i was concealed by a column , and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place . <EOS>	56.974678008016426
<SOS> at eight o'clock all were in their places , and m. de morcerf entered at the last stroke . <EOS>	91.96539075271886
<SOS> he held some papers in his hand ; his countenance was calm , and his step firm , and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform , which was buttoned completely up to the chin . <EOS>	91.42686211698609
<SOS> his presence produced a good effect . <EOS>	58.66473282795754
<SOS> the committee was made up of liberals , several of whom came forward to shake hands with him . '' <EOS>	90.19270033631761
<SOS> albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars , but gratitude mingled with his sorrow : he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked . <EOS>	73.01021067375022
<SOS> `` at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president . <EOS>	92.93044541809077
<SOS> 'you are at liberty to speak , m. de morcerf , ' said the president , as he unsealed the letter ; and the count began his defence , i assure you , albert , in a most eloquent and skilful manner . <EOS>	83.12429425666339
<SOS> he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . <EOS>	72.91666573061691
<SOS> he produced the ring , his mark of authority , with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters , and which the latter had given him , that he might , on his return at any hour of the day or night , gain access to the presence , even in the harem . <EOS>	114.95525157062129
<SOS> unfortunately , the negotiation failed , and when he returned to defend his benefactor , he was dead . <EOS>	71.74911426218388
<SOS> 'but , ' said the count , 'so great was ali pasha 's confidence , that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care . ' '' <EOS>	82.75523581278134
<SOS> albert started on hearing these words ; the history of haydée recurred to him , and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring , and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave . <EOS>	67.9777994599042
<SOS> `` and what effect did this discourse produce ? '' <EOS>	72.51925619534943
<SOS> anxiously inquired albert . <EOS>	99.61499181224433
<SOS> `` i acknowledge it affected me , and , indeed , all the committee also , '' said beauchamp . <EOS>	89.87739838120825
<SOS> `` meanwhile , the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him ; but the first lines aroused his attention ; he read them again and again , and fixing his eyes on m. de morcerf , 'count , ' said he , 'you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care ? ' <EOS>	95.5786187209925
<SOS> 'yes , sir , ' replied morcerf ; 'but in that , like all the rest , misfortune pursued me . <EOS>	105.86322129500607

<SOS> 'alas , no , monsieur , ' replied the count ; 'all those who surrounded the vizier , or who knew me at his court , are either dead or gone away , i know not where . <EOS>	114.83064706429357
<SOS> i believe that i alone , of all my countrymen , survived that dreadful war . <EOS>	72.08412997465825
<SOS> i have only the letters of ali tepelini , which i have placed before you ; the ring , a token of his good will , which is here ; and , lastly , the most convincing proof i can offer , after an anonymous attack , and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life .

<SOS> `` a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly ; and at this moment , albert , had nothing more transpired , your father 's cause had been gained . <EOS>	68.0242453322893

<SOS> m. de morcerf turned pale , and clenched his hands on the papers he held . <EOS>	64.85672279179938
<SOS> the committee decided to hear the letter ; the count was thoughtful and silent . <EOS>	79.50689316331493
<SOS> the president read : `` 'mr . <EOS>	100.20016171130038

<SOS> 'proceed , ' was heard on all sides . <EOS>	61.228510943652815
<SOS> the president resumed : `` ' i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha . <EOS>	75.59305979888104

<SOS> 'is there anyone in the lobby ? ' <EOS>	68.37337491481912

<SOS> it was evident , from her figure and the perfumes she had about her , that she was young and fastidious in her tastes , but that was all . <EOS>	74.83332245190384
<SOS> the president requested her to throw aside her veil , and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume , and was remarkably beautiful . '' <EOS>	63.41249093864778

<SOS> her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death . <EOS>	95.90367853098903
<SOS> to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious , that the interest they had felt for the count 's safety became now quite a secondary matter . <EOS>	105.0892968260834
<SOS> the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady ; but she declined availing herself of it . <EOS>	105.95970857480965
<SOS> as for the count , he had fallen on his chair ; it was evident that his legs refused to support him . <EOS>	73.41185568088045

<SOS> `` i accuse no one , sir , '' said danglars ; `` i relate , and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you . '' <EOS>	73.48367530209634
<SOS> `` does the count know what answer you received ? '' <EOS>	89.26400326243764
<SOS> `` yes ; i showed it to him . '' <EOS>	76.90043105427398
<SOS> `` did he know my father 's christian name was fernand , and his family name mondego ? '' <EOS>	91.88678350376117
<SOS> `` yes , i had told him that long since , and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances , and perhaps less . <EOS>	113.46455516148856
<SOS> when , the day after the arrival of this answer , your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter 's hand for you , i decidedly refused him , but without any explanation or exposure . <EOS>	88.02496737382604
<SOS> in short , why should i have any more to do with the affair ? <EOS>	89.25145717171218
<SOS> how did the honor or disgrace of m. de morcerf affect me ? <EOS>	87.96587035548347
<SOS> it neither increased nor decreased my income . '' <EOS>	64.27819038660672
<SOS> albert felt the blood mounting to his brow ; there was no doubt upon the subject . <EOS>	95.58286128940469
<SOS> danglars defended himself with the baseness , but at the same time with the assurance , of a man who speaks the truth , at least in part , if not wholly not for conscience ' sake , but through fear . <EOS>	67.47472202336056
<SOS> besides , what was morcerf seeking ? <EOS>	63.529359880033745
<SOS> it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty ; it was a man who would answer for the offence , whether trifling or serious ; it was a man who would fight , and it was evident danglars would not fight . <EOS>	91.66045052431723
<SOS> in addition to this , everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection . <EOS>	94.87020260246639
<SOS> monte cristo knew everything , as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha ; and , knowing everything , he had advised danglars to write to yanina . <EOS>	100.3610802382741
<SOS> the answer known , he had yielded to albert 's wish to be introduced to haydée , and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali , and had not opposed haydée 's recital ( but having , doubtless , warned the young girl , in the few romaic words he spoke to her , not to implicate morcerf 's father ) . <EOS>	83.85662795558018
<SOS> besides , had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father 's name before haydée ? <EOS>	88.67363160372354
<SOS> lastly , he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near . <EOS>	91.64267547506182
<SOS> there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged ; monte cristo then was in league with his father 's enemies . <EOS>	101.03797157502967
<SOS> albert took beauchamp aside , and communicated these ideas to him . <EOS>	96.19725970168766
<SOS> `` you are right , '' said the latter ; `` m. danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair , and it is of m. de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation . '' <EOS>	59.641883781633716
<SOS> albert turned . <EOS>	80.91901055548648
<SOS> `` sir , '' said he to danglars , `` understand that i do not take a final leave of you ; i must ascertain if your insinuations are just , and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	81.16102283465796
<SOS> he bowed to the banker , and went out with beauchamp , without appearing to notice cavalcanti . <EOS>	74.42106437448737
<SOS> danglars accompanied him to the door , where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf . <EOS>	103.71717056115304

<SOS> the insult at the banker 's door beauchamp stopped morcerf . <EOS>	62.08848523031398
<SOS> `` listen , '' said he ; `` just now i told you it was of m. de monte cristo you must demand an explanation . '' <EOS>	84.4418683465436
<SOS> `` yes ; and we are going to his house . '' <EOS>	84.1304850317168
<SOS> `` reflect , morcerf , one moment before you go . '' <EOS>	80.69801844819543
<SOS> `` on what shall i reflect ? '' <EOS>	101.41628891872622

<SOS> `` are you quite decided , albert ? '' <EOS>	87.67599834047054
<SOS> `` yes ; let us go . '' <EOS>	84.11452006684038
<SOS> `` but do you think we shall find the count at home ? '' <EOS>	70.41613204216749
<SOS> `` he intended returning some hours after me , and doubtless he is now at home . '' <EOS>	82.83550950397519

<SOS> < num > champs élysées . <EOS>	99.56756795973845
<SOS> beauchamp wished to go in alone , but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels . <EOS>	90.14281771240647
<SOS> the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes ; he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf . <EOS>	97.20864249994037
<SOS> albert sprang from the porter 's lodge to the steps . <EOS>	69.49516899107564
<SOS> he was received by baptistin . <EOS>	86.56359310707512
<SOS> the count had , indeed , just arrived , but he was in his bath , and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted . <EOS>	74.08955810616136
<SOS> `` but after his bath ? '' <EOS>	82.41081181886791
<SOS> asked morcerf . <EOS>	89.6384613925624
<SOS> `` my master will go to dinner . '' <EOS>	91.44786431985533

<SOS> `` quite , sir ; my master has ordered his horses at eight o'clock precisely . '' <EOS>	114.56052704431478
<SOS> `` very good , '' replied albert ; `` that is all i wished to know . '' <EOS>	80.79205809908511
<SOS> then , turning towards beauchamp , `` if you have anything to attend to , beauchamp , do it directly ; if you have any appointment for this evening , defer it till tomorrow . <EOS>	89.14912934214631
<SOS> i depend on you to accompany me to the opera ; and if you can , bring château renaud with you . '' <EOS>	62.86152269203307
<SOS> beauchamp availed himself of albert 's permission , and left him , promising to call for him at a quarter before eight . <EOS>	95.39169744265084
<SOS> on his return home , albert expressed his wish to franz debray , and morrel , to see them at the opera that evening . <EOS>	56.41864601343469
<SOS> then he went to see his mother , who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone , and had kept her room . <EOS>	71.62028935998958
<SOS> he found her in bed , overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation . <EOS>	82.44894870575186
<SOS> the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès ; she pressed her son 's hand and sobbed aloud , but her tears relieved her . <EOS>	72.00833520799333
<SOS> albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother 's bed . <EOS>	78.34518267985761
<SOS> it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker . <EOS>	102.27132142109717
<SOS> `` my dear mother , '' said he , `` do you know if m. de morcerf has any enemy ? '' <EOS>	105.50645627069407
<SOS> mercédès started ; she noticed that the young man did not say `` my father . '' <EOS>	86.06166551272096
<SOS> `` my son , '' she said , `` persons in the count 's situation have many secret enemies . <EOS>	65.86139131181375

<SOS> `` why do you say so ? '' <EOS>	89.29790664799025
<SOS> `` because , for instance , you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave , that m. de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house . '' <EOS>	66.3274941743256
<SOS> mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm . <EOS>	69.72602159092426
<SOS> `` m. de monte cristo ! '' <EOS>	112.08025736274057

<SOS> < num > m `` you know , mother , m. de monte cristo is almost an oriental , and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies . '' <EOS>	87.52438680040461
<SOS> `` do you say m. de monte cristo is our enemy ? '' <EOS>	79.84486453464568

<SOS> `` who told you so ? <EOS>	86.46830705606116

<SOS> oh , i entreat you , my son , if you had entertained such an idea , dispel it ; and my counsel to you nay , my prayer is to retain his friendship . '' <EOS>	91.22959236866937
<SOS> `` mother , '' replied the young man , `` you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man . '' <EOS>	103.23273752937563
<SOS> `` i ? '' <EOS>	79.33043629731313
<SOS> said mercédès , blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale , and again becoming paler than ever . <EOS>	71.38600159301794
<SOS> `` yes , doubtless ; and is it not that he may never do us any harm ? '' <EOS>	81.40391202928848
<SOS> mercédès shuddered , and , fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze , `` you speak strangely , '' said she to albert , `` and you appear to have some singular prejudices . <EOS>	90.91575384581654
<SOS> what has the count done ? <EOS>	79.66845738757877
<SOS> three days since you were with him in normandy ; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend . '' <EOS>	80.98599729389917
<SOS> an ironical smile passed over albert 's lips . <EOS>	86.4062049342095
<SOS> mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all ; but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears . <EOS>	102.04579272445804
<SOS> albert was silent ; an instant after , the countess resumed : `` you came to inquire after my health ; i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well . <EOS>	80.03732047131726
<SOS> you should install yourself here , and cheer my solitude . <EOS>	98.07647390769442
<SOS> i do not wish to be left alone . '' <EOS>	83.53115763191354
<SOS> `` mother , '' said the young man , `` you know how gladly i would obey your wish , but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening . '' <EOS>	78.32529273207965
<SOS> `` well , '' replied mercédès , sighing , `` go , albert ; i will not make you a slave to your filial piety . '' <EOS>	58.173416047663515
<SOS> albert pretended he did not hear , bowed to his mother , and quitted her . <EOS>	117.99058084227194
<SOS> scarcely had he shut her door , when mercédès called a confidential servant , and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening , and to come and tell her immediately what he observed . <EOS>	79.40975118473531
<SOS> then she rang for her lady 's maid , and , weak as she was , she dressed , in order to be ready for whatever might happen . <EOS>	94.1823893358605
<SOS> the footman 's mission was an easy one . <EOS>	91.54233837407128
<SOS> albert went to his room , and dressed with unusual care . <EOS>	116.09338746783529
<SOS> at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived ; he had seen château renaud , who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised . <EOS>	101.2298608423321
<SOS> both got into albert 's coupé ; and , as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going , he called aloud , `` to the opera . '' <EOS>	113.40560005871839
<SOS> in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance . <EOS>	107.03927377732886
<SOS> < num > m château renaud was at his post ; apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances , he required no explanation from albert . <EOS>	107.06902784674963
<SOS> the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him , and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion . <EOS>	88.54547350938618
<SOS> debray was not yet come , but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera . <EOS>	93.96831321308936
<SOS> albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up . <EOS>	81.89991994704668
<SOS> he hoped to meet with m. de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs . <EOS>	60.064200061738575
<SOS> the bell summoned him to his seat , and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp . <EOS>	78.31923668645419
<SOS> but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns , which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act . <EOS>	79.27274064423668
<SOS> at last , as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time , at the beginning of the second act the door opened , and monte cristo entered , dressed in black , and , leaning over the front of the box , looked around the pit . <EOS>	87.00752723321335
<SOS> morrel followed him , and looked also for his sister and brother in law ; he soon discovered them in another box , and kissed his hand to them . <EOS>	72.02474950989412
<SOS> the count , in his survey of the pit , encountered a pale face and threatening eyes , which evidently sought to gain his attention . <EOS>	91.6596306381346
<SOS> he recognized albert , but thought it better not to notice him , as he looked so angry and discomposed . <EOS>	81.11239070219125
<SOS> without communicating his thoughts to his companion , he sat down , drew out his opera glass , and looked another way . <EOS>	86.67116361351671
<SOS> although apparently not noticing albert , he did not , however , lose sight of him , and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act , he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends . <EOS>	88.40975331618546
<SOS> then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes , and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him . <EOS>	97.52683657158236
<SOS> he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel , but he was well prepared for what might happen . <EOS>	79.2242432916693
<SOS> the door opened , and monte cristo , turning round , saw albert , pale and trembling , followed by beauchamp and château renaud . <EOS>	67.35836862536101
<SOS> `` well , '' cried he , with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world , `` my cavalier has attained his object . <EOS>	98.16463273678787
<SOS> good evening , m. de morcerf . '' <EOS>	77.82100207024489
<SOS> the countenance of this man , who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings , expressed the most perfect cordiality . <EOS>	75.33210390261816
<SOS> morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount , in which , without assigning any reason , he begged him to go to the opera , but he understood that something terrible was brooding . <EOS>	104.23942341441817
<SOS> `` we are not come here , sir , to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness , or false professions of friendship , '' said albert , `` but to demand an explanation . '' <EOS>	98.18434120277556
<SOS> the young man 's trembling voice was scarcely audible . <EOS>	75.09360729339124
<SOS> `` an explanation at the opera ? '' <EOS>	53.13704182769451
<SOS> said the count , with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good . <EOS>	88.72403391376385
<SOS> `` little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians , i should not have thought this the place for such a demand . '' <EOS>	69.84226393958822
<SOS> `` still , if people will shut themselves up , '' said albert , `` and can not be seen because they are bathing , dining , or asleep , we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen . '' <EOS>	108.62878628477202
<SOS> `` i am not difficult of access , sir ; for yesterday , if my memory does not deceive me , you were at my house . '' <EOS>	101.1820617638092
<SOS> `` yesterday i was at your house , sir , '' said the young man ; `` because then i knew not who you were . '' <EOS>	80.84666257329341
<SOS> in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby . <EOS>	86.38127427939425
<SOS> thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation . <EOS>	80.32505585889342
<SOS> `` where are you come from , sir ? `` <EOS>	75.01416159557398
<SOS> said monte cristo `` you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses . '' <EOS>	90.80879709035526
<SOS> `` provided i understand your perfidy , sir , and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged , i shall be reasonable enough , '' said albert furiously . <EOS>	86.92971619494313
<SOS> `` i do not understand you , sir , '' replied monte cristo ; `` and if i did , your tone is too high . <EOS>	90.69852949883027
<SOS> i am at home here , and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another 's . <EOS>	86.91721600425257
<SOS> leave the box , sir ! '' <EOS>	94.99309662226366
<SOS> monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity . <EOS>	107.66780459998145
<SOS> `` ah , i shall know how to make you leave your home ! '' <EOS>	58.10153077082781
<SOS> replied albert , clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove , which monte cristo did not lose sight of . <EOS>	86.90625673683218
<SOS> `` well , well , '' said monte cristo quietly , `` i see you wish to quarrel with me ; but i would give you one piece of advice , which you will do well to keep in mind . <EOS>	67.07145505162862
<SOS> it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge . <EOS>	96.60490251038999
<SOS> display is not becoming to everyone , m. de morcerf . '' <EOS>	79.8973076512822
<SOS> at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene . <EOS>	77.15247852510977
<SOS> they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day . <EOS>	74.88105944515523
<SOS> albert understood the allusion in a moment , and was about to throw his glove at the count , when morrel seized his hand , while beauchamp and château renaud , fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge , held him back . <EOS>	80.92350932553462
<SOS> but monte cristo , without rising , and leaning forward in his chair , merely stretched out his arm and , taking the damp , crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man : `` sir , '' said he in a solemn tone , `` i consider your glove thrown , and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet . <EOS>	87.76344733571383
<SOS> now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door . '' <EOS>	114.82031856128627
<SOS> wild , almost unconscious , and with eyes inflamed , albert stepped back , and morrel closed the door . <EOS>	92.60745752183551
<SOS> monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened ; his face was like marble , and his heart was like bronze . <EOS>	73.28147558677662
<SOS> morrel whispered , `` what have you done to him ? '' <EOS>	111.09544789978241
<SOS> `` i ? <EOS>	77.9334351684494
<SOS> nothing at least personally , '' said monte cristo . <EOS>	118.53415616653386
<SOS> `` but there must be some cause for this strange scene . '' <EOS>	97.29976642553574
<SOS> `` the count of morcerf 's adventure exasperates the young man . '' <EOS>	106.49257408674781

<SOS> these were pistols of an especial pattern , which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room . <EOS>	79.02422424004585

<SOS> the count , fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved , called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred . <EOS>	103.48903573201943
<SOS> `` revenge yourself , then , edmond , '' cried the poor mother ; `` but let your vengeance fall on the culprits , on him , on me , but not on my son ! '' <EOS>	97.6312789231868
<SOS> `` it is written in the good book , '' said monte cristo , `` that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation . <EOS>	90.40016657260927

<SOS> `` have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence ? '' <EOS>	68.14184582124142
<SOS> cried monte cristo , thrusting his hands into his hair ; `` have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival , while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon ? '' <EOS>	56.22005146438238
<SOS> `` no , '' interrupted mercédès , `` but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son . '' <EOS>	92.2782793727364
<SOS> mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish , with an accent of such intense despair , that monte cristo could not restrain a sob . <EOS>	73.26737720512139
<SOS> the lion was daunted ; the avenger was conquered . <EOS>	109.53700164226392
<SOS> `` what do you ask of me ? '' <EOS>	83.88730916105256

<SOS> well , he shall live ! '' <EOS>	71.69094616273503
<SOS> mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo 's eyes ; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously , for , doubtless , god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir . <EOS>	72.66974434484911
<SOS> `` oh , '' said she , seizing the count 's hand and raising it to her lips ; `` oh , thank you , thank you , edmond ! <EOS>	68.7801769016982

<SOS> mercédès shrieked , and sprang towards monte cristo , but , suddenly stopping , `` edmond , '' said she , `` there is a god above us , since you live and since i have seen you again ; i trust to him from my heart . <EOS>	86.27513016372878

<SOS> `` yes , madame , he shall live , '' said monte cristo , surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her . <EOS>	94.70942976673223
<SOS> mercédès extended her hand to the count . <EOS>	81.56325089326403
<SOS> `` edmond , '' said she , and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke , `` how noble it is of you , how great the action you have just performed , how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her , alas , i am grown old with grief more than with years , and can not now remind my edmond by a smile , or by a look , of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating . <EOS>	95.01130748761807

<SOS> suppose that the supreme being , after having created the world and fertilized chaos , had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes ; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night then even then , mercédès , you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment . '' <EOS>	80.19501960690847
<SOS> mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment , her admiration , and her gratitude . <EOS>	64.36655330206115
<SOS> monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands , as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts . <EOS>	103.12495833203556
<SOS> `` edmond , '' said mercédès , `` i have but one word more to say to you . '' <EOS>	67.22644357671429
<SOS> the count smiled bitterly . <EOS>	80.2862347202932

<SOS> adieu , then , edmond ; i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again , and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were . <EOS>	103.12891771933197

<SOS> but the count did not answer . <EOS>	92.16019545687952
<SOS> mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him . <EOS>	98.43157880043768
<SOS> the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées , and made monte cristo raise his head . <EOS>	108.87584048173647
<SOS> `` what a fool i was , '' said he , `` not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself ! '' <EOS>	60.36194306516355
<SOS> chapter < num > . <EOS>	62.98596522526452
<SOS> the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo , he fell into profound gloom . <EOS>	81.15803690323017
<SOS> around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped ; his energetic mind slumbered , as the body does after extreme fatigue . <EOS>	72.544818266395
<SOS> `` what ? '' <EOS>	82.546494378593
<SOS> said he to himself , while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out , and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom ; `` what ? <EOS>	101.9832593328679
<SOS> this edifice which i have been so long preparing , which i have reared with so much care and toil , is to be crushed by a single touch , a word , a breath ! <EOS>	95.57383355198752
<SOS> yes , this self , of whom i thought so much , of whom i was so proud , who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d'if , and whom i had succeeded in making so great , will be but a lump of clay tomorrow . <EOS>	95.32337196771549
<SOS> alas , it is not the death of the body i regret ; for is not the destruction of the vital principle , the repose to which everything is tending , to which every unhappy being aspires , is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed , and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon ? <EOS>	63.320704912987196
<SOS> what is death for me ? <EOS>	108.92275130366116
<SOS> one step farther into rest , two , perhaps , into silence . <EOS>	79.22919494258947
<SOS> no , it is not existence , then , that i regret , but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out , so laboriously framed . <EOS>	89.62092629228839
<SOS> providence is now opposed to them , when i most thought it would be propitious . <EOS>	77.75062729993414
<SOS> it is not god 's will that they should be accomplished . <EOS>	102.87766549157456
<SOS> this burden , almost as heavy as a world , which i had raised , and i had thought to bear to the end , was too great for my strength , and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career . <EOS>	85.07527758574076
<SOS> oh , shall i then , again become a fatalist , whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence ? <EOS>	84.38029156675238
<SOS> `` and all this all this , because my heart , which i thought dead , was only sleeping ; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again , because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman 's voice . <EOS>	103.60562931594761
<SOS> `` yet , '' continued the count , becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow , which mercédès had accepted , `` yet , it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength ; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love , or rather delirium . <EOS>	75.6875896592743
<SOS> there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration . <EOS>	67.6312441444649
<SOS> no , she must have conceived some pathetic scene ; she will come and throw herself between us ; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous . '' <EOS>	84.84824833476274
<SOS> the blush of pride mounted to the count 's forehead as this thought passed through his mind . <EOS>	89.69622269466265
<SOS> `` ridiculous ? '' <EOS>	81.50853243473524
<SOS> repeated he ; `` and the ridicule will fall on me . <EOS>	75.47161872125412
<SOS> i ridiculous ? <EOS>	67.28943179781824
<SOS> no , i would rather die . '' <EOS>	75.11679879778035
<SOS> by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day , to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son , the count at last exclaimed : `` folly , folly , folly ! <EOS>	61.836387020906265
<SOS> to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at . <EOS>	64.8787473724408
<SOS> he will never believe that my death was suicide ; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory , and this surely is not vanity , but a justifiable pride , it is important the world should know that i have consented , by my free will , to stop my arm , already raised to strike , and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself . <EOS>	66.0353048931883
<SOS> it must be ; it shall be . '' <EOS>	86.13847053554124
<SOS> seizing a pen , he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk , and wrote at the bottom of the document ( which was no other than his will , made since his arrival in paris ) a sort of codicil , clearly explaining the nature of his death . <EOS>	59.11984999680931
<SOS> `` i do this , oh , my god , '' said he , with his eyes raised to heaven , `` as much for thy honor as for mine . <EOS>	82.25603980422903
<SOS> i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance , and other wretches , like morcerf , danglars , villefort , even morcerf himself , must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy . <EOS>	60.34948233594442

<SOS> while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties , wretched waking dreams of grief , the first rays of morning pierced his windows , and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence . <EOS>	93.50250564329326
<SOS> it was just five o'clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear . <EOS>	99.46171250758469
<SOS> he turned his head , looked around him , and saw no one ; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality . <EOS>	72.87228678002595
<SOS> he arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing room , saw haydée , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back . <EOS>	72.46966649597046
<SOS> she had been standing at the door , to prevent his going out without seeing her , until sleep , which the young can not resist , had overpowered her frame , wearied as she was with watching . <EOS>	67.86032760536794
<SOS> the noise of the door did not awaken her , and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret . <EOS>	83.82856804108752
<SOS> `` she remembered that she had a son , '' said he ; `` and i forgot i had a daughter . '' <EOS>	112.9757990429403
<SOS> then , shaking his head sorrowfully , `` poor haydée , '' said he ; `` she wished to see me , to speak to me ; she has feared or guessed something . <EOS>	64.5038703412191
<SOS> oh , i can not go without taking leave of her ; i can not die without confiding her to someone . '' <EOS>	94.30526574256496
<SOS> he quietly regained his seat , and wrote under the other lines : `` i bequeath to maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , and son of my former patron , pierre morrel , shipowner at marseilles , the sum of twenty millions , a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel , if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness . <EOS>	77.41306736083304

<SOS> this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune , consisting of lands , funds in england , austria , and holland , furniture in my different palaces and houses , and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants , may still amount to sixty millions .

<SOS> `` i am going on a journey , dear child , '' said monte cristo , with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy ; `` and if any misfortune should happen to me `` the count stopped . <EOS>	79.5991317425487
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	78.45350468452476
<SOS> asked the young girl , with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before , and which startled him . <EOS>	77.61445464483118
<SOS> `` well , if any misfortune happen to me , '' replied monte cristo , `` i wish my daughter to be happy . '' <EOS>	83.49018394820467
<SOS> haydée smiled sorrowfully , and shook her head . <EOS>	100.15716959749349
<SOS> `` do you think of dying , my lord ? '' <EOS>	106.35183685339267

<SOS> `` well , if you die , '' said she , `` bequeath your fortune to others , for if you die i shall require nothing ; '' and , taking the paper , she tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the middle of the room . <EOS>	98.41180784623886
<SOS> then , the effort having exhausted her strength , she fell , not asleep this time , but fainting on the floor . <EOS>	70.19675242752027
<SOS> the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms ; and seeing that sweet pale face , those lovely eyes closed , that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless , the idea occurred to him for the first time , that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father . <EOS>	101.72581898649787
<SOS> `` alas , '' murmured he , with intense suffering , `` i might , then , have been happy yet . '' <EOS>	64.28818265145988
<SOS> then he carried haydée to her room , resigned her to the care of her attendants , and returning to his study , which he shut quickly this time , he again copied the destroyed will . <EOS>	80.04425369491885
<SOS> as he was finishing , the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard . <EOS>	68.39725101673905
<SOS> monte cristo approached the window , and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight . <EOS>	95.44976024108935
<SOS> `` good , '' said he ; `` it was time , '' and he sealed his will with three seals . <EOS>	63.30034086984628
<SOS> a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room , and went to open the door himself . <EOS>	118.58554317155614

<SOS> `` morrel , '' said he , `` it is a happy day for me , to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you . <EOS>	76.046605146119

<SOS> monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered , and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate , with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club . <EOS>	86.13191581211376
<SOS> at each shot morrel turned pale . <EOS>	96.93315249278461

<SOS> monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends . <EOS>	62.805490624753986
<SOS> he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door , and maximilian and emmanuel , who had considerately passed forward a few steps , thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within . <EOS>	77.5059339394124
<SOS> as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting . <EOS>	94.43759315470648

<SOS> monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage , and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian . <EOS>	112.11392254898016
<SOS> the latter retained the count 's hand between his . <EOS>	76.09461527529807

<SOS> monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law . <EOS>	94.69736964699845
<SOS> `` maximilian , '' said he , `` are your affections disengaged ? '' <EOS>	118.47930510660859

<SOS> `` to tell the truth , count , if i knew less of you , i should think that you were less brave than you are . '' <EOS>	93.56333350230793

<SOS> `` you need not fear . '' <EOS>	82.86589306793536
<SOS> morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud , who , seeing his intention , came to meet him . <EOS>	80.5000101184786
<SOS> the three young men bowed to each other courteously , if not affably . <EOS>	65.92331739842798
<SOS> `` excuse me , gentlemen , '' said morrel , `` but i do not see m. de morcerf . '' <EOS>	87.16225077243679
<SOS> `` he sent us word this morning , '' replied château renaud , `` that he would meet us on the ground . '' <EOS>	92.64241497052178
<SOS> `` ah , '' said morrel . <EOS>	87.42003450775172
<SOS> beauchamp pulled out his watch . <EOS>	75.93668496211295
<SOS> `` it is only five minutes past eight , '' said he to morrel ; `` there is not much time lost yet . '' <EOS>	91.81530462011145
<SOS> `` oh , i made no allusion of that kind , '' replied morrel . <EOS>	74.12163863467717
<SOS> `` there is a carriage coming , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	76.28519301758872

<SOS> `` you are doubtless provided with pistols , gentlemen ? <EOS>	63.869123423636786

<SOS> `` what chance brings you here , gentlemen ? '' <EOS>	60.48892449156471
<SOS> said château renaud , shaking hands with each of them . <EOS>	86.7313342684581
<SOS> `` because , '' said debray , `` albert sent this morning to request us to come . '' <EOS>	73.62902568525875
<SOS> beauchamp and château renaud exchanged looks of astonishment . <EOS>	84.53003499499337

<SOS> `` yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m. de morcerf , begging me to attend the opera . '' <EOS>	74.54651535077905

<SOS> `` and i also , '' said franz . <EOS>	80.06856955752376
<SOS> `` and we , too , '' added beauchamp and château renaud . <EOS>	86.53685443712895
<SOS> `` having wished you all to witness the challenge , he now wishes you to be present at the combat . '' <EOS>	84.02123613251143
<SOS> `` exactly so , '' said the young men ; `` you have probably guessed right . '' <EOS>	111.2658477369904
<SOS> `` but , after all these arrangements , he does not come himself , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	65.83132178112032
<SOS> `` albert is ten minutes after time . '' <EOS>	86.47780370230053
<SOS> `` there he comes , '' said beauchamp , `` on horseback , at full gallop , followed by a servant . '' <EOS>	86.07746144078376
<SOS> `` how imprudent , '' said château renaud , `` to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols , after all the instructions i had given him . '' <EOS>	104.08690874176396
<SOS> `` and besides , '' said beauchamp , `` with a collar above his cravat , an open coat and white waistcoat ! <EOS>	116.59031407163314
<SOS> why has he not painted a spot upon his heart ? <EOS>	79.07143505715744
<SOS> it would have been more simple . '' <EOS>	103.55532481363667
<SOS> meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men . <EOS>	89.34447777303318
<SOS> he jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant 's arms , and joined them . <EOS>	98.43642635158892
<SOS> he was pale , and his eyes were red and swollen ; it was evident that he had not slept . <EOS>	77.16085432337984
<SOS> a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance , which was not natural to him . <EOS>	95.59776827634337
<SOS> `` i thank you , gentlemen , '' said he , `` for having complied with my request ; i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship . '' <EOS>	107.26325596486278
<SOS> morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached , and remained at a short distance . <EOS>	67.00881779470801
<SOS> `` and to you also , m. morrel , my thanks are due . <EOS>	72.90238702990098

<SOS> `` m. morrel , '' said château renaud , `` will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m. de morcerf is arrived , and we are at his disposal ? '' <EOS>	74.98177682639381
<SOS> morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission . <EOS>	81.27016853128643
<SOS> beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage . <EOS>	83.52859806879029
<SOS> `` stop , gentlemen , '' said albert ; `` i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo . '' <EOS>	82.36344352669286
<SOS> `` in private ? '' <EOS>	86.75772618796827

<SOS> `` no , sir ; before all who are here . '' <EOS>	84.54687655279423
<SOS> albert 's witnesses looked at each other . <EOS>	85.83131314279471
<SOS> franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper , and morrel , rejoiced at this unexpected incident , went to fetch the count , who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel . <EOS>	102.75777351038401
<SOS> `` what does he want with me ? '' <EOS>	83.11370868770418
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	56.211389623335094
<SOS> `` i do not know , but he wishes to speak to you . '' <EOS>	69.49903415684416
<SOS> `` ah ? '' <EOS>	77.97948603617142
<SOS> said monte cristo , `` i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult ! '' <EOS>	77.52106853852669
<SOS> `` i do not think that such is his intention , '' said morrel . <EOS>	97.09799690000541
<SOS> the count advanced , accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel . <EOS>	102.19823226645633
<SOS> his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert 's grief stricken face , who approached also , followed by the other four young men . <EOS>	89.06881166790534
<SOS> when at three paces distant from each other , albert and the count stopped . <EOS>	99.48608920878829
<SOS> `` approach , gentlemen , '' said albert ; `` i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo , for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it , strange as it may appear to you . '' <EOS>	69.8861322881099
<SOS> `` proceed , sir , '' said the count . <EOS>	69.0064431546445
<SOS> `` sir , '' said albert , at first with a tremulous voice , but which gradually became firmer , `` i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m. de morcerf in epirus , for guilty as i knew he was , i thought you had no right to punish him ; but i have since learned that you had that right . <EOS>	92.2922183858976
<SOS> it is not fernand mondego 's treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you , but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you , and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences ; and i say , and proclaim it publicly , that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father , and i , his son , thank you for not using greater severity .

<SOS> had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene , it would not have surprised them more than did albert 's declaration . <EOS>	94.64410612433299
<SOS> as for monte cristo , his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude . <EOS>	62.3075154678725
<SOS> he could not understand how albert 's fiery nature , of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits , had suddenly stooped to this humiliation . <EOS>	68.04131953608322
<SOS> he recognized the influence of mercédès , and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless . <EOS>	97.83168064001785
<SOS> `` now , sir , '' said albert , `` if you think my apology sufficient , pray give me your hand . <EOS>	61.3989015989133
<SOS> next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess , i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault . <EOS>	65.96152242220758
<SOS> but this confession concerns me only . <EOS>	102.43547862922074

<SOS> monte cristo , with moistened eye , heaving breast , and lips half open , extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear . <EOS>	80.19084921946379
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' said he , `` m. de monte cristo receives my apology . <EOS>	83.08952626257548

<SOS> hasty actions are generally bad ones . <EOS>	97.37621535080312

<SOS> i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated . <EOS>	108.6720035927932
<SOS> but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , '' added he , drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies , `` i shall endeavor to correct his mistake . '' <EOS>	91.53716093036675
<SOS> `` what happened during the night ? '' <EOS>	81.71601128489256

<SOS> `` in truth , what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble , '' replied the baron . <EOS>	99.60308609931184
<SOS> `` what can it mean ? '' <EOS>	88.71581509852001

<SOS> as for monte cristo , his head was bent down , his arms were powerless . <EOS>	73.5577705063912
<SOS> bowing under the weight of twenty four years ' reminiscences , he thought not of albert , of beauchamp , of château renaud , or of any of that group ; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son 's life , to whom he had offered his , and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret , capable of destroying forever in that young man 's heart every feeling of filial piety . <EOS>	87.04621138106694

<SOS> albert , beauchamp , and château renaud remained alone . <EOS>	107.09785179941
<SOS> albert looked at his two friends , not timidly , but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done . <EOS>	92.13609315232496
<SOS> `` indeed , my dear friend , '' said beauchamp first , who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation , `` allow me to congratulate you ; this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair . '' <EOS>	69.90549499306333
<SOS> albert remained silent and wrapped in thought . <EOS>	101.96303992907326
<SOS> château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane . <EOS>	82.50829042501908
<SOS> `` are we not going ? '' <EOS>	78.53821696801663
<SOS> said he , after this embarrassing silence . <EOS>	117.61120453666616
<SOS> `` when you please , '' replied beauchamp ; `` allow me only to compliment m. de morcerf , who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity . '' <EOS>	90.91627439443889
<SOS> `` oh , yes , '' said château renaud . <EOS>	58.59127554067216
<SOS> `` it is magnificent , '' continued beauchamp , `` to be able to exercise so much self control ! '' <EOS>	97.62144361647289
<SOS> `` assuredly ; as for me , i should have been incapable of it , '' said château renaud , with most significant coolness . <EOS>	83.65469293751077
<SOS> `` gentlemen , '' interrupted albert , `` i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m. de monte cristo and myself . '' <EOS>	100.31389464647994
<SOS> `` possibly , possibly , '' said beauchamp immediately ; `` but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism , and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life . <EOS>	85.70089979866657

<SOS> `` thank you , gentlemen , '' replied albert , with a smile of indifference ; `` i shall follow your advice not because you give it , but because i had before intended to quit france . <EOS>	96.32426798404694
<SOS> i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds . <EOS>	70.40304886639608
<SOS> it is deeply engraved on my heart , and , after what you have just said , i remember that only . '' <EOS>	61.97455367183349
<SOS> château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other ; the impression was the same on both of them , and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued . <EOS>	87.83556881356633
<SOS> `` good bye , albert , '' said beauchamp suddenly , carelessly extending his hand to the young man . <EOS>	74.89812170867025
<SOS> the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy ; in fact , he did not notice the offered hand . <EOS>	120.2008919797967
<SOS> `` good bye , '' said château renaud in his turn , keeping his little cane in his left hand , and saluting with his right . <EOS>	76.44631852160181
<SOS> albert 's lips scarcely whispered `` good bye , '' but his look was more explicit ; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger , proud disdain , and generous indignation . <EOS>	99.29506739243344
<SOS> he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage ; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it , he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris . <EOS>	87.38930393284019
<SOS> in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder . <EOS>	76.87453903000022
<SOS> as he alighted , he thought he saw his father 's pale face behind the curtain of the count 's bedroom . <EOS>	95.18684148734648
<SOS> albert turned away his head with a sigh , and went to his own apartments . <EOS>	75.63718741039115
<SOS> he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy ; he looked at the pictures , whose faces seemed to smile , and the landscapes , which appeared painted in brighter colors . <EOS>	69.89362148294502
<SOS> then he took away his mother 's portrait , with its oaken frame , leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty . <EOS>	75.21964185638014
<SOS> then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms , his fine english guns , his japanese china , his cups mounted in silver , his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye ; examined the cupboards , and placed the key in each ; threw into a drawer of his secretaire , which he left open , all the pocket money he had about him , and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes ; then he made an exact inventory of everything , and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table , after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there . <EOS>	73.92998148807926
<SOS> at the beginning of this work , his servant , notwithstanding orders to the contrary , came to his room . <EOS>	68.83382397669119
<SOS> `` what do you want ? '' <EOS>	86.98082120404254
<SOS> asked he , with a more sorrowful than angry tone . <EOS>	86.6291200402189
<SOS> `` pardon me , sir , '' replied the valet ; `` you had forbidden me to disturb you , but the count of morcerf has called me . '' <EOS>	86.63723421936588
<SOS> `` well ! '' <EOS>	75.52706030203942

<SOS> `` why ? '' <EOS>	89.60986301334884
<SOS> `` because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning . '' <EOS>	74.23080836310477
<SOS> < num > m `` it is probable , '' said albert . <EOS>	91.69665473205454
<SOS> `` and since he has sent for me , it is doubtless to question me on what happened there . <EOS>	102.95748416075409
<SOS> what must i answer ? '' <EOS>	92.04315544800862
<SOS> `` the truth . '' <EOS>	77.90003262421432

<SOS> the valet bowed and retired , and albert returned to his inventory . <EOS>	98.28386175260563
<SOS> as he was finishing this work , the sound of horses prancing in the yard , and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window , attracted his attention . <EOS>	84.81198613458109
<SOS> he approached the window , and saw his father get into it , and drive away . <EOS>	79.07360081722841
<SOS> the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother 's room ; and , no one being there to announce him , he advanced to her bedchamber , and distressed by what he saw and guessed , stopped for one moment at the door . <EOS>	104.30163573714277
<SOS> as if the same idea had animated these two beings , mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his . <EOS>	91.45015951042683
<SOS> everything was in order , laces , dresses , jewels , linen , money , all were arranged in the drawers , and the countess was carefully collecting the keys . <EOS>	70.2367587979889
<SOS> albert saw all these preparations and understood them , and exclaiming , `` my mother ! '' <EOS>	84.16301780562365
<SOS> he threw his arms around her neck . <EOS>	82.9103626173621
<SOS> the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture . <EOS>	81.33169712724077
<SOS> all these proofs of an energetic resolution , which albert did not fear on his own account , alarmed him for his mother . <EOS>	58.56918138445676
<SOS> `` what are you doing ? '' <EOS>	97.53882478004196
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	95.67978979707036

<SOS> replied she . <EOS>	63.36687778022733
<SOS> `` oh , my mother ! '' <EOS>	78.40944164742044
<SOS> exclaimed albert , so overcome he could scarcely speak ; `` it is not the same with you and me you can not have made the same resolution i have , for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house , and and to you . '' <EOS>	93.38253049332847
<SOS> `` i also , '' replied mercédès , `` am going , and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me ; have i deceived myself ? '' <EOS>	92.0311690763276

<SOS> `` i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself . <EOS>	92.14432989757378

<SOS> so , my dear mother , i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants . '' <EOS>	91.12544524411992

<SOS> `` but not mine , mother , '' replied albert . <EOS>	99.7147287711952
<SOS> `` i am young and strong ; i believe i am courageous , and since yesterday i have learned the power of will . <EOS>	61.86943584216366

<SOS> i have seen that , mother ; i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors , and have punished them . <EOS>	85.96972476338888
<SOS> no , mother ; from this moment i have done with the past , and accept nothing from it not even a name , because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another . '' <EOS>	105.0491073649067

<SOS> `` i am ready , my son , '' said mercédès . <EOS>	99.4516542854893
<SOS> albert ran to fetch a carriage . <EOS>	81.74478813805743
<SOS> he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères , where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging , and thither he intended conducting the countess . <EOS>	58.61284975856856
<SOS> as the carriage stopped at the door , and albert was alighting , a man approached and gave him a letter . <EOS>	84.08408708330747
<SOS> albert recognized the bearer . <EOS>	117.1094677663111
<SOS> `` from the count , '' said bertuccio . <EOS>	72.88853150502649
<SOS> albert took the letter , opened , and read it , then looked round for bertuccio , but he was gone . <EOS>	100.26529549074863
<SOS> he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast , and without uttering a word he gave her the letter . <EOS>	106.25569971756494
<SOS> mercédès read : `` albert , while showing you that i have discovered your plans , i hope also to convince you of my delicacy . <EOS>	89.8604343474129
<SOS> you are free , you leave the count 's house , and you take your mother to your home ; but reflect , albert , you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her . <EOS>	63.13789208856384
<SOS> keep the struggle for yourself , bear all the suffering , but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts ; for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her , and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty . <EOS>	78.81045376530447

<SOS> you are a generous man , albert , but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment ; if you refuse me , if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you , i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair . '' <EOS>	89.29198856701443
<SOS> albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter . <EOS>	91.35686257661435
<SOS> mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven . <EOS>	68.35657188797981

<SOS> monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man . <EOS>	114.41026349141393
<SOS> `` well , '' continued the latter , `` since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes , it is elsewhere , and i must go and find it . '' <EOS>	97.43428760598556
<SOS> `` go , '' said the count deliberately ; `` go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world , that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love , and that i love you , morrel . '' <EOS>	71.87953851524341
<SOS> < num > m `` i will remember it , '' said the young man , `` as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid . <EOS>	104.4400592800343

<SOS> `` good bye , till we meet again . '' <EOS>	93.16920113871835
<SOS> they had arrived in the champs élysées . <EOS>	57.98480695894912
<SOS> monte cristo opened the carriage door , morrel sprang out on the pavement , bertuccio was waiting on the steps . <EOS>	71.84135921166688
<SOS> morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny , and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio . <EOS>	95.32654614023784
<SOS> `` well ? '' <EOS>	92.14545630070371
<SOS> asked he . <EOS>	83.37056920199143
<SOS> `` she is going to leave her house , '' said the steward . <EOS>	103.56811503284746
<SOS> `` and her son ? '' <EOS>	85.04684482336515
<SOS> `` florentin , his valet , thinks he is going to do the same . '' <EOS>	69.82746937354484
<SOS> `` come this way . '' <EOS>	74.93294726285275
<SOS> monte cristo took bertuccio into his study , wrote the letter we have seen , and gave it to the steward . <EOS>	91.99479558421164
<SOS> `` go , '' said he quickly . <EOS>	82.42954828313606
<SOS> `` but first , let haydée be informed that i have returned . '' <EOS>	92.1393340442625
<SOS> `` here i am , '' said the young girl , who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely . <EOS>	109.4249804612302
<SOS> bertuccio left . <EOS>	76.9397145162713
<SOS> every transport of a daughter finding a father , all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting , which she had so eagerly expected . <EOS>	73.17625668601866
<SOS> doubtless , although less evident , monte cristo 's joy was not less intense . <EOS>	85.26782647585009
<SOS> joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought ; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them , and nothing is outwardly apparent . <EOS>	82.35500267086957
<SOS> monte cristo was beginning to think , what he had not for a long time dared to believe , that there were two mercédès in the world , and he might yet be happy . <EOS>	100.18331915789238
<SOS> his eye , elate with happiness , was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée , when suddenly the door opened . <EOS>	78.33817862351866
<SOS> the count knit his brow . <EOS>	72.46978872748264
<SOS> `` m. de morcerf ! '' <EOS>	107.38643489697465
<SOS> said baptistin , as if that name sufficed for his excuse . <EOS>	114.04511620288166
<SOS> in fact , the count 's face brightened . <EOS>	73.65615315266531
<SOS> `` which , '' asked he , `` the viscount or the count ? '' <EOS>	62.277686446113286
<SOS> `` the count . '' <EOS>	74.47582622572047
<SOS> `` oh , '' exclaimed haydée , `` is it not yet over ? '' <EOS>	85.10176753844361
<SOS> `` i know not if it is finished , my beloved child , '' said monte cristo , taking the young girl 's hands ; `` but i do know you have nothing more to fear . '' <EOS>	69.55135691861294
<SOS> `` but it is the wretched `` `` that man can not injure me , haydée , '' said monte cristo ; `` it was his son alone that there was cause to fear . '' <EOS>	104.29549092877585
<SOS> `` and what i have suffered , '' said the young girl , `` you shall never know , my lord . '' <EOS>	73.0430962810724
<SOS> monte cristo smiled . <EOS>	102.07802698231305
<SOS> `` by my father 's tomb , '' said he , extending his hand over the head of the young girl , `` i swear to you , haydée , that if any misfortune happens , it will not be to me . '' <EOS>	77.55026897964774
<SOS> `` i believe you , my lord , as implicitly as if god had spoken to me , '' said the young girl , presenting her forehead to him . <EOS>	68.61872435467697
<SOS> monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once , the one violently , the other secretly . <EOS>	99.55155100547513
<SOS> `` oh , '' murmured the count , `` shall i then be permitted to love again ? <EOS>	118.9257440017331
<SOS> ask m. de morcerf into the drawing room , '' said he to baptistin , while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase . <EOS>	105.15120715511591
<SOS> we must explain this visit , which although expected by monte cristo , is unexpected to our readers . <EOS>	85.80982836368369
<SOS> while mercédès , as we have said , was making a similar inventory of her property to albert 's , while she was arranging her jewels , shutting her drawers , collecting her keys , to leave everything in perfect order , she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage , from which everything could be both seen and heard . <EOS>	74.50945414139352
<SOS> he who was thus looking , without being heard or seen , probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf 's apartments . <EOS>	96.04755697951191
<SOS> from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count 's bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard . <EOS>	91.03189561707079
<SOS> he remained there ten minutes , motionless and dumb , listening to the beating of his own heart . <EOS>	88.716867102887
<SOS> for him those ten minutes were very long . <EOS>	79.40144851292645
<SOS> it was then albert , returning from his meeting with the count , perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain , and turned aside . <EOS>	87.36625831360136
<SOS> the count 's eye expanded ; he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully , and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel . <EOS>	84.16373658381998
<SOS> albert returned safely then the count was revenged . <EOS>	97.7973379427617
<SOS> an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect , not of a downy couch , but of a tomb . <EOS>	77.53419569419466
<SOS> but as we have said , he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph . <EOS>	86.55490868655279
<SOS> he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father 's honor ; but when that was done , why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms ? <EOS>	83.55472700205753
<SOS> it was then , when the count could not see albert , that he sent for his servant , who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him . <EOS>	110.13914235995378
<SOS> ten minutes afterwards , general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar , black pantaloons , and black gloves . <EOS>	87.65068543648202
<SOS> he had apparently given previous orders , for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him . <EOS>	91.89327348038756
<SOS> the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak , in which two swords were wrapped , and , shutting the door , he took his seat by the side of the coachman . <EOS>	96.04653761230868
<SOS> the coachman stooped down for his orders . <EOS>	70.53249344551999
<SOS> `` to the champs élysées , '' said the general ; `` the count of monte cristo 's . <EOS>	90.25870199479179
<SOS> hurry ! '' <EOS>	78.56859566877071
<SOS> the horses bounded beneath the whip ; and in five minutes they stopped before the count 's door . <EOS>	104.37099416688473
<SOS> m. de morcerf opened the door himself , and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk , rang , and entered the open door with his servant . <EOS>	73.68672406239146
<SOS> a moment afterwards , baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo , and the latter , leading haydée aside , ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room . <EOS>	89.16577997495602
<SOS> the general was pacing the room the third time when , in turning , he perceived monte cristo at the door . <EOS>	65.32534622219637
<SOS> `` ah , it is m. de morcerf , '' said monte cristo quietly ; `` i thought i had not heard aright . '' <EOS>	71.42549479838198
<SOS> `` yes , it is i , '' said the count , whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely . <EOS>	83.62279590631395
<SOS> `` may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m. de morcerf so early ? '' <EOS>	77.71902459710094
<SOS> `` had you not a meeting with my son this morning ? '' <EOS>	83.32618149846228
<SOS> asked the general . <EOS>	102.90276612414573
<SOS> `` i had , '' replied the count . <EOS>	124.74688401935838
<SOS> `` and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you , and to endeavor to kill you . '' <EOS>	61.962876927597264
<SOS> `` yes , sir , he had very good ones ; but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me , and did not even fight . '' <EOS>	85.11753018237106
<SOS> `` yet he considered you the cause of his father 's dishonor , the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house . '' <EOS>	95.6945950711269
<SOS> `` it is true , sir , '' said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness ; `` a secondary cause , but not the principal . '' <EOS>	99.74074820520075
<SOS> `` doubtless you made , then , some apology or explanation ? '' <EOS>	102.4300267772909
<SOS> `` i explained nothing , and it is he who apologized to me . '' <EOS>	79.33112314448202
<SOS> `` but to what do you attribute this conduct ? '' <EOS>	94.19088447752823
<SOS> `` to the conviction , probably , that there was one more guilty than i . '' <EOS>	96.30207109090992
<SOS> `` and who was that ? '' <EOS>	99.58811068775006
<SOS> `` his father . '' <EOS>	61.75244631151012
<SOS> `` that may be , '' said the count , turning pale ; `` but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted . '' <EOS>	53.569168070274436
<SOS> `` i know it , and i expected this result . '' <EOS>	55.35746337282322
<SOS> `` you expected my son would be a coward ? '' <EOS>	92.44636963598906
<SOS> cried the count . <EOS>	81.47514574464607
<SOS> `` m. albert de morcerf is no coward ! '' <EOS>	65.94361389368333
<SOS> said monte cristo . <EOS>	77.87768889410862
<SOS> `` a man who holds a sword in his hand , and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword , and does not fight , is a coward ! <EOS>	75.71817833859123
<SOS> why is he not here that i may tell him so ? '' <EOS>	78.43403451038965
<SOS> `` sir , '' replied monte cristo coldly , `` i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs . <EOS>	73.73110515007292
<SOS> go and tell m. albert that , and he may know what to answer you . '' <EOS>	94.81305832997165
<SOS> `` oh , no , no , '' said the general , smiling faintly , `` i did not come for that purpose ; you are right . <EOS>	77.94856174563034
<SOS> i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy . <EOS>	76.45028111250718
<SOS> i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively ; that it seems as if i had always known you , and always hated you ; and , in short , since the young people of the present day will not fight , it remains for us to do so . <EOS>	80.09845367430681
<SOS> do you think so , sir ? '' <EOS>	65.91884592568906
<SOS> `` certainly . <EOS>	79.4714636250034

<SOS> `` so much the better . <EOS>	83.09304014858978

<SOS> `` yes , sir . '' <EOS>	72.34132394939165

<SOS> i know well , demon , that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past , and that you have read , by the light of what torch i know not , every page of my life ; but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings . <EOS>	105.55263950319353

<SOS> the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale ; his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire . <EOS>	87.68039915193505
<SOS> he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom , and in less than a moment , tearing off his cravat , his coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailor 's jacket and hat , from beneath which rolled his long black hair . <EOS>	101.76712526685372
<SOS> he returned thus , formidable and implacable , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand . <EOS>	116.21527262233892

<SOS> < num > m the general , with his head thrown back , hands extended , gaze fixed , looked silently at this dreadful apparition ; then seeking the wall to support him , he glided along close to it until he reached the door , through which he went out backwards , uttering this single mournful , lamentable , distressing cry : `` edmond dantès ! '' <EOS>	100.92441229815229
<SOS> then , with sighs which were unlike any human sound , he dragged himself to the door , reeled across the courtyard , and falling into the arms of his valet , he said in a voice scarcely intelligible , `` home , home . '' <EOS>	95.68989305193475
<SOS> the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants , partly recalled his senses , but the ride was short , and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived . <EOS>	65.24183809363109
<SOS> he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted . <EOS>	62.15058022727474
<SOS> the door was wide open , a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion ; the count looked at it with terror , but without daring to inquire its meaning , he rushed towards his apartment . <EOS>	88.50700620252798
<SOS> two persons were coming down the stairs ; he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them . <EOS>	92.69247116102868
<SOS> it was mercédès leaning on her son 's arm and leaving the house . <EOS>	66.61778149678129
<SOS> they passed close by the unhappy being , who , concealed behind the damask curtain , almost felt mercédès dress brush past him , and his son 's warm breath , pronouncing these words : `` courage , mother ! <EOS>	99.59131881074553
<SOS> come , this is no longer our home ! '' <EOS>	103.25905743021279
<SOS> the words died away , the steps were lost in the distance . <EOS>	70.01711548424065
<SOS> the general drew himself up , clinging to the curtain ; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son . <EOS>	84.61324374608316
<SOS> he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach , then the coachman 's voice , and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows . <EOS>	123.8215411921121
<SOS> he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world ; but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband . <EOS>	79.09624147154128
<SOS> and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard , and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window , which was broken by the explosion . <EOS>	90.09834807467871

<SOS> on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort 's ; we say slowly , for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps , but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts . <EOS>	85.85860960481324
<SOS> he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast , and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty . <EOS>	101.37816904296123
<SOS> noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week , and he was now availing himself of that permission . <EOS>	98.61378816857959
<SOS> he arrived ; valentine was expecting him . <EOS>	102.09585437952767
<SOS> uneasy and almost crazed , she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather . <EOS>	86.41510840969296
<SOS> this uneasiness , amounting almost to frenzy , arose from the report morcerf 's adventure had made in the world , for the affair at the opera was generally known . <EOS>	101.07303378511874
<SOS> no one at villefort 's doubted that a duel would ensue from it . <EOS>	62.544493020397255
<SOS> valentine , with her woman 's instinct , guessed that morrel would be monte cristo 's second , and from the young man 's well known courage and his great affection for the count , she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him . <EOS>	114.41527420203857
<SOS> we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for , given , and received ; and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved , when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected . <EOS>	75.20569182942147
<SOS> `` now , '' said valentine , motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather , while she took her seat on his footstool , `` now let us talk about our own affairs . <EOS>	80.04196468569535

<SOS> `` and grandpapa has become my physician , and i have the greatest confidence in him , because he knows everything . '' <EOS>	113.64408899637607
<SOS> `` do you then really suffer ? '' <EOS>	107.31734689676152
<SOS> asked morrel quickly . <EOS>	71.7920731821177
<SOS> `` oh , it must not be called suffering ; i feel a general uneasiness , that is all . <EOS>	78.35613139808034
<SOS> i have lost my appetite , and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something . '' <EOS>	86.036360031363
<SOS> noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said . <EOS>	109.24089681420028
<SOS> `` and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint ? '' <EOS>	122.85583436431259
<SOS> `` a very simple one , '' said valentine . <EOS>	81.34231348355372
<SOS> `` i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather . <EOS>	74.70132265325297
<SOS> when i say one spoonful , i began by one now i take four . <EOS>	64.64288068246034
<SOS> grandpapa says it is a panacea . '' <EOS>	120.68477692470357
<SOS> valentine smiled , but it was evident that she suffered . <EOS>	80.14733847998414
<SOS> maximilian , in his devotedness , gazed silently at her . <EOS>	96.38075503179198
<SOS> she was very beautiful , but her usual pallor had increased ; her eyes were more brilliant than ever , and her hands , which were generally white like mother of pearl , now more resembled wax , to which time was adding a yellowish hue . <EOS>	84.92645755403811
<SOS> from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier . <EOS>	64.63757076033403
<SOS> the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her affection , and he also , like morrel , followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover . <EOS>	86.3871215921843
<SOS> `` but , '' said morrel , `` i thought this mixture , of which you now take four spoonfuls , was prepared for m . <EOS>	84.88867719447944
<SOS> noirtier ? '' <EOS>	70.31559954163144
<SOS> `` i know it is very bitter , '' said valentine ; `` so bitter , that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste . '' <EOS>	90.3884604291607
<SOS> noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter . <EOS>	90.2406790544392
<SOS> `` yes , grandpapa , '' said valentine ; `` it is so . <EOS>	80.78756146310907
<SOS> just now , before i came down to you , i drank a glass of sugared water ; i left half , because it seemed so bitter . '' <EOS>	77.81677742785357
<SOS> noirtier turned pale , and made a sign that he wished to speak . <EOS>	96.24929900486738
<SOS> valentine rose to fetch the dictionary . <EOS>	75.0143223338516
<SOS> noirtier watched her with evident anguish . <EOS>	84.33813155666171
<SOS> in fact , the blood was rushing to the young girl 's head already , her cheeks were becoming red . <EOS>	87.54095535066774
<SOS> `` oh , '' cried she , without losing any of her cheerfulness , `` this is singular ! <EOS>	84.6297310766979
<SOS> i ca n't see ! <EOS>	74.69813917348274
<SOS> did the sun shine in my eyes ? '' <EOS>	88.80739345192804
<SOS> and she leaned against the window . <EOS>	108.95324724771179
<SOS> `` the sun is not shining , '' said morrel , more alarmed by noirtier 's expression than by valentine 's indisposition . <EOS>	96.52733000351132
<SOS> he ran towards her . <EOS>	69.66517860691759
<SOS> the young girl smiled . <EOS>	77.63269354755695
<SOS> `` cheer up , '' said she to noirtier . <EOS>	74.98997105333908
<SOS> `` do not be alarmed , maximilian ; it is nothing , and has already passed away . <EOS>	79.13050255674935
<SOS> but listen ! <EOS>	99.17265656149556
<SOS> do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard ? '' <EOS>	62.81818357951349
<SOS> she opened noirtier 's door , ran to a window in the passage , and returned hastily . <EOS>	76.33920739637772
<SOS> `` yes , '' said she , `` it is madame danglars and her daughter , who have come to call on us . <EOS>	59.867099908520146
<SOS> good bye ; i must run away , for they would send here for me , or , rather , farewell till i see you again . <EOS>	76.83370049213889
<SOS> stay with grandpapa , maximilian ; i promise you not to persuade them to stay . '' <EOS>	79.7181617584786
<SOS> < num > m morrel watched her as she left the room ; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort 's apartments and to hers . <EOS>	78.85269117286285
<SOS> as soon as she was gone , noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary . <EOS>	60.56461365535947
<SOS> morrel obeyed ; guided by valentine , he had learned how to understand the old man quickly . <EOS>	88.78412121786688
<SOS> accustomed , however , as he was to the work , he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary , so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words , `` fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine 's room . '' <EOS>	85.82230536246993
<SOS> morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois 's situation , and in noirtier 's name gave that order . <EOS>	83.99428117741135
<SOS> the servant soon returned . <EOS>	82.28533104975111
<SOS> the decanter and the glass were completely empty . <EOS>	83.67692863334135
<SOS> noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak . <EOS>	79.05055445888392
<SOS> `` why are the glass and decanter empty ? '' <EOS>	90.5381631583996
<SOS> asked he ; `` valentine said she only drank half the glassful . '' <EOS>	73.19554608857857
<SOS> the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes . <EOS>	76.95743247871546
<SOS> `` i do not know , '' said the servant , `` but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine 's room : perhaps she has emptied them . '' <EOS>	107.08802944480227
<SOS> `` ask her , '' said morrel , translating noirtier 's thought this time by his look . <EOS>	106.77907125042067
<SOS> the servant went out , but returned almost immediately . <EOS>	81.18123444690778
<SOS> `` mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort 's , '' said he ; `` and in passing , as she was thirsty , she drank what remained in the glass ; as for the decanter , master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks . '' <EOS>	85.93324461679572
<SOS> noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke . <EOS>	90.55058781634179
<SOS> from that moment the old man 's eyes were fixed on the door , and did not quit it . <EOS>	86.44357364764677
<SOS> it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen ; they had been ushered into madame de villefort 's room , who had said she would receive them there . <EOS>	79.34506659075734
<SOS> that is why valentine passed through her room , which was on a level with valentine 's , and only separated from it by edward 's . <EOS>	86.55497463718802
<SOS> the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication . <EOS>	104.44581639056277
<SOS> among worldly people manner is contagious . <EOS>	85.4615034993818
<SOS> madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity . <EOS>	95.43793566466998
<SOS> valentine entered at this moment , and the formalities were resumed . <EOS>	78.64833186147706
<SOS> `` my dear friend , '' said the baroness , while the two young people were shaking hands , `` i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti . '' <EOS>	75.4664108533285
<SOS> danglars kept up the title of prince . <EOS>	109.68262274688482
<SOS> the popular banker found that it answered better than count . <EOS>	103.41773569162574
<SOS> `` allow me to present you my sincere congratulations , '' replied madame de villefort . <EOS>	76.62099554002586
<SOS> `` prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities . '' <EOS>	94.87614292253609
<SOS> < num > m `` listen , '' said the baroness , smiling ; `` speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be . <EOS>	58.50308272400906
<SOS> he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize , at first sight , the italian or german nobleman . <EOS>	94.55626809151723
<SOS> besides , he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition , much keenness of wit , and as to suitability , m. danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic that is his word . '' <EOS>	75.46925913814347
<SOS> `` and then , '' said eugénie , while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort 's album , `` add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man . '' <EOS>	92.98333437286736
<SOS> `` and , '' said madame de villefort , `` i need not ask you if you share that fancy . '' <EOS>	76.30358100666497
<SOS> `` i ? '' <EOS>	91.63404319982205
<SOS> replied eugénie with her usual candor . <EOS>	84.51938472338598
<SOS> `` oh , not the least in the world , madame ! <EOS>	90.9368730073094
<SOS> my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares , or the caprices of any man , but to be an artist , and consequently free in heart , in person , and in thought . '' <EOS>	66.31568988985174
<SOS> eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine 's cheeks . <EOS>	80.02744875384286
<SOS> the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman . <EOS>	83.06649253744374
<SOS> `` at any rate , '' said she , `` since i am to be married whether i will or not , i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m. albert de morcerf , or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man . '' <EOS>	92.86456473383757
<SOS> `` it is true , '' said the baroness , with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies , and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them , `` it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated , my daughter would have married monsieur albert . <EOS>	81.31577256483148
<SOS> the general depended much on it ; he even came to force m. danglars . <EOS>	90.75323997662738
<SOS> we have had a narrow escape . '' <EOS>	94.30764475378389
<SOS> `` but , '' said valentine , timidly , `` does all the father 's shame revert upon the son ? <EOS>	75.52532059381065
<SOS> monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general . '' <EOS>	81.05540057345053
<SOS> `` excuse me , '' said the implacable young girl , `` monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share . <EOS>	82.27441274299585
<SOS> it appears that after having challenged m. de monte cristo at the opera yesterday , he apologized on the ground today . '' <EOS>	101.62388939410734
<SOS> `` impossible , '' said madame de villefort . <EOS>	79.38383307618714
<SOS> `` ah , my dear friend , '' said madame danglars , with the same simplicity we before noticed , `` it is a fact . <EOS>	77.09402736349384
<SOS> i heard it from m. debray , who was present at the explanation . '' <EOS>	96.17952662201961
<SOS> valentine also knew the truth , but she did not answer . <EOS>	78.89947712710318
<SOS> a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m. noirtier 's room . <EOS>	84.14881339358939
<SOS> deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation , valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation . <EOS>	89.09532927629785
<SOS> she would , indeed , have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes , when suddenly madame danglars ' hand , pressed on her arm , aroused her from her lethargy . <EOS>	105.0970044979538
<SOS> `` what is it ? '' <EOS>	85.83660340229409
<SOS> said she , starting at madame danglars ' touch as she would have done from an electric shock . <EOS>	71.97081996882223
<SOS> `` it is , my dear valentine , '' said the baroness , `` that you are , doubtless , suffering . '' <EOS>	74.9805150529326
<SOS> < num > m `` i ? '' <EOS>	76.48309558187108
<SOS> said the young girl , passing her hand across her burning forehead . <EOS>	96.19923973823006
<SOS> `` yes , look at yourself in that glass ; you have turned pale and then red successively , three or four times in one minute . '' <EOS>	97.34925219628364
<SOS> `` indeed , '' cried eugénie , `` you are very pale ! '' <EOS>	80.1400336866936
<SOS> `` oh , do not be alarmed ; i have been so for many days . '' <EOS>	89.45607684486063
<SOS> artless as she was , the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave , and besides , madame de villefort came to her assistance . <EOS>	88.64127038855045
<SOS> `` retire , valentine , '' said she ; `` you are really suffering , and these ladies will excuse you ; drink a glass of pure water , it will restore you . '' <EOS>	101.99314779273426
<SOS> valentine kissed eugénie , bowed to madame danglars , who had already risen to take her leave , and went out . <EOS>	89.40761912952016
<SOS> `` that poor child , '' said madame de villefort when valentine was gone , `` she makes me very uneasy , and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness . '' <EOS>	109.1824087737121
<SOS> meanwhile , valentine , in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand , had crossed edward 's room without noticing some trick of the child , and through her own had reached the little staircase . <EOS>	76.72444119154656
<SOS> she was within three steps of the bottom ; she already heard morrel 's voice , when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes , her stiffened foot missed the step , her hands had no power to hold the baluster , and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor . <EOS>	87.93769555092153
<SOS> morrel bounded to the door , opened it , and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs . <EOS>	62.88777403777467
<SOS> quick as a flash , he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair . <EOS>	82.79692021730953
<SOS> valentine opened her eyes . <EOS>	108.77274792694514
<SOS> `` oh , what a clumsy thing i am , '' said she with feverish volubility ; `` i do n't know my way . <EOS>	62.41824344124714
<SOS> i forgot there were three more steps before the landing . '' <EOS>	89.49609910090253
<SOS> `` you have hurt yourself , perhaps , '' said morrel . <EOS>	64.17827904928467
<SOS> `` what can i do for you , valentine ? '' <EOS>	86.44576607422198
<SOS> valentine looked around her ; she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier 's eyes . <EOS>	80.56115143886639
<SOS> `` do n't worry , dear grandpapa , '' said she , endeavoring to smile ; `` it is nothing it is nothing ; i was giddy , that is all . '' <EOS>	107.58507353193859
<SOS> `` another attack of giddiness , '' said morrel , clasping his hands . <EOS>	111.57981434089584
<SOS> `` oh , attend to it , valentine , i entreat you . '' <EOS>	85.95034155570941
<SOS> `` but no , '' said valentine , `` no , i tell you it is all past , and it was nothing . <EOS>	101.91315288500397
<SOS> now , let me tell you some news ; eugénie is to be married in a week , and in three days there is to be a grand feast , a betrothal festival . <EOS>	92.04793157426165
<SOS> we are all invited , my father , madame de villefort , and i at least , i understood it so . '' <EOS>	78.31662323272987
<SOS> `` when will it be our turn to think of these things ? <EOS>	91.84966555392174
<SOS> oh , valentine , you who have so much influence over your grandpapa , try to make him answer soon . '' <EOS>	97.33699732725326
<SOS> `` and do you , '' said valentine , `` depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa ? '' <EOS>	70.1640374452539
<SOS> `` yes , '' cried morrel , `` make haste . <EOS>	67.95704626910565
<SOS> so long as you are not mine , valentine , i shall always think i may lose you . '' <EOS>	101.16758683415881
<SOS> `` oh , '' replied valentine with a convulsive movement , `` oh , indeed , maximilian , you are too timid for an officer , for a soldier who , they say , never knows fear . <EOS>	85.39457829090965
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! '' <EOS>	92.72373878813067
<SOS> she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh , her arms stiffened and twisted , her head fell back on her chair , and she remained motionless . <EOS>	101.56868052899866
<SOS> the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier 's lips , seemed to start from his eyes . <EOS>	94.78351040985659
<SOS> morrel understood it ; he knew he must call assistance . <EOS>	90.46361618330417
<SOS> the young man rang the bell violently ; the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine 's room , and the servant who had replaced barrois , ran in at the same moment . <EOS>	87.55806179330155
<SOS> valentine was so pale , so cold , so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house , and they flew into the passage crying for help . <EOS>	91.42487495915361
<SOS> madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment ; they heard the cause of the disturbance . <EOS>	78.81355786803374
<SOS> `` i told you so ! '' <EOS>	78.32936345364142
<SOS> exclaimed madame de villefort . <EOS>	84.58752858281235
